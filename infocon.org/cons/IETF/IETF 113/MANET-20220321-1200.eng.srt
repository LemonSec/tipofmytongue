1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,039
so i forgot how to share my slides

2
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,440
something

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,559
relax over here

4
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,719
um

5
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,399
so you have to import it first

6
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,640
here so now we go back

7
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,040
for those of you online we're just

8
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,040
waiting for those slides to get set up

9
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,679
and in the room

10
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,319
um

11
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,720
okay

12
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
we got the slides up

13
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,560
yes

14
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
so i guess it's time to start

15
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,680
welcome everybody to this

16
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,920
hybrid meeting the

17
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,680
working group

18
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,480
also on behalf of my co-chair don felix

19
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,799
who is remote whereas i'm on site

20
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,680
and our area director of raw

21
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,760
dharma is in the room also on site

22
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,359
you're still a little faint

23
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,680
you can get maybe closer to the mic

24
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,400
not without

25
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,439
swallowing it actually

26
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,000
so this is the note well

27
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,440
and this session is being recorded

28
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,639
take note of the note well

29
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,240
everything

30
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
that you say in here is an idea of

31
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,600
contribution and there are some other

32
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,120
important points as well

33
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,800
i see a message in the chat to turn up

34
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,000
the mig game i have no control over that

35
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,479
i have a microphone right in front of me

36
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,719
and i

37
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,919
cannot

38
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,880
get

39
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,680
can you try maybe the other mic up near

40
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,440
the front can you take that off the

41
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,639
podium and just use

42
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,360
that this better

43
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
yes

44
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,440
okay then

45
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,039
are we using this one

46
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,680
um

47
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,800
here are some

48
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,680
hints tips for uh

49
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,759
both in-person and remote participants

50
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,600
this is only the second slot of the day

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,759
this so maybe you're not

52
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
quite familiar with this

53
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,800
in person

54
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
people in the room here

55
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,520
can make use of this special onsite tool

56
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,240
which runs on

57
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,280
mobile devices

58
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,720
and they

59
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
can use this to

60
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,280
[Music]

61
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
scan the qr code

62
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,400
and thereby sign the blue siege

63
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,039
if you go to the mick

64
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,639
to say something

65
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,039
please do not remove your mask you have

66
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,199
to wear your mask at all times and even

67
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,479
i as a chair have to wear the mask

68
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,280
here are some resources

69
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
here is who we are

70
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,560
don and myself

71
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,199
and our responsible id

72
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,160
and the mailing lists

73
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,080
here's the agenda for this afternoon

74
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,400
we have a fairly short agenda

75
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
we may have me

76
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,599
go through it uh before

77
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,280
the hour is over

78
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,199
however

79
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
i really would like to uh

80
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,319
to achieve two things in this meeting

81
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,120
and that's uh

82
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,039
sort of a decision to be confirmed on

83
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,000
the mailing list of course about how to

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
proceed

85
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,240
with the credit-based flow control

86
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
documents

87
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,919
that have been under a

88
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,440
transport area

89
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,000
early review

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,080
and

91
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,880
specifically there has been a suggestion

92
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,840
to

93
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,440
merge two of these documents

94
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,479
and i would really like to

95
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,080
hear the opinion of the working group

96
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,759
and also the

97
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,080
author lou berger and his his co-authors

98
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,919
defer to the working group on this so we

99
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,680
have to form an opinion on this and then

100
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,759
take it from there

101
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,759
another thing is that we have a working

102
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,120
group adoption call running for

103
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,919
one of the five related drafts by

104
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,400
henning roger

105
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
the one on radio band parameters

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,720
this means frequency and bandwidth

107
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,199
some discussion has been started on the

108
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,560
mailing list and that's good

109
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
we started the

110
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
adoption goal

111
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,800
and i really like to hear some more

112
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,360
opinions

113
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,599
then we come to future work but that's

114
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,759
not very much different from

115
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,240
what was on the slide

116
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,520
last time

117
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,799
and then

118
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,120
if time allows i have a little bit of a

119
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
different thing

120
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,679
nothing to do with dlab but something

121
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,279
that

122
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,560
i've been working on myself

123
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,720
and

124
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,519
it allows

125
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,680
simplified multicast forwarding rfc 6621

126
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,120
1

127
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
to make use of

128
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,680
npr information from

129
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,600
osrv2

130
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
in the thing called the source-based npr

131
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,519
and let's see if we can get to that

132
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,560
document status

133
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
as that

134
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,160
three

135
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,240
credit-based flow control drafts have

136
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
been under

137
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
tsv

138
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,760
area review team review

139
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,120
we got some feedback

140
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,240
the end of november last year

141
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,279
i apologize for not responding to that

142
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,760
earlier

143
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,160
lou berger on behalf of the authors

144
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,480
has also responded fairly recently

145
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,800
he has taken a lot of comments from

146
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,839
david black the reviewer on board

147
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,240
and this has resulted in the issuing of

148
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,040
new

149
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
versions of these documents

150
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,240
however

151
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,160
one main point and we're coming to that

152
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,880
on the next agenda item is this

153
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,040
discussion on to merge or not to merge

154
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
we had one other

155
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,800
document in the same series

156
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,359
this was on

157
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,690
ether based

158
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,959
[Music]

159
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,560
credit flow control or i should say

160
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,560
802.11802.1.2

161
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,839
aware

162
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,040
um

163
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,480
credit based flow control

164
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,519
that was not part of the

165
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,440
package that we sent to

166
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
tsv

167
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
to the area review team

168
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
because it was a little bit behind at

169
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,399
the time it was still in the working

170
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,360
group

171
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
it now has

172
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
passed working group last call

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,800
and we have to decide what to do with it

174
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
with this contingent on the discussion

175
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
that we're having

176
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,920
on the merging or not merging of the

177
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
other drafts

178
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,480
then we have the running

179
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,920
adoption call for

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,360
the d-lab radio band extension

181
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,240
there are two more

182
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,839
proposed extensions by the same

183
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,610
author and we

184
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,680
[Music]

185
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,519
should revive

186
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
the discussion on that on the mailing

187
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
list

188
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,399
we're coming to the second point of the

189
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,360
agenda now which is the

190
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
um the discussion on the credit based

191
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
flow control

192
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,040
draft documents

193
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,240
that's said these have been a review

194
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,440
good comments from the reviewer

195
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,200
lots of those comments taken on board

196
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,160
however dave black strongly suggests

197
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,959
that the

198
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,839
div server where credit extension

199
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,160
and the traffic classification drafts

200
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,000
are merged

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
because the

202
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,480
di credit extension is a very short

203
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
draft

204
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,560
this has been noticed by uh

205
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,399
by other people before like ending roger

206
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
and

207
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,079
he thinks it would help implementers

208
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
would it would make things more clear

209
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,880
for implementers if this was to become

210
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,680
one document

211
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,480
and as said the authors

212
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
think that the working group

213
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,360
should decide because it was the working

214
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
group that decided to split these

215
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,399
documents in the first place

216
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,360
and so it seems appropriate that

217
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,839
the working group has a say in how to go

218
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,600
forward with this

219
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
that's the discussion that i want to

220
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,000
have

221
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,040
after

222
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
lou has presented a bit of the

223
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
history

224
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,160
behind all of this because

225
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,199
this is a very long-running

226
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,240
thing

227
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,440
that started before my co-chair and i

228
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,320
were chairs of this working group

229
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,079
and we have to bring this to some

230
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,920
conclusion and not

231
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,680
go flip-flopping between splitting and

232
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,479
merging forever

233
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,240
i do want to add that if we decide to

234
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
follow the suggestion by david black

235
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,639
that there will be an impact

236
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,839
on that one draft that's still

237
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,920
limping behind

238
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,160
the

239
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,360
ether

240
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
credit based flow control

241
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,760
because that's

242
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,000
dependent on the traffic classification

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,680
draft in the same way that the div

244
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,959
server

245
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,120
document is

246
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880
so

247
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,839
if we merge

248
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,600
of aware

249
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,160
with traffic classification

250
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,839
and we also

251
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,079
diff serve

252
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,399
we also merge

253
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,160
ether based

254
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,720
with traffic classification

255
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,240
we get

256
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,959
two documents with

257
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,800
roughly

258
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,199
60 70 percent

259
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,000
the same content

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,279
and that's that's strange

261
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,519
i think so then we would have to look at

262
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,839
the traffic classification

263
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,480
uh how we could possibly rework that and

264
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,959
maybe uh

265
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,880
divide that up into two separate

266
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,519
documents and then merge one with div

267
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
serverware and

268
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,040
the other one with the eta based

269
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,320
but that's a

270
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,760
painful surgery i would say

271
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,519
so now i would

272
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,040
like to give

273
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,599
lu burger

274
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,040
the chance to

275
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,839
refresh some of the ideas behind all

276
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,040
this

277
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,759
is that okay lou

278
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,880
sure happy good

279
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,519
go ahead and i will uh

280
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,120
well next slide i think you covered a

281
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,600
lot of what i was going to say um you

282
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
know basically

283
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,519
no no no i'm actually even happier that

284
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,639
you did it

285
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,160
because as you said it's a working group

286
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,720
decision it's not an author decision

287
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,600
so we have um these old very old

288
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,079
documents the fourth one had trailed

289
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,759
behind i think at this point effectively

290
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,040
it has caught up

291
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,160
um

292
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,720
the working group had made the call to

293
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
break them apart largely because

294
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
then you from a conformance standpoint

295
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,079
you would issue you would say um you

296
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,160
know as a as a user you could say or as

297
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,920
a vendor you could say we can form with

298
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,079
this rfc and it's unambiguous which

299
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,120
parts that you uh support

300
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
um there was some concern that if they

301
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
were a single document it would imply

302
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,199
that you supported everything

303
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,240
and

304
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,720
that was the you know from my view that

305
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
was the the rationale behind the split

306
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,720
up um

307
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
and oh i'm really talking to the next

308
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,000
slide but anyway uh uh

309
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
doesn't matter uh no no it's okay go

310
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,759
back

311
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,000
um so so that's you know that's really

312
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
going back

313
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
uh ancient history and these are really

314
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
old documents that have really been

315
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,119
slowed down based on you know what's

316
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,880
going on in the working group

317
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
um

318
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,760
the

319
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,799
the

320
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,319
it doesn't seem like there's much

321
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,520
technical

322
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,839
open issues on this uh the documents

323
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,839
have been stable a very long time

324
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,919
david did ask for a clarification that

325
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,880
that ended up in one technical change

326
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,480
um that's highlighted in green below

327
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,120
i think the really only open

328
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,720
substantive question is how many

329
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,240
documents

330
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,480
um from my view

331
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,360
you know we had that that history of

332
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,720
um

333
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,240
of splitting things apart and that's

334
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,600
if you want to go into more of that

335
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
there's a couple more slides on it you

336
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
know that those changes date back

337
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,799
literally 10 ietfs maybe 12 ietfs ago so

338
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,559
that was a lot ancient history sort of

339
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,720
doesn't matter what the asian history is

340
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,840
um

341
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,080
the key things i think are we are where

342
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,039
we are

343
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,960
number one number two

344
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,600
um there was a rationale for the split

345
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
meaning referencing documents with

346
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,799
explicit

347
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,120
with unambiguous conformance

348
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,320
um and i you know to me that seemed

349
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,600
reasonable at the time i wasn't um

350
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,960
uh adamant then either as i am not now

351
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,520
uh you know i'm i think i think it'd go

352
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,600
either way i would say that we're gonna

353
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,280
merge i think we should merge all four

354
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
and put it in a single document

355
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,320
um

356
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,280
and

357
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,080
uh

358
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,760
i i think also um keeping them apart

359
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,559
uh has some good rationale to it uh i'll

360
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,919
flip through the next two slides just

361
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,520
because they're really old and they have

362
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
been presented and they provide some

363
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,360
additional context uh and then leave it

364
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,760
to the room to discuss

365
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,240
next please

366
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,440
um yeah i don't think there are any more

367
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,039
slides because the ones that you sent me

368
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,320
yeah that's it so that's why

369
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,360
yeah so

370
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
back in um

371
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,120
basically the

372
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,039
the first split happened based on

373
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,200
discussions at ietf 101 then they were

374
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,840
presented at 102 and this talks about

375
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,240
how the documents were moved apart

376
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,200
um

377
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,960
and it's still referencing basically the

378
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,400
same set of documents and the same

379
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
technologies there's there has been some

380
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
cleanup since then but nothing too

381
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,520
substantive

382
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,880
uh next

383
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
and then at 102 there was some

384
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,080
additional

385
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,320
discussion about making

386
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,600
about

387
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,480
this

388
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,720
that yielded the structure we have now

389
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,679
um and it was um to make it clear

390
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,000
again from the conformance standpoint

391
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
what you were supporting

392
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,039
um

393
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,919
from a uh implementer standpoint i don't

394
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,440
know i don't care if it's one document

395
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,799
or ten documents as long as they're

396
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,320
linked to each other and these these

397
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,360
have appropriate normative references

398
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,400
um

399
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
that's the background if there's any

400
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
questions i can flip back and forth

401
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,080
between the slides i i really don't

402
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,360
think there's much

403
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
left to the to

404
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,039
to say on the topic

405
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,360
um i think the next slide just says what

406
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,240
do we want to do and um

407
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,320
yeah that's the one i uh removed because

408
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,960
it only set the next steps

409
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,640
sent to the iesg question mark and

410
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,360
well that's the from from my end

411
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,159
you know we need a decision um

412
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,880
these things have been open in uh last

413
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
call for like three years

414
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,919
yes and yes three years and a lot of

415
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,159
chairs and uh

416
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,720
you know it's time to be done with these

417
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,840
um frankly i have resisted doing any new

418
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,080
work in this working group because of

419
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,440
how long it's taken to get these

420
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,799
documents out

421
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,720
um and there were a number of of related

422
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,480
documents that i was planning on on

423
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,720
working on and i just haven't because

424
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,640
what's the point um so i'd like to see

425
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,240
these go forward and then you know we

426
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,039
can revisit new work

427
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,400
yeah

428
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,280
i was going quickly to through the list

429
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,000
of attendants to see if rick taylor was

430
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,679
there but that doesn't seem to be the

431
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,280
case because

432
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,919
i think he was one of the

433
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,159
driving forces so to speak behind the

434
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,400
split

435
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,679
but

436
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,120
as far as i can see he's not

437
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,280
there now

438
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,840
but we can always ask

439
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,679
later so is there anyone else

440
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,919
who has an opinion or comments or

441
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,400
maybe rad can talk about whether he is

442
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,799
opinion

443
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,120
i see him in the room so why not

444
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,919
hi uh how about arizona

445
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,360
i don't care

446
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
um well i do care let me put it another

447
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,679
way uh it doesn't matter to me whether

448
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,400
you progress one or four

449
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,159
um the only thing that will matter when

450
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,159
i get to process them

451
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,080
is as you said lou

452
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,840
uh you know they're properly referenced

453
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,280
back and forth

454
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,240
um you know given this discussion i'll

455
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,200
probably if there are more than one

456
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,039
progress them together right so we're

457
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,320
not

458
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,720
trying to review things in the asg that

459
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,799
depend on something that happened a few

460
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,559
months ago or something like that

461
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,960
so um

462
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,480
from that point of view right it will

463
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,080
end up hopefully

464
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
being that we publish them all at the

465
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,559
same time so from the point of view of

466
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,240
our c publication it's about the same

467
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,159
thing right

468
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,400
i have heard in other working groups you

469
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,240
know similar arguments

470
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
of being able to say

471
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,120
as an implementation i support rc1

472
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,039
or rc2 or

473
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,760
just 3 but not 2 or whatever it is so

474
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,120
that it makes it easier for people to

475
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,720
to put that in their

476
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,679
uh

477
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,520
literature or whatever manuals or

478
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,960
anything

479
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,720
and so other working groups have taken

480
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,840
that

481
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,280
that path

482
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,039
um you know the same thing in those

483
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,200
cases i'd rather if there's related

484
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,159
things to kind of process them together

485
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,640
but so this is not unusual that things

486
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,159
are progressed

487
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,320
uh independent of each other independent

488
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,840
meaning you know different rfcs or

489
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,360
different drafts

490
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,600
that are just related at some point so

491
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
so that's why i started by saying that

492
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,400
to me

493
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,200
as

494
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,799
the ad and having to process this it

495
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,880
doesn't really make a difference

496
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,720
which way you want to do it if in one

497
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,440
package or in in this case four

498
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,400
different uh drafts

499
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,279
i

500
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,360
i i won't even say that i hope that

501
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
helped because it probably didn't

502
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,720
but um yeah

503
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,840
it's up to you guys

504
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,520
yes and um

505
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,600
we had the same discussion one year ago

506
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,080
when we had these three fire related

507
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,000
drafts from henning robert

508
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,559
and we also said uh well they're fairly

509
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,600
short should we merge them or should we

510
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,279
should we keep them separate and was

511
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,760
exactly the same argumentation that

512
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,520
if you keep them separate then

513
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,279
implementers can say well i support this

514
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,320
one but not the other one

515
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,200
so that that is valid

516
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,480
um

517
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,900
my only concern is that

518
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,520
[Music]

519
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,240
if we ignore a strong suggestion from a

520
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,520
tsv area review team

521
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,600
and it has to go back there at some

522
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,559
point some point or two

523
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,840
that uh

524
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,000
yeah that we will be effectively blocked

525
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,159
but

526
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,480
if i can

527
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,720
say something real quick for some reason

528
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,320
i can't get off the cue but since i'm

529
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,000
there anyways

530
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,960
i was going to say that

531
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
this is a strong suggestion by the tsb

532
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,679
reviewer

533
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,400
it is not a blocking position no right

534
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,279
yet so you know we can forward it it's

535
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,480
up to the

536
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,320
maybe the transport ads

537
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,000
to decide whether they block or

538
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,880
not

539
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,400
i

540
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,640
can't speak for them but i would doubt

541
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,720
that if we progress all documents at the

542
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,159
same time

543
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,120
and we explain why we're doing this that

544
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,880
you know they would

545
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
want to block anything

546
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320
because you know by that point by the

547
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
time we get to the asg and it's time for

548
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,360
them to

549
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,039
to put their ballots in

550
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,880
um they're going to block on that now we

551
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,400
have to go back right

552
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,159
merge everything go through atf last

553
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,000
call you know everything else and

554
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,520
it's just going to delay something for

555
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,679
the same text right and and maybe

556
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,679
confusion to implementers or people in

557
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,880
the field

558
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,080
so

559
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,520
sure you know it's nice to listen to the

560
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,720
to the reviewers but you know this

561
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,279
doesn't sound like a technical

562
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,720
argument right that he's saying that

563
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,400
something is wrong

564
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,320
it sounds like yeah you know we could do

565
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,640
this in one document which we could

566
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,039
but again it's up to to what you guys

567
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,000
who know the market and the

568
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,520
implementations

569
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,240
uh think is better for this work

570
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,480
and i agree with lou right uh

571
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,000
whatever we decide we should just move

572
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,400
this along and get over with get going

573
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,440
yes

574
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,799
blue

575
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,080
you want to say something yeah i mean

576
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,600
based on all the discussion uh i i

577
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,919
would prefer to keep them separate

578
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,200
and

579
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
not only because it's less work for me

580
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,200
which is always a nice thing um but we

581
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,799
can take the versions we have right now

582
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,240
and submit them

583
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,760
uh you know all the other comments have

584
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,600
been addressed and

585
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,919
uh the documents have been updated you

586
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,720
know at the same level uh i think i

587
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,159
think they're ready to hit submit at

588
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,919
this point um it would be good to get

589
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,840
david to confirm that his other comments

590
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,039
are addressed

591
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,840
uh

592
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,959
and and then go

593
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,159
are you

594
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,640
are we waiting on

595
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,799
further feedback from david

596
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,279
i think it's always good form to circle

597
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,440
back to a reviewer and and confirm with

598
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,760
them that their comments are addressed

599
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,120
okay

600
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
um you know i would say like send them a

601
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
message and say hey can you confirm and

602
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,039
if you know give him a month

603
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
you know some reasonable period of time

604
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,240
to respond

605
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,799
yeah he's been waiting for us

606
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,640
for me maybe

607
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,840
for a very long time so uh

608
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,279
yeah but we shouldn't wait a very long

609
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,520
time forgotten about this

610
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,880
we shouldn't wait a very long time and

611
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,240
keep in mind that this is just getting

612
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,440
into the isg there's still uh ietf last

613
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,360
call there's still the

614
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,080
formal approvals by the area directors

615
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,240
he'll have plenty of time to speak up

616
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,480
if he disagrees

617
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,240
yeah or plenty of opportunity i

618
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,440
shouldn't say time

619
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,799
unfortunately will be plenty of time but

620
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,760
i've had plenty of opportunity

621
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,000
so my takeaway for now is that

622
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,640
we keep those documents separate and i

623
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,039
will send a new mail to the

624
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,679
mailing list

625
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:58,880
to

626
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,399
ask there

627
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,520
this is our uh intended decision

628
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,440
and uh give people uh

629
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,679
a week or two maybe uh maybe

630
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,200
what why do we even need to ask i mean

631
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,440
this the working group previously has

632
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,799
you know for years have said keep it

633
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,760
this way

634
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,200
you know why do we need to go back to

635
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,399
the working group and say yeah we're

636
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,159
really going to keep it this way

637
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,039
we've already said we're sorry

638
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
sorry it was you that said that we

639
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,679
should defer to the working group so

640
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,960
that's not the same as asking the

641
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,399
question again i don't think we need to

642
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,000
ask the question again i think you know

643
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,640
asking uh david if he has any comments

644
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,360
uh i think that you know does this the

645
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,799
current version stress all's comments i

646
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,880
think that's good uh alvaro said

647
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,720
progressive as a set i think that's good

648
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,799
but you know we don't have to have

649
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,559
unless someone else

650
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,240
raises this uh

651
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,080
we've asked and answered this so many

652
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,679
times in the working group i'm not sure

653
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,880
it helps to ask again

654
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
but i'll i i guess i'll defer to the

655
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,200
chair uh i'll defer to the chair so

656
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,080
whatever you want to run it

657
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,000
yeah

658
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,320
okay

659
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,640
um opposed to the list won't hurt

660
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,240
and if if there's no no response

661
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,480
then we

662
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,880
progress as we just

663
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,120
agreed

664
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,840
and um

665
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,399
i'll get back to dave black

666
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,120
to see if he's happy with

667
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,799
the way you resolved all his other

668
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,720
comments

669
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,080
does that sound like a way forward

670
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,799
silence is uh

671
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,440
sounds good to me

672
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,960
yeah sorry i didn't realize you were

673
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,919
just looking for specific thank you okay

674
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,399
thanks lou

675
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,720
moving on

676
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,679
to

677
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,039
agenda item number three

678
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,840
um

679
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,320
the three fire related drafts from

680
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,520
henningeroga are also

681
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,480
a year old now

682
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,279
there has been some discussion on the

683
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,360
mailing list but not

684
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
much

685
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
so we're really keeping another author

686
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,399
waiting

687
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,000
this should not become a tradition

688
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,320
but i play myself let me say that

689
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,760
it seemed to me

690
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,720
that

691
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,559
there was

692
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,120
a discussion on the

693
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,760
channel busy stuff a bit more than the

694
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,240
other ones

695
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,000
because

696
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,120
there

697
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,519
the drafts proposed to send a lot of

698
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,080
parameters to the router by the monum

699
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,679
and let the router sort out what to do

700
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,600
with with those

701
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,360
through some magic

702
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,600
uh formula

703
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,360
but this radio band thing seems to be

704
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,600
the least contentions at least for my

705
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,320
personal uh

706
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,240
observation

707
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,279
so i thought that we could put this one

708
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,519
in working group or in group adoption

709
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,440
call

710
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,760
even if it's not perfect in its current

711
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,120
form

712
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,320
and i recently raised a question about

713
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,519
what to do if your radio or

714
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,960
the modem that's attached

715
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,399
[Music]

716
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,919
if the modem is attached to a radio

717
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,320
that's uh of the frequency hopping kind

718
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,679
how you can then meaningfully

719
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,360
have a

720
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,480
single value for the frequency

721
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,720
in

722
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,880
the data item

723
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,640
and henninger has responded

724
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,360
there's been a reaction for from former

725
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,320
chair justin dean

726
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,640
i responded this morning so the

727
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,340
discussion is

728
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,880
[Music]

729
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,799
is going which is good but that should

730
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,760
not stop this draft from being uh

731
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,799
adopted as a working group document

732
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,279
as far as i'm concerned because

733
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,799
that's only that's not the end of the

734
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,640
process and not the end of discussion

735
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,880
but really the beginning of it

736
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,480
it's it's nothing working group last

737
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,320
call don you wanted to say something

738
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,120
yeah i just had a question of um why

739
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,440
it was it was just uh but this this

740
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,880
draft like uh knitting has three drafts

741
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,919
and

742
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,799
it seems to me that the frequency mine

743
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,679
is probably related to the quality

744
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,600
that you know in uh quality aspects um

745
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,679
the the discussion as i've been reading

746
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,519
it seems to be that if you're doing

747
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,440
frequency hopping it might have some

748
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
other effect on it but you're really not

749
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,679
going to get a good feel for

750
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,480
what the actual capability of frequency

751
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,279
hopping is other than it can do it

752
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,640
so i thought maybe

753
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,679
addressing all three

754
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,279
might might make sense and i just

755
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,640
wondered why we were just doing the one

756
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,919
ah

757
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,439
fair point

758
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,200
um

759
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,840
my idea was

760
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,080
what i proposed was to

761
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,820
for the frequency hopping

762
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,279
[Music]

763
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,440
just have a flag in the data item that

764
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,840
said

765
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,640
whether the

766
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,799
the frequency hopping

767
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,960
field had a meaningful value

768
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,720
so if the

769
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
the frequency field had a meaningful

770
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,480
value so if the radio

771
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,960
was of the frequency hopping kind then

772
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,760
you would just lower this flag and say

773
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,399
okay i can still report the bandwidth

774
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,918
but i don't

775
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,159
have a sensible value for the frequency

776
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,000
opening joe just ignored it

777
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,918
is is the band with this reported is

778
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,000
that a data bandwidth or is that a um

779
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,719
a frequency bandwidth

780
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,679
i

781
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,679
that that's a bandwidth in hertz

782
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,079
so how much of the spectrum is is this

783
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,960
signal uh

784
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,918
occupying

785
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,078
so that you can so the router can

786
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,159
decide to use a less

787
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,399
bandwidth consuming

788
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,680
alternative

789
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,319
if there is one

790
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,640
yeah i i just thought the the use of

791
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,320
bandwidth sorry

792
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,520
go ahead

793
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,839
now that that's the way that

794
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,040
this this

795
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,280
router would factor this information

796
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,400
into its

797
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,079
into its routing decision that was the

798
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,520
idea as far as i understood

799
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,320
yeah when i saw that in the draft i i

800
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,480
i'm used to bandwidth being a data

801
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,119
bandwidth of bits per second

802
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,720
and

803
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,880
we might want to use a different term or

804
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,359
make sure that we point that out that

805
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,520
you know

806
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,040
i think the thing in hertz is the

807
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,640
original meaning of bandwidth and

808
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,599
yeah i stay this guy because we wrecked

809
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,839
it

810
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,520
um i call that capacity by the way

811
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,079
um

812
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,000
so yeah we have this adoption call

813
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,240
running until friday

814
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,680
but you do have a point why not the

815
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,078
other two

816
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,200
so maybe i'll just

817
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,400
issue

818
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,839
adoption calls for

819
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,960
those as well

820
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,320
if only to get some more discussion

821
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,960
that would be good

822
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,720
so far however

823
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,560
i think the discussion on the radio band

824
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,760
thing

825
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,119
is not

826
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,839
overwhelming

827
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,359
so

828
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,960
this is a

829
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,200
another encouragement to the working

830
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,598
group to

831
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,119
the working group members to state their

832
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,160
opinions

833
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,640
or ask questions or provide comments as

834
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,200
some have been doing but

835
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,720
i hope there are more people out there

836
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,040
that

837
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,760
can

838
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,560
chime in on this

839
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,350
okay

840
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,000
[Music]

841
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,960
the future works slide

842
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,000
did not really change since last time we

843
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,839
had a presentation last time by ed

844
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,119
bahrain

845
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,960
from the uh chair of the dtn working

846
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,400
group on

847
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,240
what is now called

848
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,480
dtn network

849
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,280
management with what used to be called

850
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,280
asynchronous management architecture

851
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,560
there were a few questions at the end of

852
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,960
the presentation but not a whole lot

853
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,760
i'm planning to attend the dtn meeting

854
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,839
tomorrow and see

855
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,440
where they are with that and maybe have

856
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,960
a chat with people

857
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,359
to the extent that they are present here

858
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,839
afterwards

859
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
for as far as multi-cost is concerned we

860
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,920
still have this

861
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,920
question

862
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,160
of whether is worth pursuing

863
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,839
i think it is but in a slightly

864
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,200
different context namely as part of a

865
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,640
federation

866
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,440
of

867
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,800
monet's

868
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,200
sort of

869
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,839
new topic

870
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,520
there are some

871
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
near future issues

872
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,320
the ola rv2 router restart

873
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,040
recommendations

874
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,400
were prompted by a problem that was

875
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,560
found last year

876
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,400
during

877
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,240
a major interoperability testing event

878
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,280
yeah

879
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,640
i will

880
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,640
get in touch with hanning roha to

881
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,240
because it was with his implementation

882
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,920
osr d2 that we

883
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,760
ran into this

884
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,880
i will

885
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,280
ask him

886
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
if he has worked on a solution in the

887
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
meantime

888
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,010
it was

889
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,680
[Music]

890
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,480
also one year ago at the

891
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,839
march meeting

892
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,839
a presentation by

893
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,720
jointly by rick taylor and lou berger on

894
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,640
a d-lab clarifications and lessons

895
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,760
learned internet draft that they both

896
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,720
thought would be useful to have

897
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,720
however since they have indicated that

898
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,480
neither of them has time to work on it

899
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,599
lou can you confirm that it's still the

900
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,560
case

901
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,400
i may have time once the other drafts

902
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,560
get submitted to the isg

903
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,000
uh okay

904
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,040
yeah

905
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,520
i uh i understand

906
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,240
yeah i i i'm not gonna yeah

907
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,960
yeah

908
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,640
sure i'll revisit that once they're

909
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,079
submitted thank you

910
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,240
yeah

911
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,118
i can see your point

912
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,599
just for good measure i'll ask rick the

913
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,839
same question

914
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,200
then um

915
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,720
question

916
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,440
to

917
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,240
avro but not on his capacity as ad but

918
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,040
as someone who may be involved in this

919
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,359
inter-satellite link

920
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,800
thing

921
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,640
do you think there's any role for the

922
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,319
monet working group

923
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,359
with regard to that

924
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,040
alvaro thana feature way technologies

925
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,720
um

926
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,359
so yes i'm authoring a couple of drafts

927
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,040
on uh routing over isl

928
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,560
we presented them at a couple of

929
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,520
different working groups and

930
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,920
we are

931
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,800
my company working with a specific

932
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,119
provider who has

933
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,599
or is

934
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,839
who has deployed their own constellation

935
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,280
etc now the thing that

936
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,440
some people have asked us here the atf

937
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,599
is

938
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,040
well if we're going to standardize

939
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,680
something we need

940
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,839
interoperability

941
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,440
and it would be great if we had other

942
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,480
participants

943
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,960
um you know wanting to to do this

944
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,079
um

945
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,040
so yes on one hand i think that

946
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
um you know things are moving you know

947
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,359
it's an uh type network so it sort of

948
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,319
fits

949
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,720
on the other hand uh i would really like

950
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,319
to see

951
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,520
um

952
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,040
you know other people in the space

953
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,160
interested

954
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,839
right if not i don't think it makes

955
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,839
sense for for the one person or the one

956
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:44,880
company

957
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,839
to

958
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,280
to uh you have to push some work right

959
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,839
even if others might want help right so

960
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,359
so i would rather

961
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,359
see that interest first

962
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,599
before having something

963
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,200
um yo listen here clear

964
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,520
um i let

965
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,680
oh yeah go ahead yeah uh the ambergram

966
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,640
which

967
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,760
so

968
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,440
i believe this you're referring the

969
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,760
presentation that was done this morning

970
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,880
in the distributed mobility

971
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,560
yeah and i want to make that comment

972
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,319
there so first of all if that would be

973
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,000
discussed i think

974
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
man it would be a much better working

975
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,119
group

976
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,880
for that then

977
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,119
then that would been in the distributed

978
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,040
mobility management

979
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,240
and as this is about semantic crowding

980
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,160
and there is some interest within the

981
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,240
community to work on the semantic

982
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,000
routing by this i'm referring to the

983
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,640
work by adrian farrell and daniel king

984
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,800
it might be worth to see

985
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,480
what they are doing on

986
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,560
general semantic routing and then you

987
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,680
can add the use cases for the

988
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,079
inter inter satellite links because you

989
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,160
you just want to add some semantics to

990
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,920
the routing

991
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,119
thank you

992
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,400
right so just a quick clarification

993
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,560
alvaro retina future way

994
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,880
again uh yes so there are yeah this is a

995
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,000
big system right so there are many

996
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,200
different parts

997
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,960
in there and that's why we've been

998
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,640
talking to different working groups so

999
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,720
there's all the the mobility and handoff

1000
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,200
management stuff so yeah that's why dmm

1001
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
there's a bunch of routing right in

1002
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,880
between all the links

1003
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,760
um there's how do we actually do some of

1004
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,800
the directions through the network

1005
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,560
which is where we're putting or looking

1006
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,359
at

1007
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,599
putting some semantics in the addresses

1008
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,200
so that it's not just

1009
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,880
go to address five

1010
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,599
but inside the orbit go left to right

1011
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,599
and the orbit go yeah

1012
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,880
et cetera

1013
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,240
i think that

1014
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,920
that um

1015
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,920
given that it's a big problem

1016
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,680
it probably doesn't

1017
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,480
fit

1018
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,000
in one place

1019
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,599
and even if we

1020
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,920
do one thing in one place for example

1021
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
routing here right

1022
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,680
i think the forwarding

1023
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,160
using say semantic addresses

1024
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
yeah it's sort of independent somehow

1025
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,920
right we can still do forwarding

1026
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,079
in different ways

1027
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,440
or we can do them with the semantic

1028
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,880
thing right so in other words i don't

1029
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,520
want to also wait for

1030
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,560
um

1031
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,319
other working groups and research groups

1032
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,359
to figure out what to do with this

1033
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,280
amazing growing stuff

1034
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,319
before

1035
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,400
doing something if again if there's

1036
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,079
enough interest

1037
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,760
to do it

1038
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,880
at least

1039
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,960
there's some interest uh or i guess

1040
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
there's some interest uh so so it would

1041
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,599
be uh important to see

1042
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,520
what else and how would we scope that

1043
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,280
work say here

1044
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,119
or somewhere else right yeah

1045
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,960
so as the monkey grounding is looking

1046
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,800
for some real use cases and they're

1047
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,119
coming up with this a real use case and

1048
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,520
the real problem that industry has to

1049
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,520
solve is trying to solve so there's

1050
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,359
reason why i'm saying joining forces by

1051
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,839
bringing a real use case that is a

1052
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,920
problem today could speed up with the

1053
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,119
work because there would be more

1054
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,359
interest by the larger number of

1055
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,319
community okay

1056
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,480
blue

1057
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,319
so i think we've had um

1058
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,240
satellite presentations in multiple

1059
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,839
working groups um in different areas uh

1060
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,800
speaking to alvaro as a.d it might be

1061
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,560
worthwhile to have a single place at

1062
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,160
least the route for the routing issues

1063
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,040
to be

1064
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,240
um

1065
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,640
housed so that we know where to go for

1066
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,920
the discussions and their single

1067
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,440
discussions as opposed to fragmented

1068
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,560
discussions

1069
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,880
um and whether it's semantic routing um

1070
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,960
elements show up or not i think that's

1071
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,200
uh you know a more detailed comment than

1072
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,040
what i'm making uh you know that's both

1073
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,920
uh

1074
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,440
that's secondary

1075
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,839
um but it would be a good good to have a

1076
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,599
single place for it man a seems to be a

1077
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,839
great candidate um not a lot of activity

1078
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,680
here that you know so there's probably

1079
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,240
space for it but then again you often

1080
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,480
get more activity in a new working group

1081
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,839
so i would be interested in hearing from

1082
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,319
uh alvaro if the isg has been talking

1083
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,640
about potentially where to house this

1084
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,118
activity

1085
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,000
um

1086
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,720
hi again uh

1087
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,480
um

1088
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,480
no we haven't specifically been talking

1089
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,720
about this uh work on on

1090
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,520
routing and satellites

1091
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,040
we have

1092
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,520
uh well me obviously but others

1093
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,480
noticed that there have been

1094
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,040
representations the other places

1095
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,000
um so just to be clear i'm going to

1096
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,160
hand this off to one of the other

1097
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,000
routing ads right since i have an

1098
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,440
obvious conflict

1099
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,960
uh on

1100
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,560
talking especially with the entities

1101
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,079
because of dmm and you know has been

1102
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,720
presented i think in int area as well

1103
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,160
to figure out you know what do we do

1104
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,240
with this if anything as i said before

1105
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,400
one of my concerns even if i'm one of

1106
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,680
the authors there

1107
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,920
is that

1108
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,359
i think it's an interesting topic and i

1109
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,480
think many of us would say it's an

1110
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,760
interesting topic even if we were not

1111
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,040
working on it

1112
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,079
i would again like to see more

1113
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,160
actual people working on constellations

1114
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,079
or trying to provide service over

1115
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,760
satellite networks

1116
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,280
uh to you know come forward and be

1117
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,200
interested in doing some of the work

1118
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,720
uh you know otherwise

1119
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,200
um it will

1120
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,040
it won't be as as fruitful or as

1121
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,119
impactful work for the atf

1122
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,760
in the end but yes i'll carry this to

1123
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,680
john or andrew to

1124
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,319
to talk about

1125
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,960
whether there is they think there is

1126
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,240
enough

1127
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,960
interest and and to figure out what to

1128
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,839
do with this at some point

1129
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,119
there will also be

1130
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,000
a short presentation on this in the next

1131
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
slot in rtgwg

1132
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,440
so i'll also talk to the chairs there

1133
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,680
because our twg is chartered to try and

1134
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,280
dispatch some things

1135
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,040
so that they

1136
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,240
you know try and think about that as

1137
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,479
well

1138
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,559
thank you

1139
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,240
i have to say that

1140
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,480
i am on the inter area i'm mailing east

1141
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,319
and i see all this uh

1142
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,359
post on semantic uh routing uh fly by

1143
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,520
but uh i haven't really had the time to

1144
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,400
uh

1145
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,880
to digest all that but uh

1146
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,800
oh so sorry so now that you said that it

1147
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,640
reminded me of something else

1148
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,960
um

1149
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,400
so as i tried to say before you know

1150
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,079
this writing over satellites right is

1151
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,359
trying to use some semantic addressing

1152
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:28,960
to do the forwarding

1153
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,319
uh but

1154
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,760
you know it is not just semantic

1155
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,119
addressing right and we don't depend on

1156
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,440
that there has been to answer another

1157
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,119
part of this question

1158
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,839
a little bit more discussion in the asg

1159
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,559
and i'm sure you guys have seen it

1160
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,960
in the irtf as well especially in the

1161
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,480
pointer g working

1162
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,440
research group about semantic routing in

1163
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,440
general

1164
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,040
so um

1165
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,160
yes we have talked a little bit more

1166
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,480
about that because

1167
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,720
the general response from the irtf seems

1168
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,079
to be more

1169
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,880
along the lines of this may be

1170
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,400
engineering work

1171
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,599
not a research topic

1172
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,000
and of course in

1173
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,920
the atf we still haven't seen

1174
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,920
specific proposals for use cases

1175
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
maybe this is the first one right

1176
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,000
uh again trying to deconflict myself as

1177
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,160
much as possible uh so we've been you

1178
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,839
know looking at that as well you know if

1179
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,319
there is a specific

1180
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,240
proposal

1181
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,640
for what work do should we do

1182
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,920
uh then you know it's something we then

1183
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,440
we can consider you know do we charter a

1184
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,680
new working group do we do this do we do

1185
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,960
a mainly less you know whatever the the

1186
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,079
options are

1187
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,640
um again if you're interested uh towards

1188
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,800
the end of

1189
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,440
rtdwg in the next hour

1190
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,559
we're gonna have a discussion on that

1191
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,960
hopefully we get to it because it's in

1192
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,400
the last couple of

1193
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,760
10 20 minutes

1194
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,760
so we might run out of time but that's

1195
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,559
some of what we're going to be

1196
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,480
discussing okay there as well

1197
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,040
so on the

1198
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,440
semantic routing there are there are

1199
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
issues for use cases but

1200
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,280
the more and more

1201
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,839
i start to look into

1202
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:14,640
the

1203
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,640
edge applications i had that

1204
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,319
word but

1205
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,680
you know it's sort of like marketing

1206
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,319
words that covers a lot of area

1207
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,559
i see there's a lot of need for semantic

1208
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,559
routing in industrial process

1209
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,040
applications that are being executed at

1210
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,000
the edge

1211
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,520
so having

1212
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,200
more use cases

1213
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,720
we can then have a better foundation for

1214
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,800
the semantic routing where we can take

1215
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,559
multiple aspects

1216
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,880
what are the requirements and and

1217
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,200
develop the right solution instead of

1218
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,119
just going from one angle

1219
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,240
and uh ended up being a one specialized

1220
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,599
and then we see oh we need something

1221
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,599
else and then we end up another version

1222
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,720
of

1223
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,559
solution for pretty much the same

1224
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,800
problem hence i would like to see that

1225
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,559
you know me personally i would like to

1226
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,839
see that

1227
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,319
joint work because who knows what

1228
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,400
different errors will run into it and

1229
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,240
the more input we have i think we can

1230
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,960
then develop a better solution

1231
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,800
makes sense lou are you still in the

1232
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,640
queue or did you want to add something

1233
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,720
ah that's clear

1234
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:24,160
right so

1235
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,000
we have a couple of minutes left

1236
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,200
so

1237
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,720
i would like to say and now for

1238
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,839
something completely different

1239
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,520
i

1240
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,119
this is about

1241
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,680
protocols that were

1242
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,119
developed

1243
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,720
in this working group in the past

1244
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,359
notably

1245
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,920
simplified multicast forwarding

1246
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,119
which is a way to disseminate

1247
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,760
multi-cost information in an efficient

1248
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,680
manner throughout

1249
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,680
mna

1250
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,160
or the federation of manaes

1251
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,558
probably

1252
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,640
and

1253
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,119
there are several

1254
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,079
ways

1255
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,079
this is described in rfc 6621 by the way

1256
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,520
which is an experimental document from

1257
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,160
2012.

1258
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,078
never

1259
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,359
brought further

1260
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,800
to standards track

1261
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,559
however i know that the original authors

1262
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:37,440
from

1263
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,640
the naval research laboratory in the us

1264
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,680
have been doing a lot of work since

1265
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,720
and

1266
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,960
hopefully we can one day persuade them

1267
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,760
to bring some of that work here

1268
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,440
but in the meantime we have smf

1269
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,720
and it has a number of

1270
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,160
what are called

1271
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,040
relay set reduction mechanisms

1272
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,680
those are three of them are

1273
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,960
described in appendices to rfc

1274
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,440
6621

1275
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,280
one of them is called

1276
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,880
source-based multi-point relay

1277
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,800
and this is the one that can use the

1278
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,800
information from a unicast routing

1279
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,960
protocol

1280
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,000
optimized link state routing v2

1281
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,119
described in rfc 7181

1282
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:30,640
to

1283
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,400
effectively use the

1284
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,359
graph

1285
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,800
yeah graph

1286
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,359
that that protocol uses to disseminate

1287
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:45,119
its policy control information

1288
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,160
leverage that

1289
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,000
to also

1290
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,960
use

1291
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,960
general user type

1292
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,920
user

1293
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,200
multicast

1294
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,520
package

1295
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,440
however when it comes to implementations

1296
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,000
there is an implementation out there

1297
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,119
for ola's rfe2 which is called osr d2

1298
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,079
it's done by henning robe

1299
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,359
and there is nrl smf from

1300
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,880
the naval research lab

1301
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,520
olazar

1302
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,040
d2 has the information that

1303
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,640
nrl smf needs to do this this smpr

1304
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,920
mechanism

1305
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,280
however in an incompatible format

1306
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,839
so a little thingy that i worked on and

1307
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,599
it's really very simple

1308
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,440
it's a

1309
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,240
write a sort of conversion program that

1310
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,359
ties the two together

1311
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,760
i want to open source this

1312
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,160
i don't know how many hurdles there are

1313
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,119
in my

1314
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,359
organization but

1315
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,119
if i explain how it works then it's so

1316
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,400
simple that you can always do it

1317
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,520
yourself in

1318
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,319
a couple of hours

1319
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,559
well maybe this is a bit

1320
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,280
small but

1321
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,680
basically says what i just

1322
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,160
said here

1323
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,119
ola's rv2

1324
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,680
selects multi-point

1325
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,839
relays based on neighbor information

1326
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,359
that it gets

1327
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,760
in such a way that covers all its two

1328
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,480
hope neighbors

1329
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,599
smf can leverage this information for

1330
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,200
the smpr

1331
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,759
mechanism

1332
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,240
and

1333
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,720
if we go to implementations there's this

1334
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,680
osr d2 and there's no smf and what we

1335
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,599
need is a bit of glue

1336
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,480
to tie them together

1337
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,680
which is what this is

1338
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,599
um

1339
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,359
also too has a telnet interface

1340
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,400
um

1341
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,799
you can talk to it

1342
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,960
over tcp socket

1343
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,680
find the loopback interface

1344
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,599
and now smf on the other end has a

1345
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,839
unique socket where it expects its input

1346
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,200
both sent their

1347
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,280
regular

1348
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,880
information

1349
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,040
so in the case of ozard2

1350
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,480
these are the osr v2

1351
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,960
routing packets

1352
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,640
containing hellos and tc messages

1353
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,839
and

1354
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,400
in case of analyzer mf this is the

1355
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,240
the actual

1356
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,559
user traffic

1357
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,799
that doesn't even even have to be

1358
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,680
maybe of course

1359
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,079
yeah

1360
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,200
that's not

1361
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,480
forget the udp socket thing on the right

1362
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,000
side that was my mistake

1363
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,460
but

1364
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,319
[Music]

1365
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,680
the

1366
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,040
thing in the middle is called the duff

1367
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,200
and because

1368
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,680
o32 is from germany and nrl smf is

1369
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,280
from the usa

1370
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,799
duff stands for

1371
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,960
deutsche american franchise

1372
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,680
or german american friendship

1373
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,680
which also happens to be in the name of

1374
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,640
a german band from the 1980s

1375
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:30,240
um this dove thing is continually

1376
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,240
querying osr d2 for

1377
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,319
neighbor information

1378
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,240
specifically

1379
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,079
who are your

1380
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,920
symmetric

1381
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,079
neighbors one of neighbors

1382
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,200
and

1383
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,599
which of those have selected you as an

1384
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,240
npr so who are your npr selectors

1385
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,240
this is exactly the information that nrl

1386
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,439
smf needs

1387
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,319
and so

1388
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,160
but the formats are a bit different so

1389
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,520
dof converts the answers that it gets

1390
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,559
from mozart d2 and sends them in the in

1391
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,359
the format that the nrl smf can digest

1392
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,920
to enroll

1393
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,240
and

1394
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,079
while it's doing that it's also logging

1395
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,319
all the information that gets from osrd2

1396
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:26,079
so afterwards you have a nice trace

1397
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,000
over the whole run that over the whole

1398
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,760
period of your

1399
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,280
let's say experiment or test

1400
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:36,720
of

1401
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,400
which

1402
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,400
which nodes were one of neighbors and

1403
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,960
npr selectors at which point in time

1404
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,960
and there's a little snippet here from a

1405
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,599
window that shows the source mac address

1406
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,160
of neighbor

1407
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,079
whether or not it's an npr selector of

1408
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,920
yours

1409
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,079
and

1410
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,799
whether or not the

1411
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,640
neighbor status is symmetric

1412
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,640
and that's really all

1413
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,920
and we're almost out of time

1414
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,720
so

1415
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,880
thank you for attending whether in

1416
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,119
person or remotely

1417
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,200
um

1418
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,119
we have to see whether we will have a

1419
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,440
meeting

1420
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,960
in philadelphia

1421
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,720
but i hope we do

1422
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,959
and

1423
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,799
see you

1424
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,200
there if not before on the mailing list

1425

and don't forget to

1426
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,640

1427
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,359
the

1428
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,440
adoption of the drafts of having robin

1429
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,680
