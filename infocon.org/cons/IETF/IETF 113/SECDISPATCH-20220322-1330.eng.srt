1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,440
it was choppy for me before initially

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,480
testing one two three testing

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,679
that's better

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,920
that works for me much better

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,599
didn't change anything maybe the network

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,560
just cleared up

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,240
i think there might be issues when

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,600
there's people in the room that forget

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,840
that their video turns on whenever a new

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,920
person joins so if someone

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
joins with their video on everybody in

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,599
the room suddenly gets more video if

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,920
they're using the full client

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,520
which is why it's better to not use the

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
full client when you're in this room and

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,719
to actually use the light client

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
but if you do use the full client please

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,960
be sure to regularly check that you're

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
not taking a video stream in

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,120
okay and so richard what did you say

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,800
your plan was with mohit because you

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
hadn't communicated it to me and i got

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,440
all the materials ready so i just no no

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,680
i i should yeah i mean feel free to

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,480
drive

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,320
feel free to drive if you like uh mohit

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,920
and i just talked in the back channel

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
like just now um

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
he had he had asked me to drive um but

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,080
i'm also happy to have you drive since

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,600
uh you digital

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,520
i'm happy to not drive

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
nope i did all the material creation so

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,360
i'm i'm happy for one of you to drive if

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,759
you'd like

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,640
um

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
maybe i'll wait

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,280
yep we're deciding on the fly so no no

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,080
problem

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,280
uh not not being aware

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640
so i think we're at time

42
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,840
[Music]

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,680
yeah let's see maybe you could dress

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
through the in here life was audio um

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,479
because apparently i'm bad

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
all right so we are at time um

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,920
so uh paul and peter yee will take

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,360
minutes

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,640
um using the tool

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,000
and it looks like paul you're also

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,920
driving slides so here is the notewow

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,079
welcome to sec dispatch if you're in the

53
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,840
wrong place go to the right place

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
please note the notewell and then the

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,000
sec dispatch process the ground rules

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,560
so sec dispatch recommends next step for

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
new work

58
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
and it's really the ads that can make

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
that final decision along with the

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,040
community

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,840
sec dispatch does not itself adopt

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,879
drafts

63
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,720
and some of the possible outcomes

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
include direct to an existing working

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,800
group propose a new focused working

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,760
group

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,519
ad sponsorship if an ad is willing

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,280
additional discussion or community

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,120
development required

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,440
or the ietf should not work on a

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
particular topic

72
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,560
so next slide please

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,800
all right and so now agenda bashing we

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,879
have the agenda on two slides

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,640
so we will begin with what i thought

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,480
would be the shorter drafts the ones

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,920
that will get through the the quickest

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,040
so they may not take a full 15 minutes i

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,280
expect they'd be rather fast so

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,000
cypher suites iana ssh

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
protocol parameters

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,599
and next slide just for agenda bashing

83
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,959
thank you

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,239
encrypted

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,360
client hello deployment considerations

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,720
uh that one

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,560
might be more discussion and

88
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
architecture for trustworthy and

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,640
transparent digital supply chain that

90
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,879
could also be a bit more of a discussion

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,440
and then key consistency and discovery

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,000
any agenda bashing okay so we have

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,519
christopher wood in the queue

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
um yeah kathleen as i said over email

95
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,840
this uh the last

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,680
item was added to the agenda quite late

97
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,200
so i'm no longer able to do the

98
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,560
presentation

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,879
okay

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,839
all right thank you

101
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,879
all right so if that's it

102
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
we will begin with the first

103
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,119
presentation

104
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,799
thanks paul

105
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,360
i'll go on mute

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,720
then we have a speaker in the room great

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,320
hello

108
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,560
uh this is joe salloway i'm presenting

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,320
this uh draft on uh secure i mean

110
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,639
updating the cypher suites in secure

111
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,759
syslog

112
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,240
uh along with uh chris lombic and uh

113
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,479
sean turner uh next slide please

114
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
okay

115
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,680
um it turns out that uh iec working

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
group

117
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,320
wants to refer to syslog secure syslog

118
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,400
but unfortunately the draft is pinned to

119
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,639
tls 1.2

120
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,800
and the mandatory to implement algorithm

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,600
at that time which is tls rsa with aes

122
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,680
128 cdc shot

123
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,400
this algorithm is now deprecated

124
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,360
um

125
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,160
and so we want to fix this problem so

126
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,440
let's go to the next slide

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
what can we do

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,320
um

129
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,919
we don't necessarily have to do anything

130
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,880
the

131
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,840
iec working group can

132
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,320
update uh their documentation to to

133
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,840
reference the new

134
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,479
updated algorithms um

135
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,600
but uh it probably would be better if we

136
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,479
maintain the rfc and uh

137
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,880
updated the syslog

138
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,680
tls and dtls algorithm guidance

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,479
uh in our documents

140
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,039
next slide

141
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,800
um so what do we what changes have we

142
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
made in the

143
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,440
in these uh

144
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,520
drafts um

145
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
first thing just to kind of justif

146
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,520
justify why we made that change

147
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,080
um updated the mandatory to implement to

148
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,520
tls ecdhg rsa with aes 128 gsm sha-256

149
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,280
which is generally accepted as a good

150
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,240
one

151
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,639
um

152
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,960
uh you also said that you're allowed to

153
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,919
use

154
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,720
tls or dtls13

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,520
we we also will need to add some

156
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,840
recommendations on how to handle zero

157
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
rtt in these cases

158
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,960
um

159
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,560
and then uh

160
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,479
we'll have a section that discusses the

161
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,479
changes

162
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,560
next

163
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,479
slide

164
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,919
okay so

165
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,400
how should we take care of this draft

166
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
you know we can bring it to an existing

167
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,759
working group

168
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,400
have a boss 80 sponsor

169
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
independent

170
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,319
roman go submission

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,680
uh hi uh thanks for bringing this to us

172
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,919
joe uh to bring everyone kind of up to

173
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,520
speed on other coordination we've been

174
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,120
doing uh

175
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
welcome kind of all the feedback we're

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
gonna get at the mic line here we did

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,039
check with the ops area to see whether

178
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,160
there's any existing uh existing kind of

179
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,000
work that's really close to this with

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,120
syslog they said no but they did point

181
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
out that

182
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,919
ops wag would potentially accept this so

183
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,599
that's an option

184
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,919
thank you

185
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
eric

186
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,360
um so i think uh not

187
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,479
not both is too small not ise

188
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,120
um it's actually i think we're about not

189
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,360
80 sponsors too big so that probably his

190
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
existing working group um

191
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,240
wg says okay i was gonna suggest uga um

192
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
but um i think those would be okay um i

193
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
i don't think this is quite as true i

194
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,759
mean this looks approximately right but

195
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,800
i think you know probably there would be

196
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,240
a little bit messing around so like

197
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
probably having it like farm down the

198
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,319
road google useful um but i think

199
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,919
um either uh or uh

200
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
okay

201
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,520
so any other

202
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,560
feedback i heard

203
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,000
dispatching it to tls or uta

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
perhaps ad sponsorship is possible

205
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,120
by the ops 80s but

206
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,760
any other feedback from those

207
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
in the room are

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,799
in meat echo

209
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,519
rick

210
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,240
okay it sounds like then we'll uh

211
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,160
discuss with the relevant uh

212
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,240
hold on joe uh there is rich eric yeah

213
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,560
just gonna confirm i think uta is fine i

214
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
mean from this

215
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
syslog's an application right and this

216
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,320
is using tls in an application so

217
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,800
that's all

218
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,920
okay

219
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
richard did you have something

220
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
no i was just gonna

221
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,080
help some up it sounds like uh uta is

222
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
kind of where we're headed with this

223
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,399
excellent i guess then we have

224
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,160
dispatched this tentatively to utf

225
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,279
else find that the uh slides look really

226
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,360
goofy and are cut off

227
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,560
yeah i'm not sure about that

228
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,839
that should say update to the iana ssh

229
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,760
protocol parameters registry

230
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,480
requirements

231
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,439
uh next slide please

232
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:20,720
uh

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,279
this is me taco uh

234
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,440
sharing why me taco do you want

235
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,560
uh

236
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,760
peter for me to share the slides from

237
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,040
from my machine instead uh

238
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,079
yeah that would probably make a little

239
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,359
easier for everybody else to read

240
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
just uh hold on i'll i'll download your

241
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,160
slides locally and and show them

242
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,480
one sec

243
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,120
um

244
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,160
do you see the slides now are

245
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,839
also seeing the interface and the slide

246
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,680
is cut off

247
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,279
just the title is up looked better a

248
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,600
minute ago mohit

249
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,760
yep there you go

250
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,920
excellent

251
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,839
so just let me know peter when to go on

252
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,600
the next slide yeah go ahead to the next

253
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
slide please

254
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,639
all right so

255
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
this draft

256
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,040
is fairly straightforward it updates the

257
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,560
iana secure

258
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
shell protocol parameter registry right

259
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,560
now most of it is

260
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,760
ietf review as the requirement

261
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
this draft would change that to expert

262
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,959
review

263
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,839
and like many other drafts of this type

264
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,600
it establishes an expert reviewers

265
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,880
mailing list

266
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
and gives some guidance around

267
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,839
the expert reviewers

268
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,360
um it does not change anything that

269
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,000
actually requires a standard

270
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,920
to be placed into the registry so this

271
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
is just a bunch of

272
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,720
minor numbers if you will

273
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,200
next slide please

274
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
uh this came up on the curdle mailing

275
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,600
list a bit over a year ago

276
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,240
and given the state of curdle and

277
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,480
no other perhaps obvious place to send

278
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,560
it i'm requesting security ad

279
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
sponsorship but

280
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,079
obviously

281
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,279
i would welcome

282
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,160
other suggestions

283
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,959
that's pretty much it the next slide

284
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,240
just gives you a pointer to the mailing

285
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,480
list entry

286
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,959
yeah hi i wanted to to jump in here uh

287
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,880
we we've talked about it internally kind

288
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
of with the with the sec ads a.d

289
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,519
sponsorship really is the only

290
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,880
the only way to go given that we no

291
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,720
longer have kind of kernel so we'll talk

292
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,639
amongst ourselves to figure out who will

293
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,160
take it but we'll commit to ad

294
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,360
sponsorship

295
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,519
okay great thank you

296
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,360
and it seems like there's support for

297
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,320
that in the in the chat as well so i

298
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,199
will consider that the outcome

299
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
next

300
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,480
uh

301
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,000
who who is up next uh is it client hello

302
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,160
or

303
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,920
yes client hello

304
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,199
excellent

305
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,560
hi everyone uh so this is a

306
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,880
proposal to

307
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,839
basically look at the uh sorry look at

308
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
the ech encrypted client hello

309
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,760
um

310
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,680
standard that's developing the extension

311
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
to the tls

312
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,880
and

313
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
really just give some insight in terms

314
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,040
of the potential impact um on end users

315
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,000
specifically which

316
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,040
as far as we can tell is is is new input

317
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,199
uh into that particular

318
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,639
uh discussion uh i believe paul vixi is

319
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,519
uh also uh attending the meeting one of

320
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,360
my co-authors uh remotely so uh

321
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,839
he'll potentially join in the discussion

322
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,720
as well uh uh our third co-author david

323
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,240
wright uh

324
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,759
isn't with us either in person or

325
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,519
remotely but uh

326
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,880
by the way of his background he works in

327
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,680
the education sector uh in a

328
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,199
looking at some of the security and

329
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,320
privacy issues uh specific to schools

330
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,560
uh in the sector next slide please

331
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
so

332
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
what we've done is to gather input from

333
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,480
a variety

334
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
multiple multiple stakeholders

335
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,279
interestingly so lots of stakeholders

336
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,360
um to really get an understanding of

337
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,519
where and how they see

338
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,240
ech impacting specifically in terms of

339
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,800
loss of visibility of the smi

340
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,600
data which clearly is one of the uh

341
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
intended consequences of

342
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,160
encrypting it

343
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
our view is that by having a sort of a

344
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,279
better

345
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,680
understanding of those impacts that

346
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
will hopefully lead to uh

347
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,959
better solutions um as the

348
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,920
uh standard uh is uh uh developed

349
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,839
hopefully that uh we'll work with

350
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,519
minimal disruption

351
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,480
uh to end users wherever possible

352
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,279
or at least if it's necessary

353
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,160
to

354
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,360
encourage

355
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,680
sort of multi-stakeholder engagement

356
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,000
so that there's awareness before

357
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
the

358
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,199
ech is launched

359
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,800
as well as knowledge of the likely

360
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,920
impacts

361
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,279
on those

362
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,040
different user groups

363
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,319
next slide please

364
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and i should say just responding to a

365
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,199
comment in the sec dispatch uh

366
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,640
mailing list

367
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
in case it wasn't clear

368
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,959
uh the the intent of the of the uh paper

369
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,359
is not to stop uh deployment of ech but

370
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,240
but to provide better understanding in

371
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
how or when it's deployed so if that

372
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,119
wasn't clear in the current draft

373
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,240
apologies

374
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
it's also worth just bear in mind it is

375
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,400
an initial draft

376
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
and we certainly will welcome additional

377
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,640
input from anyone

378
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,400
we have already

379
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,480
uh so requested steps from a number of

380
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,320
interested uh parties that could

381
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,919
potentially provide some additional sort

382
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,280
of data input

383
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,160
to give some quantitative uh

384
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,360
insight to to guide the literally pretty

385
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,919
qualitative qualitative content

386
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
um so far

387
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,880
um

388
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,799
just some other observations just to

389
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,160
call those out uh rfc 7258

390
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,640
does highlight the the need to protect

391
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,960
uh sort of users privacy

392
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,960
but so also notes that uh

393
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,000
it's

394
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,640
not acceptable to in doing that to make

395
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
networks unmanageable um and that's

396
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,120
saying which which we think needs to be

397
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,640
born in mind

398
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,360
uh also rfc 8404

399
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,720
so it covers uh current security um

400
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,039
uh and network operations as well as

401
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,520
management practices um and you see i've

402
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,480
put the quote from that rsc

403
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,559
which really highlights that for

404
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,799
enterprises in particular

405
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,960
uh where they're managing the data that

406
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,520
traverses their networks so these are

407
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,200
private networks as opposed to public

408
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
networks

409
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,799
um they they

410
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,200
really do have an expectation

411
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,799
uh quite so often uh of of

412
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,720
being able to specifically directly

413
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,120
manage what uh traffic is allowed

414
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,520
traversed to traverse those

415
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,440
uh networks

416
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
and it's quite different um an

417
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,480
expectation to what might be expected on

418
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,320
a typical public

419
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,720
network

420
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,799
and then final comment on this slide uh

421
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
which i think is just worth unpacking

422
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,120
which is for

423
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,760
onpath security actors

424
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
um

425
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
some of the data encapsulated by each is

426
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,880
of legitimate interest to them and loss

427
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,640
of access to that data which i'll come

428
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,400
back to later

429
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,960
um will potentially weaken the privacy

430
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
of users on those networks

431
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
so if you like this is where we get into

432
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,919
a bit of a quandary where by trying to

433
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,160
protect privacy we might actually weaken

434
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,559
privacy uh if we don't deploy things

435
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,000
with an understanding of the

436
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
environments that we're deploying them

437
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,520
into

438
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,039
and also again depending on context

439
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,960
again for some uh

440
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,080
networks

441
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,400
um such as a home network or indeed a

442
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
school network

443
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
uh issues like content filtering are

444
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,799
entirely appropriate

445
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,559
uh sort of considerations for the

446
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,280
network owner an operator

447
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,360
and in some countries actually

448
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,480
say in the school environment which

449
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,640
again i'll come on to

450
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
the school is required to to operate

451
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,080
content filtering so in any protocols

452
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,840
that defeat that

453
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,000
are actually making it hard for the

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,520
network operator to meet their

455
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,440
regulatory requirements

456
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,520
and that's clearly

457
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
an issue

458
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,158
next slide please

459
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,880
uh so uh

460
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,880
one of the key rscs rsc8744

461
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,360
so basically looked at some of the

462
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,000
considerations relating to encrypted um

463
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
sni

464
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,480
um it does within the text include a

465
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,640
include a fairly brief description

466
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,000
of what's characterized as unanticipated

467
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,200
uses of s i information in section 2.1

468
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,960
and a very brief two-paragraph

469
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,080
assessment of alternative options

470
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,799
for those usages in the event that the s

471
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,240
i data

472
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,080
is in fact

473
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,919
encrypted

474
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,280
um and

475
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,200
if you like there's a suggestion

476
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
that

477
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,640
you know most of those unanticipated

478
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,440
unanticipated uh usages

479
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
can in fact be delivered through other

480
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,720
means

481
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,280
um although that's not really sort of

482
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,400
fully covered in in the actual text

483
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,120
and importantly in this context

484
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,039
what it doesn't do is to

485
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,200
take into consideration

486
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,760
issues like uh the

487
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,840
cost of those alternative solutions

488
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,080
either financial cost

489
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,360
or the operational complex complexity

490
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,520
of those solutions or indeed the

491
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,440
technical capability

492
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,320
um of the parties that might be expected

493
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,840
to move to those alternative

494
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,360
solutions

495
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,159
or also the privacy implications for end

496
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,200
users

497
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,400
that might

498
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,080
might also be involved uh in that move

499
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
because for example if you end up

500
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
having to do deep package inspection of

501
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,480
all traffic that isn't necessarily good

502
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,440
privacy outcome for the affected users

503
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,480
um

504
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,240
if it's a consequence of something which

505
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,400
is intended to actually enhance rather

506
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,679
than weaken

507
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,039
their privacy next slide please

508
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,960
uh so briefly um we've considered in the

509
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,320
paper

510
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,640
um certainly impact on a couple of

511
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,400
different types of users

512
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,159
firstly schools

513
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,159
and we've called out specifically in the

514
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,400
u.s and the uk

515
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
uh schools are required to operate

516
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
content filtering

517
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
um in the uk they're required

518
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,760
um in a blanket way so all schools are

519
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,520
required to do so um in the us they're

520
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
required to if they want to qualify for

521
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,000
a particular type of federal funding

522
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,679
which i think i'll give a reference to

523
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,400
uh in the uh current draft

524
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,520
and in many instances they use sni data

525
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,720
in order to help them um with that

526
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,880
filtering

527
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
one of the issues here is they move to

528
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,320
what will typically look more like an

529
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,159
enterprise grade

530
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,880
solution as an alternative

531
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,720
there's potentially quite a considerable

532
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,960
expense involved in doing that

533
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,720
and also i know from firsthand

534
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,919
experience that the technical

535
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,000
capabilities of the support people in

536
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,120
schools

537
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,039
are nowhere near those

538
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,559
of technical people in enterprise

539
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,720
environments so it will be potentially

540
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,279
beyond the capabilities to implement

541
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,320
uh effectively and reliably

542
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,919
which we believe is

543
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,120
important a consideration

544
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,039
so then you get to some of the

545
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,320
alternative options for them uh

546
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,520
well if it's available in disabling ech

547
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,440
in client software

548
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,600
will potentially be helpful but i do

549
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,520
know that some of the current so client

550
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,080
software so

551
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,720
developers are not intending that it

552
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,320
will be an option that can be disabled

553
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
so the only other alternative for them

554
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,400
is to remove that software

555
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,760
which is potentially extremely

556
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
disruptive and very expensive if they

557
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,880
got a long-term usage uh of such

558
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,400
software and have to move to a

559
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,320
completely different platform

560
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
um and also certainly in the school

561
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,000
environment potentially just

562
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
moving completely away from bring your

563
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,840
own device as an option

564
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,200
again because

565
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,840
it becomes just too difficult to uh to

566
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,960
administer uh in that environment

567
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,039
and again that that is potentially also

568
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,520
disruptive

569
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,480
uh

570
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,960
briefly in the enterprise environment uh

571
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
again sni uh in

572
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
many installations aids content

573
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,880
filtering

574
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,080
um

575
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,840
including blocking access to malicious

576
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,520
content

577
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,159
by fishing etcetera and also in some

578
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,400
industries uh is an important part of

579
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,039
their compliance obligations

580
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,600
and clearly for any enterprise

581
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,760
not meeting their compliance obligations

582
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,559
is not up for discussion uh because the

583
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,480
cost implications for that

584
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,600
uh will be quite significant

585
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,919
um so they will have to find a way to be

586
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,039
compliant

587
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,360
um and if sni makes that harder that's

588
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,120
going to be an issue

589
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,440
for them

590
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,600
you'll say also byod is potentially

591
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,919
getting an issue uh in some corporate

592
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,440
environments

593
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,919
um and certainly a weak weakening cyber

594
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,919
defenses is a concern which i've come on

595
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,000
to i think on the next slide and of

596
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,120
course not all enterprises are equal

597
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,279
the sort of resources be it financial

598
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,120
and operational in a large enterprise

599
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,240
very different

600
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,799
to those available in a small enterprise

601
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,279
so we shouldn't just assume that

602
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,600
cost is not a consideration uh in the

603
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,240
enterprise space it absolutely is

604
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,120
in in many different sectors

605
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,918
next slide please

606
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,240
and then just looking at the threat

607
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,400
detection uh point

608
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,720
uh rfc 8404

609
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,880
uh highlights some of the issues arising

610
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,520
from uh increased uh encryption of data

611
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,840
generally and a number of those points

612
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,919
certainly apply here and i don't believe

613
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,840
have been considered

614
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,360
fully yet

615
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,240
and perhaps more directly relevantly

616
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,679
that there's a

617
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,679
current draft uh

618
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,480
indicators of compromise um which talks

619
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,320
about unsurprisingly indicators of

620
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,919
compromise

621
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,360
and the highlights

622
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,559
some of the issues there

623
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
where you start to

624
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,440
compromise uh current uh

625
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,640
defenses and uh sni data is absolutely

626
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,320
one of those indicators of compromise

627
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,840
which is currently fairly widely used

628
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,080
so potentially therefore uh encryption

629
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,440
of si data absolutely poses new new

630
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,000
challenges on threat detection

631
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,480
specifically and these don't appear to

632
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,840
have been considered

633
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,760
either in rst

634
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,000
before or the current uh

635
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,200
ech draft we certainly think

636
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,559
that draft ought to include

637
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,200
this issue uh in its security

638
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,080
consideration section which is

639
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,200
looking rather than focused on

640
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,760
this particular aspect of security next

641
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,080
slide please

642
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,840
since the diagram often helps to sort of

643
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,080
just convey the general point

644
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,559
in effect what we're trying to really

645
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,240
get across here there's

646
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,640
you look at the top diagram

647
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,840
that the desired effect

648
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,159
of the ecx development

649
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,720
is to ensure that uh communication from

650
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,200
a user to uh

651
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
their target takes place without

652
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,399
observation

653
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,559
or indeed interference that so that's

654
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,080
the intent uh behind this quite clearly

655
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,200
the potential actual effect though

656
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,799
of the of the of uh of this if more

657
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,159
thought isn't uh

658
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,200
applied is actually it might

659
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,159
uh prevent some of the defenses from

660
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,159
kicking in so they'll be

661
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,559
unable to see what's happening and in

662
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,799
reality it's going to aid

663
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,520
communication with malicious content

664
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,559
uh surveillance by client software

665
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,720
access to age inappropriate content for

666
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,760
example in a school or home environment

667
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,799
and on some networks access to csam

668
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,840
so

669
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,600
if you like the the actual effect is

670
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,000
potentially the exact opposite

671
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,159
of the desired effect

672
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,320
um and it's worth just uh throwing in at

673
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,520
this point um that that when we start to

674
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,480
think about specific special uh

675
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,120
use cases and uh certainly for

676
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,559
dissidents there are better tools

677
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,679
available

678
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,679
to avoid um

679
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,559
being

680
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,240
observed or their communication

681
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,120
interfered with uh tor springs to mind i

682
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,360
think kathleen on the

683
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,200
second spatialist today pointed out i

684
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,520
think the brave browser etc

685
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,760
tools like east h don't apply here

686
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,640
because

687
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,480
i think already about two years ago the

688
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,880
great firewall of china began blocking

689
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,039
tls 1.3

690
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,039
and encrypted sni anyway so

691
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,880
they're just blocking it completely so

692
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,640
it's not really applicable in that

693
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
context there are as i say others other

694
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,559
better tools

695
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,039
for that purpose uh i think the last

696
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,679
slide please

697
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,799
so uh

698
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,360
just a conclusion we believe that uh

699
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,520
the paper highlights

700
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,320
some new end user harms which are valid

701
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,559
or potential harms which are valid uh

702
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,840
and that have yet been fully

703
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,200
investigated and we'd like to

704
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,320
investigate those further

705
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,640
and as i've just outlined

706
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,880
uh sni encryption does pose new

707
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,679
challenges for threat detection which

708
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,080
by definition risks harming end user

709
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,440
security

710
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,720
um

711
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,880
and to just quote a section from rsc8890

712
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,720
um it's not good practice to either

713
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,399
avoid identifying harms or when they

714
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,480
have been identified it's not acceptable

715
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,760
to ignore them

716
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,799
uh

717
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,559
when they're raised so that's why we

718
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,480
believe this is something which needs to

719
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,159
be dispatched somewhere

720
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,919
but we'll welcome some views um on

721
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,440
where that might be and also any

722
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,919
questions that people might have

723
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,320
thank you

724
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,120
so

725
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,840
uh brendan

726
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,600
i'd just like to point out that this is

727
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,880
a very interesting um dichotomy because

728
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,960
we have an entire working group designed

729
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,799
explicitly to avoid this kind of

730
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,240
inspection it's called mask

731
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
and on top of that i'd like to point out

732
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,960
that anytime your security depends on

733
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,000
inspecting an encrypted link you've lost

734
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,600
before you've started

735
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,200
i mean if you want to do this kind of

736
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,720
monitoring it needs to be done on the

737
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,880
end node it's the only realistic answer

738
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,640
okay thanks

739
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,000
uh brendan

740
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
stephen

741
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,519
hi steven pearl uh

742
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,799
so

743
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,880
i guess i i i'm in the unfortunate

744
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,080
position of only having to be able to

745
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,600
discuss what this isn't

746
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,200
i think it isn't new

747
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,640
i think these considerations were raised

748
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,480
previously it isn't deployment

749
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,720
considerations because it's basically

750
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,320
saying ech is bad

751
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,760
deployment considerations would be how

752
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,200
you do it and or maybe how you do it

753
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,600
better and that's not this document

754
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,240
i don't think it is

755
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,320
useful really to be honest and i don't

756
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,519
think it's something that we should work

757
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,799
on so it isn't something we should work

758
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,000
on i think is the dispatch answer

759
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,880
okay thanks stephen

760
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,679
tommy

761
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,080
hello

762
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,480
tommy polly from apple so

763
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
i have a couple points um hopefully to

764
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,279
help with the dispatching here um so

765
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,159
first as discussed on the list all the

766
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,080
references to the for the users rfc are

767
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,000
in conflict with the meaning of that rfc

768
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,840
i think mark did a really good job of

769
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,080
explaining that clearly um so to that

770
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,799
end i think this form of the document

771
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,120
is not a good foundation to progress

772
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,480
now if we want to have discussions

773
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,880
around ech specifically

774
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,919
um i think that belongs as comments to

775
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,000
the tls working group

776
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,240
as brought up eight seven four four

777
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,720
already talks about this area

778
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,000
if the community really thinks that

779
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,760
needs revising you could imagine this

780
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,120
document but i don't expect that to

781
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
happen

782
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,559
um but i do think that there is a more

783
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,679
useful

784
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,840
way that we can talk about manageability

785
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,080
in providing better signals

786
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,600
and that solution shouldn't be to

787
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,720
prevent

788
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,200
encryption or esni

789
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
which is trying to enforce

790
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,600
more intentional sharing of data but

791
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,360
instead we should be working on filling

792
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,279
in the gaps for where intentional

793
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,640
sharing of data

794
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,279
to trusted parties to gain access to a

795
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,120
network or other things

796
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,799
where that should happen

797
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,720
so the iab is currently working on a

798
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,120
draft that calls for more engineering

799
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
work on new mechanisms for signaling

800
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,519
that is intentional and trusted

801
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,320
to replace the use of implicit implicit

802
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,679
signals like

803
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,760
the s i that were silently being used

804
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,600
for management but were not intended for

805
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,480
management um so this is

806
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,240
uh draft iab path signals collaboration

807
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,399
and so you can take a look at that that

808
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,080
can be discussed in architecture discuss

809
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,240
but it's essentially calling for

810
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
the need for more work in the ietf on

811
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,519
this

812
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,079
that would be a useful proposal to have

813
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,918
and then one last note uh for the

814
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,960
content filtering for school devices

815
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,199
there are already a lot better tools for

816
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,399
on-device filtering software and

817
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,159
parental controls that happen on the

818
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,480
endpoint and that's how these byod

819
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,399
solutions ideally should work and the

820
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,639
sni is a much less effective

821
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,639
tool for managing those even today

822
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,560
okay thanks tommy it sounds a bit choppy

823
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,399
but i think we got most of

824
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,320
of that ted

825
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,879
uh ted hardy speaking uh first i'll join

826
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,239
tommy and saying i encourage people to

827
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,599
look at the path signals draft i'm one

828
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,280
of the other co-authors of it i actually

829
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,480
don't think we had considered sni as an

830
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,079
an explicit path signal uh but certainly

831
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,239
if you're going to

832
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,159
send it as an explicit path signal it

833
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,079
would be a fascinating experiment to

834
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,680
make uh on the basic thing of this draft

835
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
i think functionally you're trying to

836
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,920
ask the community to reconsider

837
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,760
the consensus that

838
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,000
8744 represents

839
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,599
i think that means from a dispatch

840
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,960
perspective it has to go back to the

841
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,040
working group that produced ad744 which

842
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,400
is tls

843
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
i think tls will consider it very

844
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,760
quickly indeed

845
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,160
um but i think that's probably right

846
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,680
because i think that your

847
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,760
characterization of this

848
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,560
as not considered or not considered

849
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,520
uh significantly by 8744 doesn't

850
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,119
actually represent

851
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,280
uh the discussion it may represent the

852
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,200
text in the actual rfc but it was

853
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,359
considered quite extensively in the

854
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,520
production of 8744

855
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,040
and the characterization

856
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,240
characterizations in that document

857
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,320
i think show a consensus that there is

858
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,280
no way to tell the difference between

859
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,240
uh an on-path attacker and an on-path

860
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,599
manager

861
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,320
uh in the network uh

862
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,000
situation you're trying to describe

863
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,160
where you have no control over the end

864
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,880
devices and only control of the network

865
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,200
uh if you go back a slide to

866
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,119
your your um

867
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,000
two pictures of desired effect there's

868
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,119
really

869
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,680
no difference from the point of view of

870
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,880
the

871
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,119
uh

872
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,760
external observer between

873
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,000
uh the check mark and and your guy in

874
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
the hat i can't tell what color his hat

875
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,160
is and i have no way of stopping him

876
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,079
from dressing up as a check mark so i

877
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,240
think this has to go back to tls and i

878
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,520
expect you will find there that they

879
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,480
believe that they have already

880
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,520
considered it appropriately thanks okay

881
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,760
thanks i have to say i know there were a

882
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,440
thousand or so

883
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
messages in the mailing list at around

884
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,560
the time

885
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,400
of that document they seem to be more

886
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,960
focused on the technical

887
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,240
detail of the um

888
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,400
of the protocol rather than the actual

889
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,320
end users but that's a discussion that

890
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,440
can certainly be had

891
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,000
kathleen

892
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,480
so i'm not going to argue for this

893
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
solution in particular

894
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,400
um however there is a real problem so as

895
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,640
cto for center for internet security we

896
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,880
support all of the u.s state local

897
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,200
tribal and territorial organizations

898
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
that includes schools but it also

899
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,440
includes all your local governments

900
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
fire departments police departments

901
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,960
basically everybody that's under

902
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,680
resourced and so to do something at

903
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,640
scale

904
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,960
doing the endpoint is just very very

905
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
difficult right now we're using dns

906
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,200
based solutions to help with screening

907
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
with those types of organizations so

908
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,200
we're not using sni

909
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,439
um

910
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,599
but the problem is real because schools

911
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,119
are getting hit with ransomware all

912
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,320
these organizations get hit with

913
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,400
ransomware they get shut down critical

914
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,200
services oh including hospitals so that

915
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,599
it's also in the sltt bucket

916
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,200
um

917
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,119
so there is a problem to be solved i'm

918
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,400
not sure how we're going to solve it

919
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,560
because with dough there's you know and

920
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,280
and uh endpoints that aren't connected

921
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,760
to whatever the screening service is

922
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,079
you could be hit by malware and

923
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,240
ransomware so we have a real problem we

924
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,800
can't just expect to use safe browsing

925
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,119
and get beyond it and to manage it at

926
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,839
that scale right so there's a scale

927
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,520
problem because

928
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,440
these organizations

929
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,760
use high school students in some cases

930
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,599
to manage their security because that's

931
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,079
all they have

932
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,079
so i really wanted to emphasize the the

933
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,040
problem here and then it's a big one

934
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,720
i'm not saying to solve it with s and i

935
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,879
though

936
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,400
yeah but hope woman's inspired

937
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,760
yeah and certainly kathleen that's my

938
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
experience of schools as well and

939
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,520
equally many small businesses um that

940
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,200
the more complex we make stuff the

941
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,880
harder it is for them to actually have

942
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,720
any effective security and that's

943
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,640
something we need to think about

944
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,160
uh

945
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,480
it's me i'm marked as offline because i

946
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,160
so sorry i closed my laptop when i'm

947
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,800
walked up david's davidskenazi google

948
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,200
i'm gonna make a comment with regards to

949
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,560
dispatching but first um

950
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,240
i think kathleen did a really good job

951
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,720
of explaining the problem

952
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,359
is that there are networks today that

953
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,240
don't have many resources and

954
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,480
have to do something to protect users

955
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,680
and

956
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,839
i i i'm sympathetic to that i do

957
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,920
understand but i would like to ask a

958
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,680
clarifying question

959
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,320
is in what way does this draft or the

960
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,480
rfc that it could produce help solve

961
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,119
this problem

962
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,079
given that this is an early draft i

963
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,760
think the intent is to start to scope

964
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,440
out what the problem is in an

965
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,280
expectation as it develops we get

966
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,280
towards the solution

967
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,079
in your best case scenario of every all

968
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,680
the stars aligning and everything being

969
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,920
perfect what would be the ideal outcome

970
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,720
at the ietf

971
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,760
well as a minimum the

972
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,160
more consideration is given to these

973
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,400
types of users because at the moment the

974
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,200
voice of the user is quite hard to

975
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,400
detect

976
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,760
uh in a lot of the this development so

977
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,400
actually bring out front and center

978
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,480
so we have a sort of credible discussion

979
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,960
real end users like the ones that

980
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,720
kathleen so outlined

981
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,400
that's what we want to get to and then

982
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,079
find a solution that actually works for

983
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,079
them

984
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,359
so i mean more discussion is can be good

985
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,119
in this case i'm not entirely sure we've

986
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,760
talked about it but

987
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,880
like

988
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,119
discussion doesn't give them a solution

989
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:33,920
we

990
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,599
like i i think at the end of the day

991
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,520
what you're hoping is for ech to not

992
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,640
happen and even if you were to be

993
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,680
in your view successful here at like

994
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,760
making the atf not do that even though

995
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,359
you know we are and we've had this

996
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,200
discussion before

997
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,280
that won't help you the technology

998
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,520
exists it's out there there's open

999
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,040
source software

1000
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,599
and malware will not be limited by what

1001
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,920
we say in our nice ivory tower here at

1002
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,599
the ietf

1003
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,960
so

1004
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,040
i would really

1005
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,640
strongly

1006
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,720
encouraged this document to not be to be

1007
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,400
dispatched as

1008
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,200
not

1009
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,079
looked

1010
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,240
for new work at the ietf this has been

1011
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,800
discussed as the people in the cubiform

1012
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,079
you mentioned

1013
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,800
and is only an attempt at

1014
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,200
making a technology that is happening

1015
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,599
whether the itf wants it or not

1016
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,000
to just kind of delay it through itf

1017
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,839
process so i don't think it's this

1018
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,560
document is helpful okay thanks david as

1019
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,119
i said at the start this is not about

1020
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,280
stopping the deployment of the vch it's

1021
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,520
about a more thoughtful way and how it's

1022
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,720
deployed

1023
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,319
um rather than

1024
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,599
because you're right you can't put it

1025
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,000
back in the box but let's think how to

1026
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,319
do it so that it doesn't surprise people

1027
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,079
it doesn't amount it doesn't weaken

1028
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,160
their security which is where what we

1029
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,960
risk current

1030
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,920
thanks

1031
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,240
thank you it sounds like this discussion

1032
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,760
doesn't have any new elements but

1033
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,280
perhaps we take it to a forum that's not

1034
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,839
itf then

1035
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,359
okay uh ekka

1036
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,319
howdy erica scorland is all um

1037
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,359
so

1038
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,560
i'm also surprised to hear this

1039
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,400
characterized as new information i don't

1040
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
think it is um some of this discussion

1041
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,960
is 87 44. um it was discussed quite

1042
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,200
extensively um this is about the third

1043
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,040
document i've seen now with the sort of

1044
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,520
general content of wheat of people on

1045
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,880
path to a bunch of inspection and

1046
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,560
encrypting things interferes with them

1047
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,599
this is the con it's more or less the

1048
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,240
content 8404 844 actually has like a

1049
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,640
whole section of sni um

1050
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,040
uh nancy nancy okay wait had a document

1051
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,640
about this as well um

1052
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,839
um this is what indicators are

1053
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,280
compromises about so like this is like

1054
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,240
information which has been like

1055
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,200
extensively errored and discussed um and

1056
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,319
um nevertheless there's been strong

1057
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,000
consensus to perceive with with this

1058
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,520
work on penn state 87 44. um so um

1059
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,119
so i i guess i'm not really sure what

1060
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,839
the new information is here um

1061
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,880
um you know uh i i think it's you know

1062
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,000
um

1063
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,400
uh there's some discussion about 8890 um

1064
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,000
i think many of us perceived that we're

1065
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,240
acting in the interest of the users um

1066
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,560
um so uh i think it's it's pretty hard

1067
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
to like um i i don't think it's really

1068
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,240
fair to characterize this as the voice

1069
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,440
of the user has been absent and you're

1070
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,119
bringing the voice of the users um that

1071
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,160
the interest that this seems to

1072
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,680
represent such understand is the network

1073
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,680
operators as much as users um who

1074
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,520
believe themselves to be acting in the

1075
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,319
the interest leaders perhaps um

1076
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,440
so um

1077
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,040
this brings us that into the main point

1078
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,319
which is that the setting of concern

1079
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,079
here is the one where you have an on

1080
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,480
path expect inspection element which

1081
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,000
does not have effective control of the

1082
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,760
endpoint if it had effective control of

1083
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,680
the endpoint um it wouldn't need to do

1084
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,000
um local inspection um escaping suggests

1085
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,160
it could merely disable ech or disabled

1086
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,240
dns separate gps um either which would

1087
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,240
allow to inspect the um domain names

1088
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,560
they're going through um so um you

1089
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,760
mentioned that you thought people were

1090
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,760
not um intending to allow um disablement

1091
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,960
at the vch i'm not sure who you've

1092
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,520
spoken to um uh we have not we at least

1093
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,440
haven't firmed up our plans but as i met

1094
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,800
as i mentioned on um uh on on the chat

1095
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,760
um in firefox um eca just tied to doe

1096
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,640
and doe is easily disabled um

1097
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,440
so um and certainly is disabled when

1098
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,800
there's any evidence of effective

1099
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,560
enterprise management so the correct

1100
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,960
approach in this case um is to for the

1101
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,760
um

1102
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,000
uh it's for the error enterprise or the

1103
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,920
network to attain control the endpoint

1104
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920
and have doe and ech disabled and then

1105
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,119
they can continue to do the inspection

1106
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,640
they've been doing all along and if you

1107
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,760
can't do that then you're simply

1108
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,920
indistinguishable from any other on-path

1109
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,440
attacker or sorry from any on-path

1110
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,599
attacker um and so um like which the

1111
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,040
purpose of like this

1112
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,119
exercise is precisely to prevent on path

1113
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,119
attack measurements back to the data so

1114
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,800
um again like that is to control the

1115
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,640
endpoint that distinguishes um

1116
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,319
legitimate use from illegitimate use in

1117
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,240
this case um

1118
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,839
in terms of dispatch questions a number

1119
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:48,960
of people said the correct place for

1120
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,640
this to go is a tls uh if there's a new

1121
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,079
text you think is appropriate to be in

1122
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,800
the security considerations of um of of

1123
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,119
the ech draft um then i would suggest

1124
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,040
you suggested um i'm not sure what that

1125
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,440
text want to be um but um that place for

1126
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,079
that happens there

1127
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,880
and just to clarify

1128
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,599
i won't embarrass something here uh

1129
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,800
because that wouldn't be fair but

1130
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,119
certain other large uh client software

1131
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,240
developers

1132
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,640
have indicated that they don't intend to

1133
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,599
allow

1134
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,319
ech to be disabled uh in their

1135
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,160
deployment so it seems like

1136
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,160
mozilla is doing things in a different

1137
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,240
and arguably better way in that regard

1138
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,520
well as i said we have not decided what

1139
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,760
we're planning to do um i guess perhaps

1140
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,280
um i don't know which which developers

1141
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,319
you're talking about if it's chrome

1142
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,160
perhaps davey could speak to it um if

1143
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,440
it's not chrome i guess it'd be helpful

1144
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,319
for you if i thought it was

1145
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,280
okay

1146
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,040
thanks

1147
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,680
uh jonathan

1148
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,000
hoyland cloud player

1149
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,319
um i'd i'd like to know

1150
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,079
how you consider

1151
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,640
uh connection card lessing in the scope

1152
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,839
of this

1153
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,720
so

1154
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,839
given that certificates are not visible

1155
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,000
on the wire with tls 1 3.

1156
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,200
just doing sni inspection

1157
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,680
doesn't give you

1158
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,160
doesn't give you the ability to block

1159
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,640
bad websites quote unquote

1160
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,359
because you may well find that they are

1161
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,640
coalesced to some other website

1162
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,440
and

1163
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,400
unless you are going to advocate

1164
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,359
full

1165
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,839
terminate re-establish

1166
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,240
every outbound connection

1167
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,079
uh which is obviously incredibly

1168
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,599
invasive

1169
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,359
i think this ship has already sailed

1170
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,319
in fact well to be fair there's existing

1171
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,640
content filtering software which does

1172
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,720
filter on sni

1173
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,319
which is fairly widely used from a

1174
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,160
variety of vendors maybe that's a

1175
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,920
discussion we have offline in terms of

1176
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,240
some examples if that's useful i i just

1177
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,240
think that that software

1178
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,640
also fails to account for

1179
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,880
connection coalescing which is

1180
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,440
already deployed and already exists and

1181
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,040
is already used

1182
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,000
so

1183
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,839
as as even if you manage to kill ech

1184
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:08,720
um

1185
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,560
you're not going to achieve the effect

1186
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,640
you want

1187
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,440
okay thank you

1188
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,960
dan daniel

1189
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,319
uh hi there uh daniel gilmore aclu um i

1190
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,880
just wanted to um agree with previous

1191
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,400
speakers that this work probably does

1192
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,640
not belong at the ietf i want to point

1193
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,880
out that i have actually done

1194
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,960
maintenance work in school environments

1195
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,800
where there are content filtering and

1196
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,359
malware and ransomware concerns and yes

1197
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,040
it is a burden and the right way to do

1198
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,480
that is to

1199
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,880
do it on the endpoint um

1200
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,200
you're not going to block all malware

1201
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,359
you're not going to block all ransomware

1202
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,760
with sni detection this is the wrong way

1203
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,359
to solve that problem and we should not

1204
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,160
be breaking the other security uh

1205
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,880
goals that end users do have

1206
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,960
in order to try to half solve one of the

1207
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,079
other problems the right way to solve

1208
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,520
ransomware is make sure you have good

1209
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,960
backups

1210
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,400
thanks

1211
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,079
thanks daniel i think it's fair to say

1212
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,800
you're probably not typical of the uh

1213
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,760
level of expertise in in many schools uh

1214
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,880
sadly

1215
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,920
and also from a security point of view

1216
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,079
removing a layer of security doesn't

1217
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,960
feel like a good uh sort of solution uh

1218
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,880
in in that regard

1219
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,280
accepting is by no means perfect but no

1220
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,680
security is but multi-layer i think is

1221
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,920
generally accepted as better than a

1222
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,880
single

1223
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,880
point of fate potential failure but but

1224
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,800
thanks

1225
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,200
terry

1226
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,920
is terry there

1227
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,520
hey can you hear me

1228
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,040
we can now

1229
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,200
okay hey hey andrew i was saying that

1230
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,760
one of the major challenges with malware

1231
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,800
today is if you see uh they they're

1232
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,200
continuously updating their the way they

1233
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,000
use

1234
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,599
censorship technologies to avoid

1235
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,079
detection by passive network security

1236
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,680
services and one of the challenges that

1237
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,240
i have seen is they always there many of

1238
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
the malware families have started lying

1239
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,240
on the sni so for example this and i

1240
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,599
would say that hey i'm just visiting

1241
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,599
youtube.com but in fact it would be

1242
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,599
visiting malware.com and that pretty

1243
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,880
much throws

1244
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,720
anyone who is assuming that they have a

1245
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,400
content filtering and they can just look

1246
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,200
at sni and say that hey sni is going to

1247
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,880
let's say youtube.com and i'll just

1248
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,559
allow it but in fact it would end up

1249
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,640
going to a malware

1250
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,119
domain right that's one big problem that

1251
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,160
even without encrypted smi uh by just

1252
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,240
looking at smi you you won't be able to

1253
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,079
detect malware and block it successfully

1254
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,280
so this is

1255
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,520
probably for old malware families which

1256
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,160
are

1257
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,240
honest and giving you the right snl it

1258
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,400
would work but the new malware families

1259
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,839
are not doing that so

1260
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,920
uh even without an encrypted sni this is

1261
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,880
a problem even today

1262
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,800
okay thanks uh terry

1263
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,160
i think that's that's a call

1264
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,480
yeah i think we've reached the end of

1265
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,559
our queue here um just kind of summing

1266
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,160
up from the chair point of view it seems

1267
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,480
like the feedback here was uh pretty

1268
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,800
clear there's no action via etf to take

1269
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,160
here

1270
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,839
at the moment so thanks for walking us

1271
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,599
through it andrew and i think we're on

1272
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,280
to our next topic

1273
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,680
thank you

1274
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,160
which would be uh

1275
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,839
trustworthy and transparent digital

1276
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,640
supply chains s-c-i-t-t

1277
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,598
and hank will you be presenting

1278
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,919
great

1279
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,920
hi everybody is this fine

1280
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,079
okay i'm hank

1281
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,960
as indicated so yeah i'm talking about

1282
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,839
um

1283
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,240
trustworthy digital supply chain

1284
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,720
transparency services which is a

1285
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,319
mouthful so

1286
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,559
there's even more a mouthful of people

1287
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,119
on this slide so i'm i'm

1288
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,720
talking on behalf

1289
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,079
of multiple individuals and we have a

1290
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,599
and that's maybe something to highlight

1291
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,119
early on

1292
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,559
an email list already there's a

1293
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,880
non-working group email list on

1294
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,200
the itf space it's skit

1295
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,960
itf.org

1296
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,440
and thanks to all of the people that

1297
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,839
already commented before we are starting

1298
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,240
this presentation here because i think

1299
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,319
that's very useful they have some trends

1300
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,280
about

1301
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,720
replies they are ready but let's get

1302
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,040
into the some of the context

1303
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,760
i will be uh talking a lot of context

1304
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,480
first because before i come back to the

1305
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,880
skit stuff and so thank you

1306
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,400
um

1307
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,280
skit is of course sc it's supply chains

1308
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,319
and generic supply chain of course it's

1309
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,720
obvious there are entities in there

1310
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,359
and they have purpose and intent

1311
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,440
so some of them are designing things

1312
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,839
they give you a plan an activity and

1313
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,599
this goes into production at some point

1314
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,920
to create a commodity and this commodity

1315
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,680
is then brought throughout the world

1316
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,520
because you supply things to other

1317
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,680
people and at the end there's a consumer

1318
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,720
so that's very obvious i think so so

1319
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,680
coming to the ietf scope um there is of

1320
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,760
course software

1321
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,359
and software has a supply chain

1322
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,160
management component to it and and one

1323
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,000
very prominent one that everybody can

1324
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,280
look into

1325
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,520
it's not the only one is by far not

1326
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,280
though the only one but it's very

1327
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,000
obvious it's like github you have source

1328
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,839
and you can look at the source

1329
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,720
and the source will basically uh compose

1330
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,119
the things that you will in the end

1331
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,119
compile and build

1332
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,720
and that's the second step here so we

1333
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,559
have developers creating stories and

1334
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,680
then you go at some point to a release

1335
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,440
also temporal artifacts that are going

1336
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,839
in ci the continuous integration

1337
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,599
and then you create

1338
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,240
software artifacts so all of this is

1339
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,920
very common again you distribute them

1340
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,520
you package them and at the end they end

1341
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,960
up on your

1342
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,920
computer but also already here

1343
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,720
what you do have is uh on the ci and the

1344
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,720
distribution level some third-party

1345
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,440
endorsement that program in here and you

1346
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,240
do

1347
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,480
some artifacts that will never be

1348
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,720
published in the end so we have things

1349
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,319
that you might want to know about

1350
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,079
because they will affect the um

1351
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,480
quality of your product that will end up

1352
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,200
as your application next slide please

1353
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,598
click

1354
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,319
do i have to click the clicker

1355
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,800
it's remotely oh it's not somewhere it's

1356
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,040
doing it thank you sorry

1357
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,119
i didn't know so

1358
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,400
and and

1359
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,319
so why do you want to know about the

1360
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,000
supply chain you just care about the

1361
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,839
thing that is running on your computer

1362
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,480
right so so i'm starting with the right

1363
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,720
here and the right says

1364
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,720
but but sometimes i really want to know

1365
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,400
right i really want to know why this

1366
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,720
came to be why this is happening and

1367
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,480
later on in the slide deck uh you'll

1368
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,680
find some

1369
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,200
executive order thing you might heard

1370
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,160
about and so the real question is um

1371
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,680
what's the provenance of the things that

1372
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,760
will end up in my trusted computing base

1373
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,599
faster computing based means the things

1374
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,119
that can really believe and if it tells

1375
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,880
me stuff is happening

1376
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,040
so there's a lot of red

1377
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,559
text in this now augmented supply chain

1378
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,559
example this is about software bear with

1379
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,280
me here with the software and so you can

1380
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,559
for example poison the compiler

1381
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,880
and that makes you create different

1382
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,839
source

1383
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,839
sorry different binaries and then they

1384
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,359
they're based on the same source of

1385
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,280
course yeah but the tool chain now

1386
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,200
suddenly becomes relevant so you want

1387
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,119
maybe some have some insight on the tool

1388
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,079
chain and you want to have some uh um

1389
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,400
insight about the um um

1390
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
versioning that is in the end done so if

1391
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,599
you're just fake at the end of

1392
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,119
versioning it might look like the same

1393
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,240
thing so it's healthy still but it isn't

1394
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,559
and so so all these things are now not

1395
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,480
only about the binary that you create

1396
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,319
it's not about only the the artifacts

1397
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,160
are created but it's about the metadata

1398
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,720
around the supply chain and the contact

1399
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,400
so that's dependencies

1400
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,640
the gray arrow on top next slide please

1401
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,200
and all of this is not old

1402
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,480
sorry it's new no this has been very old

1403
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,920
so in 2016 i think that's the uh oldest

1404
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,119
quote here

1405
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,960
all this happened before right so this

1406
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,640
is not a new problem everybody knows

1407
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,240
about these problems everybody has seen

1408
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,319
these problems before and and still

1409
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,799
they're happening so that's why there's

1410
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,880
this famous executive order because

1411
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,599
they're still happening today and um

1412
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,799
basically that's what all the site is

1413
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,480
about i could go on and on but these are

1414
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,559
just references that basically say this

1415
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,799
is not a solved problem

1416
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:02,480
independent of any solution that is

1417
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,400
there today

1418
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,079
and the reasons for that so next slide

1419
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,400
please

1420
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,880
because

1421
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,200
this is a problem that's everywhere

1422
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,799
and it's not solved in a generic way so

1423
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,680
uh what i'm going here is a fish that's

1424
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,760
at the top and chips

1425
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,680
that's at the bottom

1426
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,839
the cold chain of seafood is a supply

1427
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,760
chain as well as the chips that you put

1428
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,000
into computers so fish and chips are

1429
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,839
also things you want to talk about this

1430
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,000
is not only about binary transparency

1431
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,480
which is nice to talk about but it's

1432
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,000
about the endorsements of all of these

1433
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,599
things has my fish exceed the

1434
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,680
temperature of one degree the celsius

1435
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,440
then the cooling chain cool chain has

1436
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,440
been broken has something being and then

1437
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,359
now picking again some red text out here

1438
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,040
of the bottom has some um it's called

1439
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,839
insert trojan circuitry that's a very

1440
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,240
hot topic i think so you want some

1441
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,559
transparency into that um what there may

1442
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:59,520
be a

1443
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,079
falsification of test results so this is

1444
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,559
actually bad but hey i'm telling you

1445
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,520
it's good

1446
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,040
and what's very invoked right now is

1447
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,119
like on the very right there we are in a

1448
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,280
circular economy today yeah other thing

1449
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,720
is circular so is my recycling cigarette

1450
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,720
recycling really really or is fixtures

1451
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,640
right there's so many attacks on these

1452
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,440
things and this is just microchips again

1453
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,440
there might be attacks on fish you might

1454
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,119
see the result the next day if you eat

1455
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,559
the wrong fish

1456
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,319
but but it's not always as obvious when

1457
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,480
you have a

1458
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,480
malfunctioning microchip in your

1459
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,839
computer so next slide please

1460
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,240
so coming back to the very first slide

1461
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,920
all of this is about the auditing in the

1462
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,240
end so you want the transparency of

1463
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,799
course serves a purpose and the purpose

1464
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,000
is auditing and now there's this eo

1465
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,480
i have to reduce 1402

1466
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,880
14028 which is about the increasing the

1467
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,799
nation's cyber security from buying in

1468
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:57,839
the u.s

1469
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,839
and and there are a lot of lot of things

1470
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:00,960
about

1471
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,359
artifacts here which are then described

1472
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,440
we are the softer bills of materials and

1473
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,640
that's fine

1474
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,440
so describing artifacts statements about

1475
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,520
the supply chain artifact that's cool

1476
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,520
but this is not what this is about

1477
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,079
so this is a very good use case now we

1478
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,920
really want to address that use case

1479
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,440
there's a lot of

1480
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,880
sense to address that use case but we

1481
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,040
also do the fish and chips and all the

1482
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,440
other things right so so the

1483
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,559
transparency that this uh work is about

1484
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,559
is not just about software which is like

1485
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,520
chemistry with sweat and spd-x and salsa

1486
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,640
and the cyclone the x was the

1487
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,480
vulnerabilities and then you have to

1488
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,319
measure all that you have to understand

1489
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,720
the statements that are now have made

1490
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,400
been transparent by the transparency

1491
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,240
service but that's nice

1492
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,040
but we're not about that statement level

1493
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,000
we are one layer above we're about the

1494
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,240
global interoperability of creating

1495
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,720
transparencies about all these

1496
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,919
statements next slide please

1497
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:02,000
so that's basically the core intuition

1498
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,920
the transparency ledger basically makes

1499
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,040
you

1500
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,640
uh that ensures that a malicious actor

1501
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,839
actually cannot contradict other people

1502
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,760
that will be seen

1503
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,319
a lie will be made non-repudiational

1504
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,960
it's very obvious i think as a goal and

1505
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,280
so the different actors on the supply

1506
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,160
chain can react on this on inconsistency

1507
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,640
actually and also it's about that you

1508
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,440
provide the service and that you control

1509
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,440
basically it's a transparent

1510
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,160
confidentiality so you control

1511
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,440
what is confidential word is transparent

1512
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,119
the the thing what we provide here is

1513
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,880
that it's interoperable however you do

1514
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,400
it if you just have one contextual

1515
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,839
partner fine

1516
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,240
if you want to show it to the world fine

1517
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,000
but the thing is what the itf building

1518
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,319
blocks are used here are for is

1519
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,799
transparency about the statement about

1520
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,319
the artifacts

1521
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,079
so that all the consumers of the claims

1522
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,520
can basically say

1523
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,839
i can vouch that they made this

1524
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:01,200
transparent

1525
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,920
i can give you now a tiny thing and

1526
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,960
we'll come to that of course it's some

1527
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,359
itf technology that can't anything back

1528
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,040
that tells that and there are examples

1529
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,040
that transparency systems actually work

1530
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,400
i'm not going into the details here

1531
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,760
right now but uh uh this is the

1532
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,599
this previous work that shows okay that

1533
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,200
that makes sense and some of that is

1534
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,440
actually the certificate transparency

1535
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,200
and some of it is the binary

1536
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,440
transparency which are all very specific

1537
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,839
use cases all over this uh we again we

1538
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:32,319
are uplifting this to a to a global

1539
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,960
level then higher layer so to speak next

1540
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,440
slide please

1541
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,640
so we have two things

1542
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,599
if

1543
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,440
talking about the service the service

1544
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,760
maintains this append only ledger that's

1545
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,240
basically the thing that contains the

1546
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,839
thing you can't take back if you say it

1547
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:51,599
out loud so to speak

1548
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,240
and then if you say it out loud if you

1549
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,640
put it to the service you will get back

1550
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,160
a counter signing thing that's the

1551
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,280
receipt

1552
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,599
and it's cryptographic proof that some

1553
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,000
identity has said this at a given point

1554
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,440
of time and you don't have to actually

1555
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,520
understand what the statement means it's

1556
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,359
really important that you can't

1557
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,160
re-verify that it has been made and it

1558
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,160
was available at that time that somebody

1559
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,920
did this and that is the issues

1560
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,400
responsibility effectively and the the

1561
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,559
identities we involve here you could

1562
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,200
think sure you're going with pkix first

1563
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,599
but we want to abstract that a little

1564
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,960
bit with the webdid from w3c which

1565
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,359
basically is a uri pointing or

1566
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,160
identifying sorry to a specific identity

1567
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,760
document so we want to have a little bit

1568
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,640
of flexibility here what kind of

1569
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,880
identity system you want to use that's

1570
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,720
why the current proposal is to use dead

1571
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,160
and so

1572
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,079
the very important thing is

1573
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:48,799
the

1574
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,960
first statement and maybe we go to the

1575
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,799
next slide i guess there's a there's a

1576
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,440
architecture picture yeah exactly so you

1577
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,960
you have this artifact it's a fish it's

1578
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,480
a very top they have the flow now from

1579
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,480
the from the top to the bottom

1580
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,839
and the artifact is the thing you want

1581
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,119
to talk about you create a statement

1582
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,720
about the artifact

1583
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,640
and then you wrap it

1584
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,480
in an envelope and now you can basically

1585
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,720
all kind of see this is cozy so we are

1586
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,440
talking to cozy and itf building blocks

1587
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,920
here to sign by an issue of the

1588
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,280
statement

1589
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,720
and there might be a little bit of

1590
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,880
unfortunate terminology but this for now

1591
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,559
we call this a claim

1592
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,559
and this already includes the identity

1593
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:25,839
of the issuer

1594
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,440
but the really important thing now is

1595
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,839
that you sent this already signed thing

1596
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,760
that you're responsible for having

1597
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,760
managing the key material to this

1598
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,400
transparency service that has a ledger

1599
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,640
and back you get a counter signature

1600
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,920
about a

1601
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,440
ledger based thing

1602
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,280
that is now again available to you and

1603
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,880
now you can validate the signature of

1604
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,480
that receipt

1605
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,400
and the important thing here is

1606
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,760
air gap

1607
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,920
you can validate this

1608
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,559
fact here to have exposed this

1609
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,920
to the transparency service globally by

1610
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,440
a receipt that you can validate offline

1611
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,119
and that's very useful and sometimes you

1612
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,480
don't believe that and then you go back

1613
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,400
to the transparency service at the right

1614
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,240
edge here and go to the ledger and can

1615
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,319
do all the other trails you can find out

1616
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,480
does it really make sense to me so the

1617
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,200
auditors in the end have now two things

1618
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,039
to do they can replay letter servers in

1619
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,720
turn and they can

1620
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,079
just look at the receipt that they

1621
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,880
collected so both is viable in most

1622
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,640
cases sometimes you do one sometimes

1623
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,079
with the other sometimes if you're both

1624
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,839
and so next type

1625
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,920
please so this is about the cozy world

1626
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,039
so this is the first step you issue your

1627
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,720
statement

1628
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,319
and there are some things in here like

1629
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,680
they did at the top huh there's

1630
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,839
something you know like elk and key id

1631
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,440
that might make a lot of sense then

1632
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,680
there's something called the feed

1633
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,680
and this might be new work we want to

1634
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,920
talk about so this is like the subject

1635
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,079
you're talking about the feed is and now

1636
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,680
we come back to the example of the s

1637
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,160
bomb my version updates so it's still

1638
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,839
the same thing it's thunderbird sorry

1639
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,359
i'm not saying any names but it's it's a

1640
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,599
software um edit

1641
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,079
my editor my text editor right so and

1642
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,839
now it gets a new version so in these

1643
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,760
versions i have a provenance and a

1644
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,280
history that's a feed i mean it's the

1645
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,760
issue of using the same key to add on to

1646
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,359
that so there's history and at some

1647
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,440
point say this is discontinued

1648
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,839
and i put an end to this feat

1649
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,760
but sometimes i just die as a company

1650
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,119
and i don't have the time for that and

1651
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,359
that doesn't ever happen so now you can

1652
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,280
really check by the transparency service

1653
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,880
okay there was a continuous update of

1654
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,640
this feat but suddenly that stopped

1655
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,559
maybe that's a red flag for me maybe i

1656
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,599
shouldn't use that anymore so feeds are

1657
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,039
the subjects we are talking about and

1658
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,720
the rest of like a cti

1659
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,440
um you might be very very afraid of

1660
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,520
um yeah let's let's go to the next slide

1661
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,400
i think

1662
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,839
i think that's enough on this topic and

1663
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,480
the append thing is now we have a ledger

1664
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,799
that's a hash tree it's a merkle tree i

1665
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,480
think that's very obvious

1666
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,240
um it could be done distributed in the

1667
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,240
blockchain we are doing this as a

1668
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,319
decentralized uh

1669
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,440
um

1670
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,079
history replica thing and and the

1671
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,920
important thing to make to ensure some

1672
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,280
scalability here um you cannot just only

1673
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,119
assert one statement but a bundle of

1674
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,720
statements and that creates a new hash

1675
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,400
route so if you're familiar with the

1676
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,520
concept of

1677
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,200
merkel trees you can see there's already

1678
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,200
some automation down here

1679
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,720
the important thing is at the bottom

1680
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,119
again i think which is a new counter

1681
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,839
signing specification for cosy that

1682
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,599
would include a counter signing proof

1683
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,760
that an operation has happened with a

1684
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,480
bunch of statements potentially on the

1685
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,319
h3 and there's a step but you get back

1686
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:32,799
so you get your send in the signed

1687
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,240
envelope

1688
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,680
the signing involved for cozy what you

1689
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,520
get back is a counter signature

1690
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,160
basically specifically tailored to the

1691
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,839
hash tree principles here and that is

1692
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:44,559
the offline validatable receipt that is

1693
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:45,760
one of the

1694
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,079
value ads i think the solution provides

1695
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:51,559
next slide please

1696
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,359
so you're not to don't have to you don't

1697
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:55,520
have to do this alone so we are not

1698
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,359
expecting that you are adhering to one

1699
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,760
global ledger owned by i don't know acme

1700
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,359
arc but

1701
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,200
you could do that you can also have your

1702
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,359
own with your own contextual partner and

1703
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,119
now there's a spectrum between those

1704
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,920
extremes okay and the spectrum uh is i

1705
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,880
think addressed by federation

1706
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,480
so everything we built here and this

1707
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,359
might be

1708
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,839
up to for the discussion uh is something

1709
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:20,799
we want to do in a federated system of

1710
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,280
transparency services so the identities

1711
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,599
might have trust relationships uh so the

1712
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,520
web debt comes in again and how you

1713
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,880
correlate this

1714
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,680
and i think uh yeah this is an open open

1715
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,920
topic i think it's it's a goal it's on

1716
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,039
the roadmap

1717
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,039
but that's it's certainly something we

1718
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,640
have to take into account because this

1719
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,960
should not be ships in the night uh this

1720
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,400
should be again that's why we're doing

1721
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,640
this in an interoperable level with the

1722
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,880
transparency with cosy and such

1723
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,240
and the receipt

1724
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,520
mechanism

1725
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,280
here in the itf next slide please

1726
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,760
so this is not just theoretical

1727
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,520
there's a running code but this running

1728
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,119
code is very young

1729
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,280
so please bear with me so that's from

1730
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,119
the confidential consortium framework

1731
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,119
because it was already there and it

1732
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:10,400
adhered to like let's say 75 of the

1733
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,880
requirements so we made some running

1734
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,559
code that basically has the through the

1735
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,119
the green bubbles here like the primary

1736
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,400
that's the primary ledger we have

1737
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,559
replicas of it and between them is

1738
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:22,559
running a consensus protocol

1739
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,960
so one of these things doesn't work

1740
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,359
is differing from the others you get

1741
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,119
even more guarantees and that is where

1742
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,160
rats kicks ends for example right so if

1743
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,799
every of these nodes operate as they

1744
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,240
should be and they don't they shouldn't

1745
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,559
be able to provide you with attestation

1746
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,400
results that they do the things they are

1747
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,000
supposed to do and nothing else because

1748
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,920
well they didn't

1749
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,640
so we want to add guarantees on on the

1750
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,440
central level first and because we know

1751
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,680
that people who create the an original

1752
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,799
statement might not be in the position

1753
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:58,400
today to create rats viable evidence i

1754
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,839
don't know when they

1755
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:01,119
catch a fish

1756
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,440
on a boat i want to say this is the

1757
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,960
cooling chain now

1758
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,960
maybe that is not red supported so that

1759
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,520
is nothing we require today but it's

1760
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,720
foreseeable feature but what we can the

1761
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,200
most definitely require today is that

1762
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,040
the central service that is the cluster

1763
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,040
of transparency services could be

1764
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,080
supported by or is effectively supported

1765
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,399
by remote association technology

1766
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:26,880
as done by the itf and we have some

1767
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,960
examples here that the scx protected

1768
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,759
items are running in the ledger stories

1769
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,600
sdx is an example because of this

1770
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,839
running code that's not restricted to it

1771
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,000
it's just a first proof of concept let's

1772
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,759
think about this as uh

1773
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:42,000
more broader than this

1774
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,799
next slide please

1775
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:46,238
so yeah

1776
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,560
the takeaway is this is basically only

1777
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,158
itf technology but i'm talking about

1778
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:52,960
right now we're signing things with cozy

1779
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,399
the payload

1780
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,839
is opaque

1781
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:56,960
everybody can talk about

1782
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,719
interoperability of payload effectively

1783
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,719
but that's not our concern here with

1784
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,198
this work it's one layer above the

1785
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:04,799
transparency has to be interoperable

1786
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,439
otherwise how should you know you cannot

1787
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,279
agree on everything fish temperature

1788
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,880
could be a picture of a spoiled fish

1789
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,439
okay fine you can't standardize that you

1790
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,439
may be able to standardize most of the

1791
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,600
s-bomb stuff but that's also really

1792
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,198
really hard if you follow the discussion

1793
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,198
out there like the i don't know cyclone

1794
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,359
x s pdx and why you have to do a sweat

1795
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,359
thing right so that's already a problem

1796
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,198
by itself and that's only software so if

1797
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:29,279
you look at the whole supply chain

1798
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,960
it might be better just to focus on the

1799
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,040
transparency of that thing and i think

1800
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,040
cozy is an excellent building block and

1801
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,719
i'm not the only one there was a list of

1802
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,198
names at the beginning here and and so

1803
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:43,279
to add on to this cozy um uh issuer um

1804
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,000
authenticity i want to say uh the reds

1805
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,399
output i think as attestation results

1806
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:51,359
defined today would help there and again

1807
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,000
transparency services with certificate

1808
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,840
transparency and the ambiguous thing

1809
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,840
that is called binary transparency

1810
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,560
there's a lot of meanings uh has rep has

1811
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,960
a precedence so there's one rfc we are

1812
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,040
borrowing a lot of terms from that

1813
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,600
but it's not that okay it's it's it's

1814
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,760
transparency but on a higher level so

1815
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,600
that's my take-home message for this uh

1816
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,840
sac dispatch thing and i hope it is of

1817
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,520
interest to the itaf because that's i'm

1818
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,560
here

1819
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,679
we want to have some guidance on how to

1820
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,120
proceed on this work

1821
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,000
and so that's hopefully less than 20

1822
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,880
minutes i actually don't know

1823
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,120
thank you

1824
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,040
oh yeah oh i'm sorry i have a last light

1825
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,360
so yeah this is last edition so if

1826
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,280
you're free

1827
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,880
after this session

1828
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,719
you can gather outside

1829
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,480
and just around the corner there's a

1830
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,000
conference room

1831
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,159
and uh we can we continue discussion

1832
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:49,840
about this we have a regular meeting on

1833
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,280
tuesdays it's by chance 5 p.m

1834
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,800
on tuesday so uh we made this above like

1835
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,560
a pre-buff it's not an actual buff it's

1836
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,800
a barb off and and and i don't know i

1837
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,719
heard sometimes people find beer at

1838
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,719
barbos maybe we do maybe we don't i

1839
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,120
can't tell about this uh but it's around

1840
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,120
the corner if you want to meet it's 5

1841
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,560
p.m uh like at the coffee table and uh

1842
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,239
if anybody's interested in joining in

1843
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,640
that and doesn't have lunch plans before

1844
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,040
uh 6 p.m today

1845
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,640
maybe just join the discussion there's a

1846
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,280
link here it's in the slides um

1847
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,320
maybe someone is so nice to copy that

1848
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,640
link into the meet echo chat then you

1849
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,480
can just join wherever you are even if

1850
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,519
you're at dinner

1851
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,600
so i almost forgot about that

1852
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,080
and uh yeah so that's basically it um

1853
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,000
that's that's our proposal here and i

1854
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,440
hope um we find a place

1855
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,719
and we can do a queue if

1856
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:51,760
um

1857
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,400
if you agree i don't know yep we have a

1858
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,640
bit of a queue built up i think antoine

1859
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,640
is the first one to go

1860
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,159
uh yes

1861
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,159
so uh i just want to make some

1862
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,080
difference based on comments that were

1863
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,080
made in the chat during the presentation

1864
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,679
so i think there were several comments

1865
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,120
about uh

1866
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,679
this having been discussed before and

1867
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,159
why uh should itf want to

1868
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,239
try to standardize this no

1869
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,080
so i think

1870
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,920
i should be quite clear that the main

1871
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,880
application from itf point of view is

1872
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,280
transparency for binaries and software

1873
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,920
supply chain

1874
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,920
so at this point

1875
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,679
there are many actual deployed

1876
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,760
implementation of binary transparency

1877
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,040
systems

1878
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,159
made by firefox made by google made by

1879
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,239
microsoft and

1880
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,840
it's a bit concerning that there is

1881
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,600
currently no interoperability at all

1882
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,440
between these systems

1883
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,120
and one of the reasons that we think

1884
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,480
that

1885
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,520
the kind of demand for implementations

1886
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,679
is going to increase

1887
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,840
very quickly is confidential computing

1888
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,159
which is a use case where

1889
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,560
you have hardware that can provide a

1890
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,000
remote

1891
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,080
measurement of binary that is running

1892
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,239
somewhere else and you want to interpret

1893
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:07,840
the security of this binary and

1894
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,199
essentially the only way that you can

1895
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:12,239
make this useful is through transparency

1896
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,920
and that's one of the big driving

1897
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,840
factors that justify having more

1898
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,400
operability

1899
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,280
for a large-scale transparency system

1900
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,840
system that would work for

1901
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,000
complex

1902
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,440
software or even

1903
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,000
web service environments

1904
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,400
thanks antoine um i'll uh i'm next in

1905
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,719
the queue so taking off chair hat moving

1906
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,520
to participant hat so this seems like

1907
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,159
clearly a big piece of work that i think

1908
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,600
i agree with the discussion in the chat

1909
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,600
that if anything is if there's an ietf

1910
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,199
problem here we need to have a buff to

1911
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,360
kind of validate uh that there's broad

1912
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,239
agreement on this and there's a

1913
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:55,040
community to solve it i think there's i

1914
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,880
would probably suggest two

1915
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,199
broad areas of preparation for that buff

1916
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,280
one is kind of

1917
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,920
validating or kind of focusing in on a

1918
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,800
fairly specific problem um

1919
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
where people can kind of understand a

1920
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,560
specific architecture specific

1921
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,960
interoperability problem in particular

1922
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,199
um and you know kind of focusing this up

1923
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:17,280
a bit from what is currently designed as

1924
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,320
a very very broad

1925
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,000
problem statement

1926
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,040
the second thing i would suggest

1927
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,960
focusing on is kind of building up the

1928
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,640
community aspect of validating there are

1929
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,719
other folks who are shipping real uh

1930
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,880
systems out there who want to who want

1931
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,880
to solve this interoperability problem

1932
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,239
so i think antoine is correct that we

1933
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:35,760
have a bunch of

1934
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,360
systems out there these days that are

1935
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,400
not currently interoperable um but it's

1936
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,920
also not clear to me that's a problem

1937
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,360
because a lot of these things are

1938
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,040
intravender firefox's binary

1939
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,520
transparency is done by is verified by

1940
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,880
firefox and so there's not a bunch of

1941
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,679
need for interoperability so um

1942
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:53,360
validating that there are people who are

1943
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,120
going to ship whatever product the itf

1944
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,400
might come up with

1945
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,239
um you know what is kind of the other

1946
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,000
suggestion i would make in terms of what

1947
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,120
we need what we need to solve and above

1948
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,159
and then i'll pass to eric

1949
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:07,520
that makes a lot of sense so just

1950
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,800
interjecting before uh

1951
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,960
so yeah the the the the point is

1952
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,360
actually really do people need that

1953
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,920
interoperability or is it is it not

1954
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,120
necessary

1955
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,600
right so that is i think i think that we

1956
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,880
really have to

1957
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,920
uh come to a conclusion with

1958
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,239
because if if nobody needs an

1959
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,320
interoperable way to find out if the

1960
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,480
supply chain statements are true then

1961
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,560
then then this is not not necessary

1962
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,040
right so yeah sorry you got it no no

1963
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,080
please um so yeah i think first like i

1964
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,159
think that not very lead like yeah this

1965
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,960
is gonna need a buff if anything um so

1966
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,120
the higher the question for me is like

1967
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,960
you know what the relevant community is

1968
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,280
and how much we're seeing um so antoine

1969
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,480
mentioned that there's like you know

1970
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,800
open a lot of different bts efforts and

1971
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,320
um you know i'm i'm flattered that

1972
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,320
people are acting as if the firefox one

1973
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,760
is perhaps a little more alive than it

1974
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,679
really is um but um on you know um and

1975
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,320
they aren't interoperable um um but um

1976
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,679
you know it's not creating me making and

1977
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:10,719
another one is going to solve that

1978
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,239
problem so i guess my question is are

1979
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,679
those people going to come and they want

1980
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:14,960
to standardize and make their own purple

1981
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,440
standard um i know there's similar work

1982
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,760
um you know what's often called web3 and

1983
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,520
so are those people comment coming and

1984
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,800
want to work on this so i think like you

1985
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,800
know the um

1986
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,080
uh

1987
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,080
you know you know before we for itf is

1988
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,360
an effort right we should make sure that

1989
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,159
like we're getting enough of the

1990
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,600
relevant community that we're actually

1991
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,679
creating a converged standard rather

1992
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:34,719
than which creating earth's there the

1993
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:35,760
people that those people will then

1994
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,679
endure so i think that's that would be

1995
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:38,719
the thing that i think is absolutely

1996
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,560
most critical for the buff to get into

1997
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,560
um i the second would be what is the

1998
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,800
minimal viable like um thing that can be

1999
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,320
done here around the sort of maximum

2000
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,560
maximal division you're proposing um the

2001
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,560
maximum visions are good but um but in

2002
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,159
terms of making progress making minimum

2003
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:55,760
viable is valuable um and so um you know

2004
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,679
uh uh uh

2005
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,440
dkg hand with a little bit of direction

2006
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,600
i think that's valuable um um for my

2007
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,440
hand waving i guess i would say that i

2008
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,840
think that the um that the ledger aspect

2009
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,360
of this has perhaps been oversold in

2010
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,679
many cases um you know um we got pretty

2011
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,920
far um with ct with basically no

2012
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,040
meaningful like third-party

2013
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,000
verifiability um and so um you know

2014
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,760
descent to which that is like not that

2015
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,679
big a deal then okay but that's a big

2016
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,280
part of the big part of the value prop

2017
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,480
you know counter centers will get you

2018
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,960
pretty far so um um and certainly for

2019
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,880
most the cases like we're looking for bt

2020
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,320
like if you just had counter signatures

2021
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,440
you'd actually be like getting

2022
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,880
emotionally there so i think you know

2023
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,320
anything we can just film the problem

2024
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,400
down would be valuable

2025
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,280
yeah yeah

2026
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,800
the getting the people in the right room

2027
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,400
as a diet people in the room and also

2028
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,400
show that there is a minimum viable

2029
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,080
solution that people can agree on is of

2030
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,560
course part of the process and uh

2031
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,880
i think it's adrian

2032
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,080
i don't know

2033
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,840
masks yeah steven pearl um so

2034
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,600
yeah i i think richard and ecker said

2035
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,600
mostly what i wanted to say is that you

2036
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,120
know

2037
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,960
above seems like the right dispatch if

2038
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,719
there's you know if you can get a bunch

2039
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,000
of people interested in the topic i

2040
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,080
think it's a it's a good topic

2041
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,520
um

2042
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,960
in addition to kind of trying to come up

2043
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,239
with a minimal

2044
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,600
piece of work that focuses on

2045
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,400
interoperability for the ietf part

2046
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,480
it's also a giant topic so i'd say try

2047
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,199
and also find a small bit

2048
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,800
box it yes

2049
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,080
yeah and

2050
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,199
yeah so i think there could be a

2051
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,440
possible buff here uh if you if you get

2052
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,600
more people involved and there is such a

2053
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,679
small chunk because otherwise i think

2054
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,760
the buff would be just

2055
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,199
kind of likely to waste a whole bunch of

2056
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,840
time only discussing scoping

2057
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,760
and maybe never coming to conclusion

2058
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,640
yeah we don't want to meander again and

2059
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,440
again

2060
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,600
about the same binary transparency thing

2061
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,920
that has been yeah you know i i would

2062
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:48,239
agree with that and and the next in line

2063
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:49,520
who is

2064
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,760
i think i'm at next day

2065
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,640
uh so i'll be real short because i had a

2066
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,320
number of points to make and richard

2067
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,000
made uh all of them but since he asked

2068
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,239
those who are arguing for a buff to uh

2069
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,600
say what the boss should accomplish i

2070
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,800
just wanted to weigh in that said i

2071
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,960
agree i think some of the main points is

2072
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,880
to make sure that uh

2073
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,080
that there is a need for

2074
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,280
interoperability that there would

2075
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,719
actually be multiple implementations

2076
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,000
that are actually interested in

2077
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,440
implementing the same thing as approach

2078
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,880
to price terry stuff and also that uh

2079
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,719
the sets of people that represent

2080
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,239
implementations of those i would

2081
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:21,840
actually be coming to ietf in other

2082
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,199
words are the right set of people in the

2083
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,880
room and would they actually want

2084
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,320
implement stuff because we've had other

2085
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,920
cases of interesting problems to be

2086
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,199
solved and uh i can think of cases where

2087
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,400
there wasn't agreement that we needed

2088
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,080
interoperability in another case there

2089
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,679
was an agreement that the ietf actually

2090
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,840
had the people coming to it to do it and

2091
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,280
so i think the point of the book is to

2092
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,719
actually establish those things are true

2093
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:42,000
so thanks

2094
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,320
thank you

2095
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,400
hi yes uh it's an interesting problem i

2096
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,800
support having a buff

2097
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,440
however the i think that

2098
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,000
of this whole chain

2099
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,840
the amount that is actually relevant to

2100
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,560
itf is fairly small

2101
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,800
the reason that i think the itf would be

2102
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,360
valuable for the itf to have a buff is

2103
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,239
that this is a chain

2104
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,480
and at the moment

2105
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,360
we have we don't have people

2106
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,639
in all the parts of that chain talking

2107
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:19,440
to

2108
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,960
in one place

2109
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,280
and working out where to send each of

2110
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,120
the work items

2111
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,840
so for example i was involved in code

2112
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,880
signing

2113
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,199
back in the 1990s

2114
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,400
that technology

2115
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:36,800
works but hasn't moved on from there

2116
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,239
we still sign the software distribution

2117
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:42,400
we do not sign

2118
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,960
the code that actually runs on the

2119
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,719
machine

2120
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,000
in a standardized way we could move to

2121
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,719
do that we could standardize all that

2122
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:55,840
part but you would need to have

2123
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,760
the microsoft

2124
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,199
apple

2125
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:02,639
google the linux community involved in

2126
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,000
the room

2127
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,679
to do profitable work on that side

2128
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,840
at the other end

2129
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,040
if you want to do work on the

2130
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,000
development part of the cycle you need

2131
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:16,880
git

2132
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,800
now i know that you have a microsoft uh

2133
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,159
research person so github

2134
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,480
would be you know i i would

2135
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,320
if you're going to have a buff i would

2136
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,040
say get github uh to bring the get

2137
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,520
people into the room because they have

2138
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,440
technology that is very close to being

2139
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,199
where we need it to be

2140
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,840
the problem is

2141
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,679
signing your

2142
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:42,880
um

2143
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:43,920
commit

2144
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,040
doesn't do quite enough

2145
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,679
and finally and i'm absolutely serious

2146
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:50,560
here

2147
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,199
if you want to get any anywhere

2148
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,600
do not mention web3 do not mention

2149
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,400
blockchain and absolutely you have not

2150
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,599
mentioned proof of work

2151
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,239
mentioning i said ledger i said ledger

2152
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,159
but i think that's maybe neutral enough

2153
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:11,280
i don't know yeah um i mean like you

2154
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,600
pretty soon that technology is going to

2155
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,719
be like yeah say you've got leprosy

2156
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:18,080
um

2157
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,880
we need to go to harvest blocked chick

2158
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,560
so i think that there might be some

2159
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,480
useful work we can do

2160
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,520
in itf

2161
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,920
with on the identity part

2162
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,199
and on that chain part

2163
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:36,159
uh but we've got to be pretty careful

2164
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,000
yeah i think this has to be carefully

2165
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,920
worded also what you just said was it

2166
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,000
would be the initial box that we were

2167
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,840
talking about it would be a little bit

2168
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,920
bigger when we run when we talk about

2169
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,320
the uh um running codes signing but well

2170
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,480
that's delving into the i don't know for

2171
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,639
example confidential computing space but

2172
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,120
we have a strong overlap that's not bad

2173
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,520
but maybe that's the second step

2174
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,360
so maybe we have to really find out what

2175
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,239
the initial box is and then go from

2176
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,239
there to what you just said so i think

2177
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:08,800
that the path is right so but i think we

2178
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,600
have to carefully uh compartmize the

2179
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,360
problem so that people don't are scared

2180
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,880
away like you're trying again to boil

2181
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,080
this here right this will never break

2182
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,560
this is like the code signing over again

2183
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,159
so yeah but co-signing did work it's

2184
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,719
different technology it just doesn't do

2185
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,320
quite enough exactly

2186
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,480
yeah

2187
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:35,040
exactly yeah sorry for interrupting

2188
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,679
yeah okay

2189
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,920
thanks

2190
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,040
daniel

2191
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,400
hi there uh daniel kahn gilmore um so

2192
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,800
uh i find this kind of work interesting

2193
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,400
but i think a boss is the right place to

2194
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,880
go and i would specifically ask for the

2195
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:51,920
both

2196
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,199
to think about

2197
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:56,560
what actionable outcomes there are

2198
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,159
for whatever systems you're trying to

2199
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,120
design

2200
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,199
right if all of this is yeah i just want

2201
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,280
to know where my code comes from i just

2202
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,679
want to see this transparency stuff

2203
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,320
but there's no

2204
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,719
there's no concrete actions that can

2205
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:11,840
result

2206
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,040
then

2207
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,360
we've built a lot of mechanism that

2208
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,360
doesn't actually do anything

2209
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,199
right and i worry about this in a lot of

2210
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,560
different contexts not just technical

2211
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,920
ones but transparency without

2212
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,600
accountability doesn't actually get you

2213
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,040
as far as you'd like it to be right we

2214
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,679
think of transparency

2215
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:28,480
so

2216
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,840
as you're thinking about what are the

2217
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,679
interoperable goals here think about the

2218
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,239
interoperable actions that can be taken

2219
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,400
not just in the positive case where okay

2220
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,040
everything is on the chain we're fine

2221
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,800
um but what are what are the actions

2222
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,480
where you don't want to run something

2223
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,040
because it didn't match this and how can

2224
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,280
how can you actually get to that point

2225
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,600
um i think that's often missing the

2226
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,280
folks who you want in the room here are

2227
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,400
going to include people from the

2228
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,920
reproducible builds community i

2229
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,600
mentioned that in the chat

2230
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,639
that's reproduced pool dashbuilds.org

2231
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:00,560
they've been doing this kind of work but

2232
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,639
from the inside out whereas i think what

2233
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:03,679
you're trying to design here is

2234
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,679
something from the outside in the folks

2235
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:06,960
who have been doing that in different

2236
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,639
contexts will have a lot of insight

2237
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:12,000
about what uh the stuff actually on you

2238
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,199
know

2239
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,440
close to the machinery looks like and

2240
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,400
and what you can get to do so thanks

2241
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,639
thanks i think that's a valuable and

2242
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,840
very true statement thank you

2243
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,879
it's you

2244
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,920
david's kanaz google sorry i didn't get

2245
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,760
up dkg was in the queue before me but he

2246
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,679
seemed to have disappeared

2247
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:40,639
um

2248
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:42,400
so first off thanks for this

2249
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,199
presentation uh this is the first time

2250
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,040
i'm thinking about software signatures

2251
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,480
and then wanting fish and chips for

2252
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,800
dinner

2253
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,639
this was great but then as the

2254
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:55,040
presentation went on you did gave me

2255
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,840
like a pretty serious spike in anxiety

2256
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,880
this problem is very big to the point

2257
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,960
where it makes my head spin

2258
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,000
and so

2259
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,080
kind of coming coming back to like the

2260
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,400
dispatch questions and where we go from

2261
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,360
here

2262
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,480
i think the first dispatch step

2263
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,280
is a bar buff which is really great that

2264
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,199
you're doing that because a lot of good

2265
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:20,400
itf work starts that way and so

2266
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,840
this you know is early that's where i

2267
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,480
would start so absolutely that's great

2268
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,320
uh and you know if you have beer even

2269
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:31,440
better um and then next steps um

2270
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,599
so

2271
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:35,600
i think

2272
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,679
you definitely need to figure out a way

2273
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,560
that you can present this without my

2274
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,400
head spinning i'm sure i'm not the only

2275
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,280
one

2276
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,480
and so

2277
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,400
teasing out like from what other folks

2278
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,520
have said

2279
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,600
which part do you really belong in the

2280
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,000
itf and which part don't so i think

2281
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,159
there's value in explaining kind of the

2282
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:56,400
overall ecosystem

2283
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,360
um

2284
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,639
and then

2285
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,560
so people know the context but really

2286
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,360
focusing on like what parts we need

2287
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,159
i wouldn't spend any time on like the

2288
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:09,440
solution yet like jose or whatever like

2289
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,280
things you have like that will come

2290
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,159
later

2291
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:13,840
but really saying okay these are the

2292
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,159
bits that we need to do here

2293
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:18,480
and what i would so what i would suggest

2294
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,520
for you is to spend the barb off

2295
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,360
meeting the people who are interested

2296
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,440
and figuring what those bits are with

2297
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,480
them

2298
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,480
and then kind of bringing that back at a

2299
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,719
future meeting or on the list to perhaps

2300
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,280
hope probe off i think this is a good

2301
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,960
direction to go in but the scope is

2302
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,120
really really big right now and i've

2303
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,159
never seen a itf effort with such a huge

2304
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,239
scope succeed but if you manage to scope

2305
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:44,480
it down to something you can actually

2306
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,639
make progress

2307
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:49,120
so thank you david um so the the two two

2308
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,040
pieces that that we currently think are

2309
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,520
in the box are just the the issue thing

2310
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,440
and the receipting

2311
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,840
all of the framing how is this useful

2312
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,320
who doesn't really need that i think yes

2313
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,400
that should be a growing topic and i

2314
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,239
hope to have some discussion today

2315
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,080
basically soon and yes we will

2316
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,840
definitely make this happen so that we

2317
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,080
can have in a four month interval an

2318
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,760
actual buff maybe

2319
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,000
and and and we'll discuss the results of

2320
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,480
this this uh intermediate discussion

2321
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,879
cooler

2322
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,719
great so lost in queue and so

2323
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,159
um

2324
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,719
i do support this work as well

2325
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,880
i would like to see that we're not just

2326
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,000
considering scale for those signing code

2327
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,520
and

2328
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,920
and for building supply chain but for

2329
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,639
those using it later as well

2330
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:40,719
so we don't wind up with a solution that

2331
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:42,239
is just really not manageable for

2332
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,960
organizations and requires just tons of

2333
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,440
resources and the architectural patterns

2334
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,679
for management that we've created all

2335
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,360
along so that's something that i will be

2336
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,719
looking out for

2337
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:54,239
um

2338
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,800
and so consensus seems to be

2339
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,560
the recommendation for this to go to

2340
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,800
above if the ads agree

2341
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,000
um

2342
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,840
there's a lot of interest and i think

2343
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,679
the eyes the ietf could put on it would

2344
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,120
be really helpful

2345
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,239
yeah that is

2346
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,520
yeah exactly thank you so i can't look

2347
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,960
at you at the same time some of this

2348
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,960
confusing so that's carefully thank you

2349
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,040
so the eyes of the ietf should help us

2350
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,320
shape that box

2351
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,800
as david just said and i think uh we

2352
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,520
have two pieces and and they might

2353
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,679
already be very specific but i think we

2354
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:31,760
are the viable but still again this will

2355
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,080
be a process thank you i think that is a

2356
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:37,280
nice response uh from the group

2357
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,960
here and yeah

2358
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,000
um again at 5 p.m

2359
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,800
out of this door basically let's meet up

2360
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,280
and and and go around the corner and and

2361
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,920
have a first chat about boxing and what

2362
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,920
is outside the box and who thinks inside

2363
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,000
the box thank you

2364
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,159
all right so i think that was our last

2365
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,320
talk and i believe richard has the

2366
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,480
summary ready to go

2367
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,639
and so i'll turn over

2368
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:03,840
or do you want me to run through the

2369
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,280
summary if you want to just wire it to

2370
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,679
me i'll i'll read it out but did we have

2371
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:09,679
uh key consistency

2372
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:11,520
folks

2373
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,840
chris christie no you're not gonna it

2374
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,840
was removed from the agenda

2375
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,400
okay thank you

2376
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:21,199
yeah i could talk about a review our

2377
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,120
findings here um

2378
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,040
so just going through the topics we have

2379
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,400
covered today

2380
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,719
uh talked about updating parameters for

2381
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:33,199
syslog that got dispatched to uta

2382
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:36,400
second thing was uh updating the iana

2383
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:39,440
ssh parameters registries um

2384
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,280
feedback was to move that to 80

2385
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,679
sponsorship and roman agreed to sponsor

2386
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,560
that or work work with the psycads to

2387
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,840
figure out who to sponsor it

2388
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,719
third thing was andrew's talk about ech

2389
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:54,960
deployment considerations

2390
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,560
resolved to take no action on that

2391
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,320
and finally on the trustworthy supply

2392
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,840
chain thing the feedback was to take

2393
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,280
that to a buff and i think there was

2394
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,600
some good feedback in the discussion

2395
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,400
uh for how the the proponents should

2396
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,480
kind of work to refine this uh and kind

2397
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,080
of set themselves up for a successful

2398
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,320
ball from that

2399
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,760
so i think that's that's the findings i

2400
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,520
have thank you for everyone for the

2401
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,960
presentations and for the good

2402
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,719
discussion there

2403
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,159
with that i think we're on to any other

2404
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,559
business

2405
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,920
hearing none i believe we are then

2406
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,120
adjourned

2407
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,320
thank you all

2408
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:37,799
have a good evening

2409
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:13,639
are you seeing it side by side

2410
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,199
i was editing i'm not sure what you mean

2411
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,120
so if you go to side by side

2412
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,639
for example

2413
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,960
you'll see that this ended up in a gray

2414
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,679
text block but i don't know what how you

2415
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:32,320
started those i i mean so i'm assuming

2416
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,960
it's because there's an empty line

2417
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,520
or that there is a tab

2418
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,719
although i tried i tried to start

2419
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,480
i couldn't figure out how to

2420
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,480
all right
