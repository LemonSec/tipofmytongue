as we all know and getting people

33
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,000

us

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160

vitiliev um leandro um i don't need to

64
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,040
speak too much longer i've introduced

65
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,879
the fact that we have a good agenda in

66
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,760
the

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
data tracker we've got the note well for

68
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
people to take advantage of

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,360
folks should mute if they're not

70
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,400
speaking

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,239
and i'm going to turn it over to you

72
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,120
leandro to do any other housekeeping and

73
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,360
intros or i should say most people have

74
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,680
20 minutes to speak with 5 to 10 minutes

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,959
for q a

76
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,799
if the speakers would like to cut their

77
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,159
presentations a little short so you have

78
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,480
more q a no worries and if we've got

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,959
time afterwards we'll um we'll just

80
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,560
entertain more questions because we have

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,720
a really great group of experts with us

82
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,080
here today

83
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
and i will try and speak more slowly i

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,120
noticed

85
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,920
in some of the traffic from the list

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,599
but it was important that we all say our

87
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
names um slowly i'm jane coffin

88

the chat is on the left

112
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,880
of

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
the medical

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,160
application

115
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,639

117
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,000
um

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,880
so

119
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,639
um regarding

120
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,520
presentations uh

121
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
dimitri told me that

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,759
he might arrive a bit late because he's

123
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,840
in the u.s

124
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,000
and the time is tight

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,479
and i don't see mark

126
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,960
brigier

127
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
in the list so maybe we might need to

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,880
skip the second presentation

129
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
um

130
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,960
so well the first presentation is

131
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,240
it's mine

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,039
um it's a warm-up

133
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,000
um presentation uh it's based on on

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
something that i that i already

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
presented a couple of years ago but

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
i wanted just to revisit the topic a

137
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,318
little bit

138
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,039
okay so this is this is my presentation

139
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
it's about as you see about the internet

140
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,520
and in relation with environmental

141
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,880
sustainability

142
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,199
is are we talking about an evolution or

143
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,039
a revolution needed

144
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,440
in that respect

145
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,840
so um

146
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,880
but there are some numbers

147
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,960
sorry let's assume problem

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
well

149
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,759
you know there are

150
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,120
billions of

151
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
ict devices

152
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,840
on the users and in the

153
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,919
network and um

154
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,039
to what extent can we afford

155
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,759
that growth

156
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,800
and because our working group is about

157
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,120
internet for all all means

158
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,199
a lot of devices in the end

159
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,639
and um

160
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,720
and imagine about the energy spent and

161
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
materials spent on on all what we do in

162
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,880
the on the internet

163
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,199
it used to be that the internet is was a

164
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,240
solution

165
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
to the problems of

166
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,759
excessive footprint but the internet

167
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,400
itself is also nowadays becoming bigger

168
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
and bigger

169
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,240
and climate change is something that we

170
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,639
have to do right only we only have one

171
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,560
opportunity because we only have one

172
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,440
word

173
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
and um

174
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
and then well the carbonization that

175
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,599
so-called like that uh the reduction of

176
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,800
emissions the reduction of uh material

177
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,919
impact on on the on our infrastructure

178
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,960
requires solutions on time and that that

179
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,360
is either evolutionary or revolutionary

180
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
this this

181
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,759
graph doesn't come from us it comes from

182
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,800
itu

183
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,319
but they've done a work to translate

184
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,800
the ipcc

185
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,479
temperature trajectories of climate

186
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,520
change into what is the requirement for

187
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
the ict sector

188
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,319
and the ict sector is growing and you

189
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,440
see the blue

190
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,000
line from 2015

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,319
to 2030 it's growing in terms of

192
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,680
emissions

193
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,639
but

194
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,520
to

195
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,720
comply with the 1.5 degrees of

196
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,319
temperature

197
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,039
climate change increase let's say we

198
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,760
have to not continue increasing but

199
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,159
radically going the opposite direction

200
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,679
of reducing about half of the emissions

201
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,880
from 2015.

202
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,919
so this is

203
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,560
connected to keeping

204
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
climate change to 1.5 degrees which

205
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,160
means

206
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,680
no

207
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,480
no

208
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,040
severe effects on on climate

209
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
and this is going to happen

210
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
uh soon in fact because because there

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
are um

212
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,880
reports that says that um to meet this

213
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,200
deadline on 2030 we need to

214
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,120
by 2015 20 20 2025 we we need to pick on

215
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,519
and start decreasing by that year and

216
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,920
this is in only nine or ten ietf

217
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,399
meetings um so we have to do something

218
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
so that by

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,959
by

220
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,920
in 10

221
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,040
ift meetings we we not only have ideas

222
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,120
but also we have solutions for the

223
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,880
problem

224
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,760
that are already delivering impacts

225
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
with actions

226
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,399
electricity is one is one aspect

227
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,000
i found another

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,399
reference on literature that says that

229
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,200
ict technology overall

230
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,760
might be consuming about

231
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,839
50 more than 50 percent of global

232
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,800
electricity and and um and contribute to

233
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,720
the total a total of about 23

234
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
of uh

235
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
greenhouse gas emissions

236
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,399
uh it's surprising to me but this is uh

237
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,720
reported in a publication

238
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
at least

239
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
we have to take into into account if you

240
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
look at the

241
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,240
contribution of of the internet and of

242
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,720
the user devices

243
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,200
to greenhouse gas emissions

244
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
do you see that manufacturing i mean

245
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,640
production has

246
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
a big impact a

247
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,240
huge impact

248
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
use of the device itself doesn't have

249
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,839
too much

250
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,720
uh but of course if you add to it and

251
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,959
this is just the device but if you look

252
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,480
at the overall consumption the use phase

253
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
consists on a part on

254
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,160
on the device itself but also

255
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,000
we are using servers on the internet we

256
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,240
are using the network uh

257
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,519
the mobile network and the ip network

258
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,360
and therefore

259
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,240
the total among the total amount about

260
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,360
half of it is connected to network um to

261
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,600
the enable infrastructure

262
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
so we have a

263
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
an issue with that

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,320
so the question is uh

265
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
i'm not coming with a solution i'm just

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
coming with a problem um

267
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,519
what can we do uh can we do anything to

268
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,440
really prepare for a peak on 2025 or to

269
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,279
meet the expectations for the 2030 uh

270
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,640
maybe we can't

271
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,560
and because

272
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,440
probably evolutionary approaches like

273
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,600
reducing optimizing

274
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
energy and materials in in the protocols

275
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,320
might not really give us a change of

276
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,959
trend and um i'll be joking

277
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,959
revolutionary maybe we need to go back

278
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,680
to fidonet or we need to come up with a

279
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,880
new ipv7 or something or some other

280
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,760
proposals about radically new network

281
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,120
architectures

282
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,360
and there are the typical ingredients

283
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,160
that we know from from protocol design

284
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,120
about

285
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,079
saving

286
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,040
data saving transfers uh optimizing

287
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
protocols reducing uh the

288
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,519
payloads of messages

289
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
tweaking uh timers and and so forth

290
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,800
uh but this is more like evolutionary of

291
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,120
course

292
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,279
um i mentioned that in the previous

293
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,120
meeting uh two years ago there is

294
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,839
already a lot of ietf

295
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,560
rfcs that deal with for instance only

296
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,480
with energy

297
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,839
and probably i'm missing many of them

298
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,600
so there is work in the atf no doubt but

299
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,079
but do we have a plan let's say to to

300
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,959
really meet these deadlines and because

301
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,040
well it's only once that we have a

302
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,079
chance

303
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,120
um

304
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,040
so um

305
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
i wanted to

306
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,760
i wanted to collect ideas um

307
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,279
here you have a link i

308
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,279
this is very long but here you have a

309
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,160
short

310
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
url which redirects to the preference to

311
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
the previous one

312
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
in which you can

313
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,480
you can add your own ideas

314
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,079
about

315
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,360
what we can do

316
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,399
i won't explain my own ideas these are

317
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,440
in the slide but i want you to really

318
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
come up with a proposal

319
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
and uh and in fact um

320
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,720
this can be interactive uh if you

321
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,120
if you just uh

322
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,519
go to the page uh to the url that i

323
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,399
mentioned

324
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,839
you can um

325
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,079
you can add things you would like to to

326
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,880
keep

327
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,600
i'm joking here like keeping snmp well

328
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,279
it's an example or something that

329
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,399
shouldn't be

330
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,279
should be there anyway

331
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,959
radically um

332
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,199
just like uh

333
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,920
quickly associative examples and then of

334
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,839
course you can you can type your own

335
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,120
card

336
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,320
like this

337
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,399
and you can also instead of creating a

338
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,279
new card you can always like add

339
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,240
um

340
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,600
an extra point to one of the uh

341
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
notes that are already there

342
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,279
so uh and then well it has a plus one uh

343
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,440
boat okay

344
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,760
so um

345
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,600
this is uh

346
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,959
this is my proposal that we collectively

347
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,760
despite we so we don't have a

348
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,079
breakfast uh place where we can sit

349
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,639
together and discuss so let's try to use

350
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,880
this board to

351
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,160
collect ideas about how can we

352
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
try or not try to

353
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
to meet this

354
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,600
this

355
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,839
environmental

356
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,199
challenge because as i said at the

357
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,560
beginning

358
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,279
there is about the internet for all

359
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,240
but to have an internet for all

360
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,079
means we have to make sure that it's

361
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:54,880
also

362
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,399
for the planet

363
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,720
and um

364
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,519
and our infrastructures are intensive in

365
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,680
materials in energy

366
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,839
in devices which are more or less

367
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,800
durable

368
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,079
um

369
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,360
of course we can as humans use it less

370
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,680
but but there are new applications in

371
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,959
the original

372
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,040
talk about using it more

373
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,160
so

374
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,079
having more connectivity in more places

375
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,360
means having more base stations

376
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,959
more dense

377
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,239
to have more people connected

378
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,480
so we can yeah we can come up even with

379
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,600
more frugal protocols but

380
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,399
but

381
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
more frugal

382
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,320
implementations means more opportunities

383
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,120
to connect more people and then

384
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
providing access to more people means a

385
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,759
rebound effect of uh well

386
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,399
having more units of this more efficient

387
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,079
device that in the end

388
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,279
might have a the opposite effect that we

389
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,040
try

390
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,800
and um

391
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
well we have to

392
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
decide if we want to give give up on

393
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,560
this or let's say revolt and from irtf

394
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,519
it's a ideal place to start

395
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,680
planning

396
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,560
what can be done

397
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,600
to

398
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,199
to reach 2025 with a small decrease

399
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,279
of impact and see if we can or not

400
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,160
reach 2030 with a significant

401
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,199
contribution from the internet to the um

402
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,519
climate change mitigation and that's the

403
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,880
iotf way

404
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,680
try to come up with a research agenda

405
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,600
discuss the topics and

406
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
prepare documents that could later on

407
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,279
translate into

408
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,880
into industrial specifications

409
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,680
so that's my

410
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,720
my

411
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,240
um

412
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,279
cry let's say to to focus on

413
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,959
environmental and the environmental

414
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,199
challenge because as i said before

415
00:16:59,199 --> 00:16:59,920
it

416
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
we only have one opportunity to to make

417
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,839
it or fail

418
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,919
that's my presentation i don't know if

419
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,280
you

420
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,760
questions comments

421
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,919
okay uh i'm michael vetzel am i up may i

422
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,280
speak

423
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,320
okay

424
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,640
uh thank you very much for this i very

425
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,480
much agree that this is important work

426
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,000
and important to do

427
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
i

428
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,280
i only disagree

429
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
with one of the tiny notes that you have

430
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,559
already put there which says quick

431
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,480
versus green

432
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,240
i

433
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,280
think that well it's not just thinking i

434
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,600
did a test on uh what happens with with

435
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,160
wi-fi devices and

436
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,000
it's clear i mean up to now still most

437
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,840
mobile phones they implement a

438
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,760
relatively simple power saving scheme

439
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,400
where you would or other wi-fi devices

440
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,080
where you would simply after a couple

441
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,480
hundred milliseconds after activity go

442
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
into sleep mode

443
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,520
so if we're able to cut the flow

444
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,679
completion time of transfers if you just

445
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,520
are a bit more efficient at transferring

446
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,480
data

447
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,320
in fact that can have a big impact so i

448
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
did simple tests with you know different

449
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
initial window values and

450
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,000
using a window of 10 instead of two or

451
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,840
four in the case where you don't have

452
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,440
any packet loss because it's not always

453
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,559
better right

454
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,120
you can cut energy usage by something in

455
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,360
the order of twenty thirty percent

456
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,760
so uh it doesn't have to be a trade-off

457
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,600
and i think this view of

458
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,919
performance versus uh

459
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,400
versus being green as a trade-off i

460
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,039
think is is what partially harms

461
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,360
activity in this area right because i

462
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,600
don't turn on power saving mode on my

463
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,480
phone because it hurts my performance

464
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
right as i i think trying to combine

465
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,600
these i think this this is a good way

466
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,918
to go

467
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,960
yeah thank you for your view i i tried

468
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,400
to be controversial

469
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,240
but yeah i agree with you that people is

470
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,360
not

471
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,039
willing to

472
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,280
degrade significantly their performance

473
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,760
and if there are other ways we must

474
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,600
follow them i know i mean the comment of

475
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
quick is can be quick in terms of fast

476
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,000
or quick the you know the um

477
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,559
application layer http just like um

478
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,890
yeah but yeah thank you

479
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:34,650
[Applause]

480
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,320
i see bessena is also on the queue

481
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,039
yes uh thank you thank you andrew this

482
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,520
is such a wonderful topic very dear to

483
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,080
my heart and i'm so glad that you have

484
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,520
brought it up so as um

485
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,080
somebody from ripe ncc i would like to

486
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,360
invite you to

487
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,120
speak about this at the ripe meeting

488
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,240
which is coming up in may in berlin

489
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
and um

490
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,200
we also have a sig com proposal for the

491
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
green tech internet workshop and uh if

492
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,120
you would love like to be our speaker

493
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,360
there or participant uh we will send you

494
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,200
an invite together with university of

495
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,039
amsterdam colleagues

496
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,600
and now not speaking as a ripening

497
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
employee but as a

498
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,320
planet citizen

499
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,400
if i had to choose between two options

500
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
in your

501
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,880
title i would go for revolution

502
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,120
thank you

503
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,200
you would say you would go for uh

504
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,960
evolution with r

505
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,840
isn't it with an r

506
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
rebellion

507
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,918
yeah yeah yeah

508
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,960
yeah the difficulty is always like uh

509
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,679
i would also go in that direction uh

510
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,480
simply because evolution sounds like uh

511
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,320
it's uh it's about

512
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,200
changing the growth not simply changing

513
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,440
the sign of the greece but that we have

514
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,760
to find ways to to make it work

515
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,799
i see

516
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,200
david

517
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,480
feel free to speak

518
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,360
hi david oliver

519
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,080
i see on the cambridge university

520
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,559
bitcoin electricity consumption index

521
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,760
that last year bitcoin consumed

522
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,640
137 terawatts of electricity

523
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
about one percent of the global

524
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,760
electricity bill

525
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
so i wonder if

526
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,760
working in the margins on this

527
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,919
is something working on something on

528
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,679
cryptocurrency

529
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,159
algorithms is vastly more important than

530
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,480
working on the margins on what we're

531
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,799
doing on devices

532
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,000
yeah i agree with you that there are

533
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,840
big contributors and and sounds like

534
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
consensus algorithms in in

535
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,679
bitcoin and

536
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,200
and cryptocurrency

537
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
have a margin for improvement a huge

538
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,159
margin uh but anyway i think uh it's not

539
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,799
about choosing one um

540
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,440
let's say topic and focus on it only but

541
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,679
we have to identify

542
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,080
all sources for savings probably and

543
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,200
find out

544
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,799
how they contribute to the total

545
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,720
reduction but yeah yeah a good very good

546
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,960
point

547
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
ignacio

548
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
hi everybody

549
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,679
hi

550
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,480
um well thank you

551
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,679
thank you for your presentation

552
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,120
just a brief comment first

553
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,919
problem with the crypto devices are they

554
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,080
are based on

555
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,200
consuming energy is is the the idea of

556
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,320
uh

557
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,679
in in the in the deep end is the idea of

558
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,559
how they works

559
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,080
as fast you need to in order to produce

560
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,799
a new a new new block

561
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,360
this is one of the problems

562
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,080
on the other hand

563
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,360
in the chat about software efficiency

564
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,000
normally we build software without

565
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,679
regard about the efficiency i mean

566
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,559
how long is our code how

567
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,120
how times it trans on the cpu and so on

568
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,799
and this is really a substantial problem

569
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,880
and

570
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
i'm not sure but i think that the

571
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,120
distributed um

572
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,279
distributed version of the things could

573
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,400
be better but not always we we have to

574
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
take

575
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,640
to keep an eye on this on that uh well

576
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,720
this is all my my comments thank you

577
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,400
very much

578
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,600
thank you so much um

579
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:58,799
uh

580
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,760
um yeah um

581
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,919
i suppose that when when people work on

582
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,000
iot

583
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,480
systems they are fully of the

584
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,039
limitations of the device

585
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,919
energy i mean and battery power

586
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,480
and cpu power but on the general in

587
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,159
general

588
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,039
without i mean outside the iot world

589
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,720
we assume that

590
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,960
if we develop software hardware will

591
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
will come and provide us the resources

592
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,760
to

593
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,200
do

594
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,600
so there is more and more complexity in

595
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
the code that's we mean that hardware

596
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,039
can manage without our networks can

597
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,480
manage with that and if we think that um

598
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,159
climate and global warming is it's a

599
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,480
it's a boundary then of course we we are

600
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,919
more in the iot mindset than in the um

601
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,159
in the future hardware will provide us

602
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,600
whatever we need

603
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,880
whatever we propose in in the protocols

604
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,240
um and yeah i agree with you that um

605
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,000
current blockchain

606
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
systems are based on

607
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
on a competition to

608
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,400
consuming energy

609
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,320
translated to cpu power

610
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,880
well it sounds like this is not viable

611
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,279
or it's not scalable we cannot say that

612
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,000
this model of um

613
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,480
computing transactions would work for

614
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,919
everyone in the world

615
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,600
if everyone would we're using

616
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
cryptocurrencies for every

617
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,960
monetary transaction

618
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,440
in our planet uh well simply there will

619
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,840
be no planet already

620
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,720
so we have to find other ways to

621
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,400
provide it for all

622
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,799
which is the topic of our working group

623
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,720
okay so i think um

624
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,000
i just

625
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
can you

626
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,200
please give us like uh

627
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,039
ideas about what

628
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,559
how we can translate

629
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,080
what is the space of the possible what

630
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,919
is the space of the uh

631
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,360
feasible so we can in future discussions

632
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,000
talk about concrete proposals that

633
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,679
might help to

634
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,760
get there or close to there

635
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,279
okay

636
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,760
thank you very much

637
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,158
thank you

638
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,799
um we um we don't have mark on the

639
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,840
um that has mark hasn't joined us yet

640
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,559
so i think we'll go up next with um

641
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,840
mitchuki

642
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,600
mitsuki monkey

643
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,159
from the internet society

644
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,919
muchuki's presentation is on

645
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,480
sustainability for community networks

646
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,120
mitsuki if you're ready we'll give you

647
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,360
um 20 minutes for your prez and then

648
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,559
we'll have q and a after

649
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,240
over to you

650
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
thank you jin i

651
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,840
trust you can hear me

652
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,480
we can hear you okay all right good um

653
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,400
thank you and good morning good

654
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,240
afternoon and good evening depending on

655
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
where you are my name is amichi kimangi

656
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,320
from the internet society

657
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,840
and today i would like to um

658
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,400
cover a topic that

659
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,559
has been is increasingly becoming of

660
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,799
interest to us based on some of the work

661
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,120
that we do with respect to

662
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,159
making community networks sustainable

663
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,960
so maybe i'll just give some background

664
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,200
around why this issue has come to our

665
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
attention and what we are hoping to be

666
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,840
able to accomplish with it by providing

667
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,960
some background so maybe the next slide

668
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,200
yeah not this

669
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,000
um so the

670
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,559
rationale behind community networks is

671
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,960
basically brought on with by the fact

672
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,880
that there is an existing connectivity

673
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,720
challenge which exists

674
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,520
where

675
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
nearly 3 billion people are still

676
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,039
offline

677
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,840
and

678
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,799
the existing business

679
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,640
traditional business models that are

680
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,960
used to connect people

681
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
around the world tend not to scale

682
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
enough to connect those in rural remote

683
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
and underserved areas

684
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,880
and as we've seen in the last two years

685
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,520
there's been a major highlighting of the

686
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,320
connectivity gap especially when

687
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,799
situations require people to

688
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,600
try and transition to using connectivity

689
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,279
as a way of keeping life going on um

690
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,480
when

691
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,720
under circumstances such as lockdowns

692
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,120
and so on and we've seen the impact that

693
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,919
has had especially in emerging markets

694
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,279
where

695
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,640
people don't have access at home and so

696
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,159
usage has gone down and we've had

697
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,919
you know countries and

698
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,679
communities and enterprises trying to

699
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,600
scramble and come up with

700
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,360
innovative ways to try and get people

701
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,679
connected during the height of the

702
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,120
pandemic

703
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,200
and so as we are trying to find more

704
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,399
solutions to get more people connected

705
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,559
and one of the key things that's going

706
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,799
to be

707
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,279
important for us to answer is how to

708
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,960
keep these community networks or the

709
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,679
solutions that we identify to be

710
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,960
sustainable

711
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,840
so moving on to the next slide

712
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,279
so community networks are

713
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,399
one of those complementary solutions

714
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,200
that

715
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,559
have emerged

716
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,000
and

717
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,640
is making an impact with respect to

718
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,440
uh

719
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,960
how they operate because they are built

720
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,039
by and for the communities that they

721
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,559
serve so they have a bottom-up approach

722
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,840
um they are complementary in that they

723
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,159
basically

724
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,039
are built in locations where

725
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,159
the

726
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,720
economics for the traditional operators

727
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,480
don't really work well

728
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,600
and so they complement where traditional

729
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
operators are unable to go for various

730
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,880
reasons

731
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,960
and also they largely rely on the

732
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
community and the local champions that

733
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,720
exist in those areas to try and um make

734
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,919
them

735
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,240
sort of be more um

736
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
resilient to the challenges that the

737
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
traditional business most deals are

738
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,559
likely to face and so the bottom up

739
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,279
approach tends to uh building those

740
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,360
resiliency factors that are needed to

741
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,120
make them sustainable in their

742
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,000
respective environments

743
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,559
so going on to the next slide i wanted

744
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,760
to talk about

745
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,520
how those community networks are

746
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,679
designed they take to

747
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,960
look at

748
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,399
various

749
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,240
approaches

750
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,520
first they will

751
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
suddenly vary in sizes

752
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,080
depending on the

753
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,919
the community they are trying to serve

754
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,200
they could be as

755
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,720
big as 50 000 subscribers or more like

756
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,000
wifi

757
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,919
um in in

758
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,720
in barcelona and it could be as few as

759
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,559
50 people

760
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,440
in a very small village

761
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,080
um they also have different setups in

762
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,559
terms of the technology that they use

763
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,919
um largely dependent on what issues they

764
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,519
are trying to solve for the community

765
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,279
that they serve

766
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,440
and they also are driven by

767
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,720
or the reasons of being established will

768
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,559
vary depending on what they're trying to

769
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,760
solve for

770
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,080
so some of them will be trying to

771
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,279
provide alternative uh most

772
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,640
more affordable

773
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,679
connectivity solutions um there could be

774
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,000
other options like 4g and so on which

775
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,679
could be out of the reach of the people

776
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,480
that

777
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,120
are in the in the area and so they're

778
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,799
looking for something alternative or

779
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,480
complementary and they are looking for

780
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,600
more less autonomy or more autonomy

781
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,120
sorry

782
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,799
and also looking to gain

783
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,240
better access

784
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,080
based on what is available we've seen

785
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,679
situations where

786
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,559
they only have 3g but

787
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,880
it's not reliable

788
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,000
people have to go to certain locations

789
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,399
in the area to just get access

790
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,279
and finally of course um

791
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,679
they also designed based on what the

792
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,840
community perceives to be the most

793
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
useful structure from a governance

794
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
perspective that will work for them

795
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,519
so

796
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,000
all community networks are basically not

797
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,679
identical

798
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,760
because of these factors

799
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,880
and

800
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,760
they but they're generally underpinned

801
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,919
if you could go to the next line by a

802
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,640
number of pillars of key things that are

803
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,200
important to them first for community

804
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,440
networks to emerge they suddenly need

805
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,840
an enabling regulatory and policy

806
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,919
framework

807
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,799
and

808
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,279
if that doesn't exist it becomes harder

809
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,600
for them to emerge

810
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,279
secondly

811
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,279
community networks will actually need

812
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,000
access to barcode and

813
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,399
without buckle then it becomes quite

814
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,240
difficult for them to

815
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,039
operate in a sustainable way or even

816
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,519
provide meaningful i mean

817
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,120
usable

818
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,519
connectivity

819
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,840
another important aspect for community

820
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,919
networks is to have knowledge and

821
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,679
know-how

822
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,399
by knowledge basically means that they

823
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,679
need to have the technical expertise

824
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,679
not just to run the network but also

825
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,600
they need some know-how on how to

826
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,840
operate a business and make it

827
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
sustainable

828
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,760
by following best practices that are

829
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,360
used in

830
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,000
in operating businesses

831
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,720
they also need to have a user base

832
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
that means they need to be able to bring

833
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
in the buying of the stakeholders or the

834
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,799
community whom they serve to be able to

835
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,320
take on this

836
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,600
service

837
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,320
and finally they also need to run

838
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,399
the entire network

839
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,720
in a sustainable manner

840
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,120
and this is going to be the focus of

841
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,440
part of the things that i like to talk

842
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,280
about going for

843
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,520
in the next few slides

844
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,639
so um if we go to the next slide we'll

845
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,800
look at the challenges that community

846
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,960
networks face and

847
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,879
we've tried to categorize this into

848
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,159
three areas

849
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,040
the financial technical and regulatory

850
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,760
the financial component being uh pretty

851
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,359
much focused on

852
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,320
um

853
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,800
the ability for community networks to

854
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,960
bootstrap from the beginning

855
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,900
to be able to

856
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,040
[Music]

857
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,119
operate sustainably

858
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,280
and also be able to grow

859
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,839
once they are sustainable so there are

860
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,399
scaling issues involved

861
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,320
there are issues to do with the initial

862
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,280
setup

863
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,679
and there are also issues to do with the

864
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,239
operating day-to-day operations

865
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,560
on the technical side it's pretty much

866
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,119
about the technology

867
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,200
uh or the technical know-how that they

868
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,000
have the expertise that they have

869
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,880
and also the tools and

870
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,040
software

871
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,680
sets available for them

872
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,520
to be able to run manage the network

873
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,760
and provide a good quality level of

874
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,880
service

875
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,720
and being able to do so at a low cost

876
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,119
and finally on the regulatory side is

877
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,920
being able to access the spectrum or

878
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,920
that they need or the resources that

879
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,760
they need to run the network

880
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
but also having an environment that

881
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,760
actually allows them to thrive and grow

882
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,359
so um for the next part i want to focus

883
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,079
on one area out of this three areas

884
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,839
under technical which is the open source

885
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,040
solutions that are really important

886
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,400
because

887
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,320
if we go on to the next slide you will

888
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,950
see that

889
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,520
[Music]

890
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
there are quite a number of tools that

891
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
exist open source the networks have

892
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,839
actually used over time

893
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,480
to manage the network to provide

894
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,720
which actually enables the network

895
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,880
operators to provide good quality

896
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,040
services

897
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,200
but we see that most of the open source

898
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,920
tools that are mature um stable and well

899
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,720
developed tend to fall in one category

900
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,760
which were

901
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
on the network management side there are

902
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,240
quite a number of really useful tools

903
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,359
that i

904
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,480
well utilized both in

905
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,960
medium and large networks

906
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,079
and

907
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,240
that works really well and that's also

908
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,320
easy because they've matured to a level

909
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,400
that it's easy for them to be easily

910
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,680
deployed without requiring

911
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,440
in-depth knowledge

912
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,760
of you know like system and mean skills

913
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,240
and so on to just be able to deploy them

914
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,480
and use them for network monitoring

915
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,000
and and this has been really helpful

916
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,320
however when we go to the authentication

917
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,960
and accounting side or the billing side

918
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,920
then we start seeing some

919
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,000
sort of limitations

920
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,119
in terms of the tools that are available

921
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,359
open source tools that are available

922
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,359
especially when you're looking from the

923
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,760
graphical user interface side

924
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,359
um to

925
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,800
sort of support

926
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,520
some of the back-end

927
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,560
tools that already exist an example here

928
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,480
is that we've had something like free

929
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,960
radius which has been

930
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,680
widely deployed across many service

931
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,280
provider networks

932
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,920
it's very stable very reliable

933
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,760
but then when you look at the front-end

934
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,720
tools that exist to manage

935
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,680
um

936
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,760
free radius then you start seeing a

937
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,359
limitation

938
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,520
a lot of them going to the commercial or

939
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,200
the

940
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,440
i'll say the commercial side of things

941
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,640
and they're

942
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,800
not

943
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,240
entirely

944
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,560
cost friendly if i could put it that way

945
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,920
when you're looking at a community

946
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,599
network's perspective

947
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,040
part of the challenge with community

948
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,880
networks is that

949
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,760
the

950
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,520
areas that they serve may not have the

951
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,079
scale in terms of number of users

952
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,520
to be able to

953
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,079
um you know be

954
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,599
able to turn on um profitability or be

955
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,520
able to have surpluses within a very

956
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,880
short time

957
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,400
turnaround time

958
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,960
and so where commercial products will

959
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,359
sort of easily

960
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,280
support that business model the

961
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,800
community network

962
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,839
model

963
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,240
does tend to rely on a lot of donations

964
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,040
and grants and so on so the model is

965
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,880
quite different

966
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,079
so if we go on to the next slide um

967
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,480
we've tried to understand why it's

968
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,760
important

969
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,880
um

970
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,440
oh sorry i think we missed a slide there

971
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,119
um

972
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,079
so

973
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:50,880
yes

974
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,119
to understand why billing solutions are

975
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,839
important for cns

976
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,920
of course

977
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,599
not just for authentication and getting

978
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,920
people connected but for them to be able

979
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,160
to generate revenue

980
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,240
to scale their growth

981
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,200
so that

982
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,240
they can

983
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,040
expand the network to cover more people

984
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,520
and also go be

985
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,920
improve their sustainability and reduce

986
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,480
their dependence on grants and donations

987
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,320
which is basically one of the main

988
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,280
sources of which they used to deploy

989
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,640
the

990
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,680
initial phase of the community network

991
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,920
so um what are the things that we've

992
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,800
been trying to look for in our us

993
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
building solution for community networks

994
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,560
so we've tried to highlight a couple of

995
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,960
items in the next slide and

996
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,240
[Music]

997
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,000
those items uh that are key or seem to

998
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,400
be important for community networks is

999
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,160
support for the

1000
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,599
main protocols that are used uh radius

1001
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,560
ppoe l2tp and hotspots

1002
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,800
um they are suddenly looking for a

1003
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,359
simplified graphical user interface some

1004
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,839
of the tools that exist

1005
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,640
do require a high level of knowledge on

1006
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,880
assessment administration from medium to

1007
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
advanced level

1008
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,400
ease of deployment

1009
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,359
um

1010
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,000
basically um is also another thing

1011
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,599
that's needed

1012
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,480
and also the deployment on low powered

1013
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,400
hardware um

1014
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,720
most community networks especially those

1015
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,079
in rural and underserved areas tend to

1016
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,079
deal with power issues

1017
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,280
and so

1018
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,960
a lot of the equipment are low powered

1019
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,920
devices so anything that can be deployed

1020
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,240
on a simple as a raspberry pi or

1021
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,980
something similar um

1022
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,119
[Music]

1023
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,359
in terms of a low power device that will

1024
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,079
be

1025
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,760
a tool that they will be open to

1026
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,960
considering

1027
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,240
and of course

1028
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,000
some features like

1029
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,920
configurable prepaid and post paid

1030
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,839
billing

1031
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,000
packages some basic reporting

1032
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,520
and

1033
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,920
at least with some level of community

1034
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,040
support

1035
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,079
including other community networks

1036
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,079
so i'll go on to the next one and

1037
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,000
the reason why we actually looking for

1038
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,319
this is because

1039
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,319
we are looking for solutions that we can

1040
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,160
recommend to cns

1041
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,720
because this is becoming an increasing

1042
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,680
issue

1043
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,520
with respect to their sustainability

1044
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,079
we had a session earlier this year with

1045
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,560
a number of community networks and the

1046
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,240
session was about

1047
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,119
billing solutions and

1048
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,359
most of some of the questions that they

1049
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,839
ask is what are the available open

1050
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,440
source solutions that they could easily

1051
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,760
take on and deploy

1052
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,640
but they will develop commercial ones

1053
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,520
of some that have a gradual growth path

1054
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,240
but the costing model is suddenly out of

1055
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,640
reach for the current set of community

1056
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
networks that we are working with so we

1057
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,960
are certainly looking for

1058
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,440
options that we can recommend to them

1059
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,839
and uh if you go on to the next slide

1060
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,200
you'll see that we still have lots of

1061
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,760
new and

1062
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,359
existing community networks we would

1063
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,200
like to support this year

1064
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,680
certainly more over the coming years and

1065
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,560
so

1066
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,319
we'll suddenly be interested to see

1067
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,280
what's out there what's available what

1068
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,359
you've had

1069
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,480
new

1070
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,400
so that we can integrate this as well if

1071
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,800
it does require training to be able to

1072
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,480
integrate that into the training that we

1073
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,599
are offering

1074
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,440
and and also work

1075
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,280
with various stakeholders to make sure

1076
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,000
that

1077
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,839
this is an element that we're able to

1078
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,680
address

1079
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,520
and make sure that community networks

1080
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,280
are able to thrive and grow

1081
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,160
so i'll stop there and

1082
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,640
if you do have comments i'm happy to

1083
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,599
take them

1084
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,800
and any suggestions that you

1085
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,480
or recommendations that you can offer

1086
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,959
thank you so much

1087
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,880
let's see

1088
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,760
if there are i see

1089
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,599

is willing he's in the queue so

1091
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,480
not free to talk

1092
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,960
russia question

1093

okay okay

1097
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,720
no problem i see julius

1098
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,200
in the queue

1099
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,280
okay uh can you hear me

1100
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,800
yeah yeah

1101
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,880
okay so community networks were pretty

1102
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,760
well were a big hope in europe in the

1103
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,680
2000s

1104
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,720
and

1105
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
the dynamic seems to have

1106
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,920
died out

1107
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,040
uh so they still exist but there are no

1108
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,680
further developments i attribute that to

1109
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,200
the availability of cheap uh cellular

1110
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,280
internet

1111
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,200
um so what i would like to know is

1112
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,400
how big of a phenomenon our community

1113
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,960
networks in the developing world

1114
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,440
do you have any data or perhaps any

1115
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,920
anecdotal evidence that whether it's a

1116
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,760
completely minority thing or whether

1117
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,470
it's big

1118
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,660
[Music]

1119
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,599
yeah that's a good question

1120
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,720
julius

1121
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,920
so

1122
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,960
it's actually an emerging trend

1123
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,800
i would want to refer to it as an

1124
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,880
emerging trend

1125
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,880
because in

1126
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,800
many parts of the imagine world they're

1127
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,520
actually difficult to set up because of

1128
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,640
the policy and regulatory environment

1129
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
and now we're at a phase where we are

1130
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,359
seeing a number of countries

1131
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,440
that are actually taking

1132
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
a positive step

1133
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,119
to change the policy environment

1134
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,359
to allow community networks to actually

1135
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,800
be established

1136
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,079
and so

1137
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,880
some countries where the policy

1138
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,960
environment is enabling we are seeing

1139
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,560
them coming up

1140
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,760
and so

1141
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,960
through the activities that we do in our

1142
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,640
engagements with them

1143
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,440
um these are now becoming the questions

1144
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,800
that they are asking

1145
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,960
uh so that networking tools network

1146
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,960
monitoring tools are available

1147
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,000
but the billing solution tools are a bit

1148
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,160
of a challenge for them

1149
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,480
it's part of skill issue

1150
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,960
but also looking at where they are

1151
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,880
they may not be able to retain highly

1152
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,839
skilled systematic means in rural areas

1153
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,599
because the moment you develop their

1154
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,640
skills

1155
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,240
they lose the people to

1156
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,079
bigger networks that are able to pay

1157
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:54,960
more

1158
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,480
and so we're

1159
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,560
suddenly looking for tools that will be

1160
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,200
able to be low

1161
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,640
in terms of their skill level

1162
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,880
requirements not high level just medium

1163
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,560
to low to medium

1164
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,240
skill level to be able to operate and

1165
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,359
maintain those kind of systems

1166
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,400
i joined this year

1167
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,800
yeah um and just to

1168
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,599
um support what machu ki saying julius

1169
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,599
there's quite a lot of been a resurgence

1170
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,359
in the work and community and municipal

1171
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,480
networks around the world

1172
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,119
i work in that space as well and we're

1173
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,880
seeing actually an interesting

1174
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,720
resurgence in the united states believe

1175
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,839
it or not

1176
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,240
with municipal networks open source open

1177
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,118
access networks

1178
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,359
muni networks

1179
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,359
there's been an interesting

1180
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,040
there's a political dynamic here too of

1181
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,040
course where some places don't allow

1182
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,480
musical networks so you have to work

1183
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,319
with electrical co-ops

1184
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,800
so the term and that's in the u.s in 17

1185
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,960
of the 50 states there's

1186
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,560
been a lobbying force in some of the

1187
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,760
industry

1188
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,599
that went against community networks and

1189
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,599
municipal networks but you're seeing

1190
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,760
your resurgence because there's

1191
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,359
been a

1192
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,520
a keen focus on the lack of connectivity

1193
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,240
around the world as michoqui was

1194
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,400
well pointing out that there's a

1195
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,480
high cost in certain areas

1196
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,000
but we're seeing that local local

1197
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,599
resurgence we're seeing a lot of

1198
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,359
activity in places

1199
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,200
around the world from brazil to south

1200
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,480
africa to kenya to revise licensing

1201
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,720
to revise access to spectrum

1202
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,079
um tribal communities in the united

1203
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,920
states didn't have access to spectrum

1204
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,160
right for many many years

1205
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,640
on their own terms and their own uh

1206
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,760
licensing

1207
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,000
mechanisms so you're seeing changes

1208
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,520
brazil liberalized the entire six

1209
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,400
gigahertz band um to be unlicensed so

1210
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,079
that there could be more network

1211
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,960
activity at that local level to have

1212
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,480
more networks um

1213
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,640
come in these are not insignificant

1214
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,319
networks um

1215
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,960
in any event there's lots out there and

1216
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,280
there's some um new work being done on

1217
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,520
on the business models so uh to point

1218
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
out the focus that was talking about on

1219
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,720
the costs

1220
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,480
and how to look at different business

1221
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,040
models and for sustainability factors

1222
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,040
so stay tuned there's a lot of good data

1223
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,160
out there on the resurgence in muni and

1224
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,319
community and other small networks i

1225
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,040
guess you could call them

1226
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,640
non-traditional operators

1227
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,440
thank you jane

1228
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,520
i'm also on thecube also to comment

1229
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,720
about this topic

1230
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,000
but i think

1231
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,880
the

1232
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,800
importance of focusing on community

1233
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,480
networks is that

1234
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,359
there must be other business models than

1235
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,240
the operator model the for profit model

1236
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,800
because simply there are places where

1237
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,280
there is no economic margin for to

1238
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,000
attract uh the operator models

1239
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,119
but it there is already a lot of social

1240
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,000
margin to benefit the community from

1241
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,559
connectivity and then

1242
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,640
if there is a way that uh

1243
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,599
that a community a collective can

1244
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,200
get connectivity

1245
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,240
um

1246
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,480
when uh individual connectivity is not

1247
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,319
viable

1248
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,280
that is in the core of community

1249
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,680
networks and in fact um

1250
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,559
it is sometimes mentioned as very big

1251
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,400
but it is started

1252
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,559
and it continues to be

1253
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,000
a federation of local initiatives

1254
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,559
shared locally

1255
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,400
would come to right time connectivity

1256
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,680
the numbers are changing but for

1257
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,680
instance in the last

1258
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,160
european broadband awards

1259
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,079
there are three

1260
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,000
nominees from from spain to the to the

1261
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,040
award

1262
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,200
one is

1263
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,520
it's a regional

1264
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,440
open network operator

1265
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,119
that is a

1266
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,559
really useful

1267
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,160
infrastructure

1268
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,319
enabling widespread connectivity and the

1269
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,400
other r2 community network initiatives

1270
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,480
from which are part of giving it but

1271
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,359
which are based on on community fire

1272
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,319
again a a remote

1273
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,640
valley in a place where operators are

1274
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,640
not interested to go but

1275
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,599
but citizens can deploy their own fiber

1276
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:28,880
and then of course connect at the

1277
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,839
wholesale um

1278
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,599
backhoe connection

1279
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,480
so

1280
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,640
so this collective connectivity is it's

1281
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,440
um

1282
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,200
it's an important element and what

1283
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,920
michoud mentioned it's in general the

1284
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,760
the tragedy of the

1285
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,920
of free open

1286
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,000
software um

1287
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
sometimes they call it software commons

1288
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,400
and then in community networks there are

1289
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,400
interesting examples like libre router

1290
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,839
or libra server

1291
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,119
in which uh

1292
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,280
well there is a struggle to find uh

1293
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,079
funds to keep the developers uh

1294
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,839
and and benefit

1295
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,599
many communities that without that

1296
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,599
software and those tools they will not

1297
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,040
be able to really

1298
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,960
set up a viable sustainable

1299
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,079
network both in technology

1300
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,960
wise and also in economic terms

1301
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,960
so so thank you for focusing on this

1302
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,280
topic

1303
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,359

i'm happy to be here i'm vesna i work

1323
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,680
for rypncc as a community builder

1324
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,640
yes so uh yeah next slide so this

1325
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,559
presentation uh is uh going to uh well

1326
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,480
normally it's uh

1327
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,880
the the content is mostly about the

1328
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,720
traditional internet and the

1329
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,640
infrastructure but

1330
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,079
my focus will be on people because uh

1331
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,400
this is uh uh who is

1332
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,880
mostly impacted with the war which is uh

1333
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,880
going on in ukraine

1334
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,720
so it's about the resilience of the

1335
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,400
infrastructure but it's also about the

1336
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,599
resilience of people who are impacted

1337
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,559
next slide please

1338
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,920
and i'm speaking here on behalf of my

1339
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,800
colleagues who had done a lot of work in

1340
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,640
documenting what is happening with the

1341
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,599
networks in ukraine uh you can see here

1342
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,839
their photos emile aban is a data

1343
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,800
scientist and here he's pictured as

1344
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,960
measuring the internet

1345
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,920
um

1346
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,640
he couldn't be here today because he's

1347
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,640
working on the next analysis which will

1348
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,359
be

1349
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:46,480
about the

1350
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,440
um

1351
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,680
impact or like how does the

1352
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,720
russian

1353
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,599
internet infrastructure is weathering

1354
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,960
the the war and and also because

1355
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,680
his two sons are having their birthday

1356
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,880

00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,640
and with all the other people impacted

1371
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,240
with the war next

1372
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,720
so the all the information and the links

1373
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,640
and the graphs

1374
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,079
you can find in the articles the uh my

1375
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,400
talk today will mostly be about

1376
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,599
the

1377
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,440
most recent article which is about the

1378
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,960
resilience of the internet so actually

1379
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,079
um

1380
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,880
looking at the infrastructure after the

1381
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,119
three weeks of the war

1382
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,799
and then there will be a little bit

1383
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,119
about the outages which is described in

1384
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,960
the previous article which was about the

1385
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,880
beginning of the war

1386
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,359
if you are curious about how the

1387
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,440
internet used to look like in 2019 uh

1388
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,960
then there are also slides from uh alex

1389
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,599
that he gave at another conference and

1390
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,079
you can also access them through here

1391
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,520
and my

1392
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,200
work was about

1393
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,000
the resilience of the networkers during

1394
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,839
the covet pandemic

1395
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,559
and it is still very relevant that we

1396
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,880
need to take care of each other and take

1397
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,200
care of our needs of our physical health

1398
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,319
mental health and human connections and

1399
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,040
not only uh making sure that the network

1400
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,000
connections are working

1401
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,720
next

1402
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,799
so uh the uh elements that i'm going to

1403
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,920
cover in a little bit more detail

1404
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,079
so the first of all as i said the human

1405
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,640
connections and dedication of the

1406
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,400
network operators

1407
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,640
in ukraine and their courage and

1408
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,799
perseverance in staying in the country

1409
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,839
and doing their work and fixing the

1410
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,480
infrastructure

1411
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,599
then the two next elements are the um

1412
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:23,839
decentralization of their market of the

1413
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,079
internet service providers

1414
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:27,200
and then

1415
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,839
a presence of large amount of uh

1416
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,000
internet exchange points

1417
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,920
then there was um

1418
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,839
uh there is also something that we

1419
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,000
didn't cover too much but you can see it

1420
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,839
also following this link

1421
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,680
which is uh the

1422
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,880
interconnection of ukraine as a country

1423
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,240
to the transit providers

1424
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,960
and that has been measured by the

1425
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,640
internet health report a project that

1426
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,799
is independent from the ripe ncc but

1427
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,559
it's still using the data from the ripe

1428
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:59,680
ncc

1429
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,440
and then there's also a work from other

1430
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,599
organizations like telegeography that

1431
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,079
shows the existence of the fiber

1432
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,160
connections of okra into the rest of the

1433
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,520
world

1434
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,400
next please so about the

1435
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,319
decentralization

1436
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:20,160
so this graph uh shows this graph is

1437
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,440
actually based on the ripe atlas and

1438
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,359
a short introduction to what the ripe

1439
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:29,040
atlas is this is a measurement project

1440
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,160
that is now older than 10 years by the

1441
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,599
ripe ncc

1442
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,240
it consists of

1443
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,640
10 000 and more

1444
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,440
hardware devices and in the last three

1445
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,160
years also software probes the hardware

1446
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,640
devices are hosted in the people's

1447
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,440
houses and data centers

1448
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,240
uh so at the edges of the network and

1449
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,480
also close to the infrastructure and

1450
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,359
they do continuous pings trace routes

1451
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,000
dns lookups and few other measurements

1452
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,359
towards

1453
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,000
root name servers and we collect this

1454
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,200
data

1455
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,280
and publish it as an open data that

1456
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,160
anybody can analyze and we also do a lot

1457
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,160
of analysis

1458
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,440
ourselves

1459
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,040
and also all the hosts that are

1460
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,520
providing the connectivity and

1461
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,760
electricity to these small devices in

1462
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,200
their locations

1463
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,079
they

1464
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,880
can use the other 10 000 probes to

1465
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,720
perform their own measurements and that

1466
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,079
also adds to the open data

1467
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,280
so this is

1468
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,839
a great project however it has its

1469
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,799
limitations because it's only measuring

1470
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,359
where like the lowest layers of the

1471
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,640
infrastructure

1472
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,799
and because we don't do the http

1473
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,799
measurement so we don't measure the web

1474
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,400
we really measure only the internet

1475
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,240
connectivity

1476
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,440
and so

1477
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,880
um at some point emil created this

1478
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,520
kind of overlay on top of this atlas

1479
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,280
measurements and analysis which is

1480
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,319
called

1481
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,880
a country jedi

1482
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,240
and so he created a mesh measurement

1483
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,880
between all the probes within every

1484
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,000
country and so you can see how are the

1485
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,280
end users reaching each other and what

1486
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,839
uh those paths traverse

1487
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,720
so on this circle he

1488
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,480
um

1489
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,880
visualizes only the

1490
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,440
companies that have more than one

1491
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,200
percent of the user base

1492
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,880
uh within that country so uh here you

1493
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,119
can see that that actually only

1494
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,040
visualizes 45

1495
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,040
of all the companies which means

1496
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,880
there is another 55 percent which is not

1497
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,559
visualized which are really really small

1498
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,079
providers

1499
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,720
and so the the strong the the green ones

1500
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,359
are where we do have ripatis probes and

1501
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,599
the other ones we actually don't have

1502
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,880
covered and so this is a call for the

1503
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,960
people from other countries to actually

1504
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,799
deploy these devices if you are

1505
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,880
interested in the measurements about

1506
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,880
your own country

1507
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,079
and so

1508
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,480
uh this is like a technical

1509
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,040
side but then he also looked into the

1510
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,680
economy and the market and he looked

1511
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,480
into something called hh index which

1512
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,559
stands for two very difficult names

1513
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,040
which i'm not going to pronounce

1514
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,720
and so based on this index ukraine is

1515
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,520
the fourth in the world so

1516
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,119
there is

1517
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,599
very little market concentration in

1518
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,400
other words the the market is very very

1519
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,559
decentralized so that makes it very

1520
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,839
resilient because if one provider is

1521
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,680
impacted then

1522
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,319
the the traffic can move to the

1523
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,880
all the other providers

1524
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,839
and so this sounds like really great but

1525
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,559
still it makes me really sad to think

1526
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,520
that this resilience had to be tested

1527
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,480
and that these providers are still going

1528
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,400
offline because of the war so it's

1529
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,559
really hard to talk about this in this

1530
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:07,680
kind of

1531
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,839
cold

1532
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,680
technological terms while that actually

1533
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,079
means that there are people there

1534
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,280
being

1535
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,799
hurt

1536
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:21,759
but yes let's move on to the next slide

1537
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,119
okay so this is uh

1538
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,280
also super interesting i didn't know

1539
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,079
this about ukraine before uh

1540
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,400
we started doing this analysis

1541
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,720
and that is that they have

1542
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,280
19 internet exchange points so that's a

1543
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,359
really a very large number

1544
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,319
um and that those are uh the internet

1545
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,760
exchange points registered in the

1546
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,280
peering db uh however ipotless only sees

1547
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,359
13 of them

1548
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,160
and so we have this other project that

1549
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,920
emil created which is ixp country jedi

1550
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,799
and so again this is a probe mesh and it

1551
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,480
shows the paths

1552
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,319
uh and it shows like do they traverse an

1553
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:08,799
internet exchange point and do they stay

1554
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,480
within a country so that's a different

1555
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,039
visualization which you can find if you

1556
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,000
follow

1557
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,920
on the slides

1558
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,119
and so there is 13 of them

1559
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,280
and they're all differently color coded

1560
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,160
so you can see that there is quite a

1561
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,640
uh like diversity of colors on this

1562
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,520
graph and so that means also there isn't

1563
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,240
one dominant internet exchange point

1564
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,720
like all of them are very much in use

1565
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,640
and they provide a lot of

1566
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,960
interconnectivity

1567
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,359
and um

1568
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,160
oh okay the the last part of the slide

1569
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,559
is uh is a mistake so ignore that so can

1570
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,839
we go to the next one

1571
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,799
yeah so now we go to the a little bit

1572
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,599
less positive outcomes

1573
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,160
of of our analysis so you could see the

1574
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,720
damage that uh that the at the beginning

1575
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,920
of the war uh the infrastructure had uh

1576
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,680
uh experienced

1577
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,440
and so this is uh one of the providers

1578
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,760
and this is uh like we have

1579
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,960
had 15 probes there and then a lot of

1580
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,799
them got disconnected

1581
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,960
and slowly went up after a while and

1582
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,359
yeah you can you can read more details

1583
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,119
and see it for yourself if you follow

1584
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,599
the links in the uh article which is in

1585
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,599
this page

1586
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,200
and the next slide please

1587
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,079
so uh again the

1588
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,319
bottom slide shows um

1589
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,480
or the decrease over time

1590
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,440
of the number of connected probes

1591
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,559
but uh

1592
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,200
as i said we are mostly focused on the

1593
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,599
on the physical infrastructure and so

1594
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,520
for uh the mobile connectivity we have

1595
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:01,039
portrait data from cloudflare and you

1596
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:03,520
could also see there that the people

1597
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,599
when they started moving away from their

1598
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,599
houses traveling as

1599
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,839
escaping as refugees

1600
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,599
or um

1601
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,559
just uh yeah the houses got destroyed

1602
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,440
then

1603
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,000
connectivity moved more to the mobile

1604
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,720
connections

1605
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,920
next slide please

1606
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:28,240
yes so uh there was uh uh other people

1607
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,559
reporting on what is happening in in

1608
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,480
ukraine and again this is more of a

1609
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,599
human

1610
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,119
uh aspect

1611
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,200
so um

1612
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,240
they were

1613
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,200
julian oliver commented on emil's

1614
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,240
article

1615
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,839
on twitter that

1616
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:47,280
it it takes diversity and solidarity to

1617
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,400
to keep the internet up and running

1618
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,400
and then there are other people who are

1619
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,880
situated in ukraine who who share the

1620
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,880
photos of how the physical

1621
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,640
infrastructure is being um

1622
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,480
repaired and how the competitors help

1623
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,480
each other so it's um yeah it's more

1624
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,359
than the market forces that that make

1625
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,359
these people want to keep their

1626
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:17,119
customers connected it is uh yeah

1627
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,119
they're understanding how important the

1628
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,839
internet is in the in the lives of

1629
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:22,799
people

1630
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,960
to stay connected to their families and

1631
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,440
to receive the news so they are helping

1632
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,400
each other even if they are competitors

1633
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,839
uh in a commercial sense

1634
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,880
and i think i have only two more slides

1635
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,200
so this is um

1636
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,960
an initiative

1637
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,440
created by uh

1638
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,480
nog alliance network operators group

1639
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,000
group

1640
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,240
they uh started

1641
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,480
collecting equipment and and and

1642
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,200
monetary donations to help the network

1643
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,680
operators in ukraine and they got in

1644
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,559
touch with them so they are really

1645
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,000
knowing specifically which equipment

1646
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,880
which tools are needed and where

1647
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,599
and so shipping them from

1648
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,039
western europe

1649
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,839
uh towards the border and then being met

1650
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:20,640
there with the operators in the country

1651
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,119
and uh yeah distributing the equipment

1652
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,960
which which has been damaged so if you

1653
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,280
would like to help and you are a techie

1654
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,079
you can yeah you can check it out how

1655
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,359
this works and if you are interested in

1656
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,880
some other way of helping like with

1657
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,640
more like community building and

1658
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,440
humanitarian help uh in amsterdam and in

1659
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,119
holland we have a lot of initiatives so

1660
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,839
you can get in touch with

1661
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:47,920
me on the other hand um

1662
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,559
i really have to get out of this frame

1663
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,079
of mind of like uh charity and help in

1664
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,319
that sense because as you can see on the

1665
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:58,319
quote on the next slide

1666
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:01,760
it's not about being um

1667
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,799
like getting there and helping it's

1668
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:09,280
about mutual aid and solidarity because

1669
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,799
our uh

1670
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,440
our liberation our revolution as

1671
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,280
alejandro said depends on all of us uh

1672
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,599
being

1673
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,920
helping each other so what is happening

1674
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,440
in ukraine

1675
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,480
is

1676
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,359
happening in many many other places and

1677
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,400
i also speak as somebody coming from ex

1678
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,039
yugoslavia the country that has also

1679
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,760
caused the wars and suffered the wars

1680
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,310
and

1681
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,599
[Music]

1682
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,200
went through the disconnections of the

1683
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,200
internet and fight for the open

1684
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,559
communication

1685
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,520
so we are working on all of this

1686
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,079
together and today

1687
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,000
the report is about the resilience of

1688
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,400
ukrainian internet but

1689
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,920
it could be

1690
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,280
about

1691
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,280
your country next it was about my

1692
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,640
country 20 years ago and so

1693
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,400
let's work together

1694
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,799

1714
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,158
slides ah perfect okay so we're good

1715
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:57,279
there

1716
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,839
rajiv

1717
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,719
um i'm based here in india and

1718
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:19,279
we have over 2000 ixps

1719
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:20,960
at a larger scale and the number of

1720
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,679
smaller scale ixps

1721
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:24,960
one thing that i

1722
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,120
would be interested to understand if you

1723
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,679
have any thoughts on it is how much

1724
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:32,080
interconnect was there

1725
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,198
across isps inter exchange points

1726
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:36,560
themselves

1727
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,719
okay so in other words how closely did

1728
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:42,080
the ixps themselves collaborate versus

1729
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,399
uh you know

1730
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,040
in

1731
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,359
cases where individual isps are

1732
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,679
connected to multiple exchanges

1733
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,520
here in india it's very common for even

1734
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,400
a small to medium isp to sometimes have

1735
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,560
two different uh hearings with two

1736
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,840
different

1737
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,760
ixps but the ixp's themselves don't seem

1738
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,280
to have as much

1739
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,840
uh interest in peering across

1740
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,000
their uh you know

1741
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,640
infrastructure

1742
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,640
so i don't know

1743
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,719
what you knew about that

1744
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,120
dynamic in the uk

1745
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,080
yes i don't have any extra information

1746
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,239
about that but i think in general

1747
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:27,520
probably somebody else is

1748
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,040
more

1749
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,719
authoritative to give that answer

1750
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,000
yeah i see yeah that the ixps do not

1751
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,320
really connect with each other they are

1752
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,040
there to connect the networks that in

1753
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,320
the only exception here in india is we

1754
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,760
have a

1755
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,960
a state sponsored or

1756
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,800
government-sponsored isp group called

1757
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,360
nixi the national inter exchange of

1758
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,280
india which has

1759
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,360
you know plans to bring up at least a

1760
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,960
dozen inter exchange points and

1761
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,040
all of them are interconnected though

1762
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,760
they don't have as much penetration and

1763
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,880
connectivity with local isps as the

1764
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,480
commercial ix points do

1765
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,440
so is there is there an equivalent is

1766
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,440
there a state-sponsored or

1767
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,320
a government-run ixp network in the uk

1768
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,920
i believe that there isn't i think that

1769
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,679
these are all like uh uh individual uh

1770
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,120
ixps

1771
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,760
uh and uh if you uh okay i will i will

1772
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,600
put this link in there so like

1773
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,239
jedi.tribe.net

1774
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:43,679
there you can actually go and see uh in

1775
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,600
more detail the names of all of these

1776
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,920
isps and

1777
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,679
also a different

1778
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,400
visualization this one yeah

1779
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,480
shows

1780
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,679
like them

1781
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,679
uh each one individually but then we

1782
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,320
have another one which shows

1783
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,440
um how the

1784
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,440
what is the percentage of all the probes

1785
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,280
that go through any ixp but note

1786
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,600
what you're asking for because i think

1787
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,040
that is

1788
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,880
not usually the case like how do they

1789
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,520
connect to each other

1790
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,360
okay i just thought that might be

1791
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,679
interesting to know thank you

1792
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,159

1793
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,239

do you hear us

1819
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,600
perhaps we could put up dimitri's slides

1820
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,679
and we can figure out how to make sure

1821

speak so dmitry you have to ask to

1823
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:50,080
get you in the queue

1824
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,679
yeah we don't have a slice because well

1825
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,520
dimitri said that he would use his

1826
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,679
browser to show

1827
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,280

which should be quite interesting the

1871
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,960
second speaker is from witness which is

1872
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,159
a

1873
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,600
ngo

1874
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,679
based in new york it's been around for

1875
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,880
30 plus years that does media

1876
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,360
um alternative media activism and they

1877
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:37,280
are presenting on the c2pa standard i'm

1878
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,719
not going to remember the acronym at

1879
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,840
this stage in the morning but c2pa is an

1880
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,800
effort um it's an association coalition

1881
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,719
effort led by adobe to um at sort of a

1882
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,480
bare minimum update exif data for images

1883
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,280
but at you know the ideal is actually to

1884
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,159
create

1885
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,440
um

1886
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,000
some manifest uh

1887
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,120
i guess

1888
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,600
documentation of where images originate

1889
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,080
so it's about trust in

1890
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,800
media sources so that'll also be

1891
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,719
interesting because it's a you know as

1892
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,719
as we know from certificate authorities

1893
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,320
and things like that trust

1894
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,719
in the digital landscape is hard and

1895
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,239
doesn't always mean

1896
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:19,280
um

1897
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,960
what we think it means so those are the

1898
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,480
two and then of course we have our work

1899
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,400
items for the group we'll be talking

1900
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,600
about

1901
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,199
guidelines

1902
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:28,480
for

1903
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,560
reviewers and

1904
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,320
authors of

1905
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,840
internet drafts and the ietf and the

1906
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,440
irtf on

1907
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,840
human rights protocol considerations and

1908
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,920
how they can action those

1909
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,840
we'll also be talking about draft

1910
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,600
association which looks at freedom of

1911
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,360
expression and

1912
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,159
protocols and then

1913
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,719
we have a presentation

1914
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,199
from the authors of the zero zero draft

1915
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,679
on ip blocking that's also being

1916
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,480
discussed today in int area

1917
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,679
so for those who miss the end area

1918
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:04,000
presentation you can come to hrpc and i

1919
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,440
imagine that the

1920
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,080
quality of the discussion on

1921
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,159
can censorship be a good thing question

1922
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:13,360
mark will be an interesting one for sure

1923
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,440

i'm the founding director of an

1979
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,440
organization called equality

1980
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,280
we develop technology solutions for the

1981
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,120
promotion and protection of human rights

1982
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,519
online

1983
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,639
and i guess i can just launch into it

1984
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:21,639

1985
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:26,000

01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,000
okay thank you so just very briefly

1988
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,440
some of the qualities projects include

1989
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,600
ddos mitigation infrastructure such as

1990
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,520
deflect

1991
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,639
and

1992
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,800
technology to circumvent internet

1993
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,199
censorship such as the sino project

1994
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:50,480
and the suno project

1995
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,440
uses uh decentralized networking is

1996
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,360
built on return protocols and allows

1997
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,679
people not only to

1998
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:59,600
um

1999
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,840
request content which may otherwise be

2000
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,639
censored in a particular network

2001
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:07,440
but thereafter it allows people to share

2002
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,360
this content with each other

2003
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,000
peer-to-peer

2004
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,080
and i'm talking about this project

2005
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,480
because it has a relevance to the

2006
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,678
presentation later on

2007
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,880
apart from doing technology we've also

2008
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,440
been involved for many years in digital

2009
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,239
security capacity building

2010
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,800
basically working with

2011
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,120
civil society media

2012
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,719
human arts organizations around the

2013
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,239
world

2014
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:39,120
lifting awareness of existing digital

2015
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,440
security risks

2016
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,480
and

2017
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,600
bringing the resources and capability

2018
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,360
in order to mitigate these risks

2019
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,000
um one of the ways we have found to be

2020
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,560
effective to do this work is to set up

2021
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,120
permanent learning centers

2022
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:01,040
digital security schools so to say

2023
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,199
and one of the schools was set up in

2024
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,520
kiev in ukraine

2025
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,920
back in 2016.

2026
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,840
it's called the digital security school

2027
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,360
380.

2028
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,679
[Music]

2029
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:15,920
this school has worked with

2030
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,280
local media

2031
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,560
and various types of civil society

2032
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,520
for many years now

2033
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,560
and was one of the reasons

2034
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,600
um

2035
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,840
why

2036
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,320
the organization myself personally

2037
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,120
uh

2038
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,960
were interested in what was happening in

2039
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,440
ukraine

2040
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,840
um during the last several years

2041
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,000
now

2042
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,000
as

2043
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,440
the russian army was amassing its troops

2044
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,799
around the ukrainian border

2045
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,880
and

2046
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,400
i'm sure many people around the world

2047
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,360
were

2048
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,280
considering how to help

2049
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,440
in this particular situation

2050
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,559
and we were as well

2051
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:09,520
and it felt that remotely

2052
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,600
um

2053
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,600
in expectation of what was to come

2054
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,280
we imagined a battlefield scenario

2055
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,159
whereby

2056
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,560
a prolonged period of invasion would

2057
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,880
lead to

2058
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,719
destruction of

2059
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,239
also

2060
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:31,840
destruction of

2061
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:35,280
internet infrastructure

2062
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,320
whether this was through

2063
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,480
bombing activity

2064
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:44,560
or some sort of malicious action against

2065
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,639
concrete

2066
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:50,760
internet exchanges in ukraine

2067
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,360
the scenario that we were envisioning

2068
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,320
were certain segments of the ukrainian

2069
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,000
network

2070
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,199
being disconnected from others

2071
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:03,280
and therefore people

2072
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,480
finding themselves in this areas

2073
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,920
being disconnected from the rest of the

2074
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,320
incident

2075
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,760
i went to ukraine to

2076
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,520
begin researching

2077
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,800
and conducting conversations

2078
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,199
on how true

2079
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,040
or how realistic

2080
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,159
the scenario could be

2081
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,719
what i understood and what you probably

2082
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:34,000
saw from the previous presentation is

2083
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,719
that ukraine

2084
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:38,800
presents a very

2085
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,840
varied and a very full

2086
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,760
market of

2087
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,719
both internet service providers

2088
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:47,679
and

2089
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,840
connectivity with the outside world

2090
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,400
most

2091
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,320
people who i spoke with were also

2092
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,800
concerned by the possible risk of

2093
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,040
certain disconnections

2094
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,120
however internet service providers were

2095
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,520
quite confident that

2096
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,199
um

2097
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:10,159
the variety of connectivity

2098
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:15,040
should be sufficient to withstand um

2099
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,960
most attempts

2100
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,920
against the network

2101
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,560
however

2102
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,280
what was

2103
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:31,199
quite obvious when studying um

2104
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:33,679
the network in ukraine was that

2105
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:36,239
quite a lot of

2106
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:41,280
reliance was built on certain ixps

2107
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,000
um being available being online

2108
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,159
particularly in kiev

2109
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:49,360
and also when you live

2110
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,040
and it felt that

2111
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,639
other cities

2112
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:56,880
such

2113
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:06,400
may become isolated during prolonged

2114
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,879
military activity

2115
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:15,679
and uh unfortunately this did happen

2116
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:18,159
and it's continuing to happen

2117
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:19,520
in various

2118
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,320
uh

2119
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:24,080
towns and cities of ukraine

2120
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,920
um here in the screen

2121
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,159
you can see provide us

2122
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:30,799
from um

2123
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:33,920
um

2124
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,440
i'm not sure how you can see these

2125
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,440
photos

2126
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,120
fixing internet cables connecting this

2127
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,639
town to kiev into the ixp in kiev

2128
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,239
after

2129
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:48,159
a bombing had destroyed

2130
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:51,799
some of the cable infrastructure

2131
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:01,199
now the problem with

2132
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:02,560
a network

2133
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,480
losing connectivity to other networks of

2134
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,360
course is that most people using

2135
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,199
the internet today rely on centralized

2136
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:10,639
services

2137
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,880
and communications

2138
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,199
based on the fact that services such as

2139
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,760
whatsapp or telegram

2140
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,199
or other

2141
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:22,719
well-known services are available

2142
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:24,800
however

2143
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,120
having spent

2144
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,120
a couple of decades

2145
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:32,400
working in the field of

2146
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:34,960
open source

2147
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,360
solutions and

2148
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,920
decentralized communications

2149
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,520
uh what we knew is that

2150
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,920
this

2151
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,480
is not a necessity you know connectivity

2152
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,560
to the global internet is not a

2153
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,080
precursor for

2154
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,080
being able to continue communications

2155
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,199
with

2156
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,639
other people

2157
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:59,840
in your region in your town

2158
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,199
so what we decided to do

2159
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:04,080
was

2160
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,440
stand up a network of decentralized

2161
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,638
communication servers

2162
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,840
i'm going to change this page to english

2163
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,880
basically source

2164
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,880
and procure

2165
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,320
machines with as many

2166
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,560
internet service providers who were

2167
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,000
offering hosting

2168
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,800
in various uh ukrainian cities

2169
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,520
now this was actually a little bit

2170
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,000
harder than i expected and i think we

2171
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,719
find this more and more

2172
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:47,120
in countries around the world where

2173
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,960
not only connectivity but a lot of the

2174
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,719
data centers are concentrated

2175
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:56,000
in a few big cities in a few sort of

2176
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,800
central points around the country i

2177
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,159
think it was

2178
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,880
kind of similar situation in ukraine

2179
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,400
even though there were several thousand

2180
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:08,638
isps providing last leg connectivity

2181
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,760
it was difficult to find

2182
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,040
data centers outside of

2183
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,040
a few major cities

2184
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,679
in ukraine

2185
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,120
nevertheless we define these servers

2186
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,400
and basically what we did was to

2187
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,199
use existing

2188
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:31,440
tools and protocols

2189
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,400
that allowed for

2190
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,080
federated and decentralized

2191
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,080
communications

2192
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,000
basically each of the servers

2193
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
offers

2194
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,040
matrix services

2195
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,920
and we provide

2196
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,000
web access using

2197
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,679
the element desktop

2198
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:07,560
capability also via element app

2199
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,480
a delta chat server which is an

2200
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:17,520
encrypted messaging service using smtp

2201
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,760
another

2202
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:23,840
federated and decentralized protocol

2203
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,120
and then other tools that work in close

2204
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:30,000
proximity to each other such as briar

2205
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,080
which offers mesh networking

2206
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:35,040
capabilities mesh messaging capabilities

2207
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,840
over bluetooth

2208
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:39,840
and

2209
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,760
web browsing tools

2210
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,760
one of our tools as well

2211
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,199
cno

2212
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:48,080
which allows people

2213
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,600
to access web content

2214
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,800
that is stored in a distributed cache

2215
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,159
among others we're also hoping to add

2216
01:33:58,159 --> 01:33:59,120
um

2217
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,600
so decentralized and federated social

2218
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,840
media

2219
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,400
tools

2220
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:07,120
and other chat messaging

2221
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,239
in the near future

2222
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,560
so the point of this is that anybody who

2223
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,480
is

2224
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:19,839
let's say effective

2225
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,400
can connect

2226
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,920
to the isp in kharkiv even if kharkiv

2227
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,280
itself

2228
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,719
is disconnected from the rest of the

2229
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:34,000
ukrainian network and thereby

2230
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,480
incident

2231
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,239
and in here

2232
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:43,600
they will be able to join public rooms

2233
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,480
to create private rooms

2234
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,159
and to be able to stay in touch with

2235
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:50,239
each other

2236
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,000
i'm going to show you a couple of public

2237
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,600
rooms

2238
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,119
where there are hundreds of people

2239
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,320
basically

2240
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,840
staying in touch with each other

2241
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:05,040
swapping information where

2242
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,320
bombing

2243
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,280
or other military activities is going on

2244
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,199
trying to organize

2245
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:14,400
how to get out

2246
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:18,000
trying to organize how to get supplies

2247
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,199
now by and large the

2248
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,440
specific scenario that we have stood up

2249
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,760
this infrastructure for

2250
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:30,410
has not come to pass in most areas

2251
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:31,760
[Music]

2252
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,760
in other use cases in mighty open for

2253
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,840
example where the city is cut off

2254
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,400
completely

2255
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:42,560
we weren't able to procure a server

2256
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,360
and there is conflicting information as

2257
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,440
to whether that would even be accessible

2258
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,080
because electricity has been cut

2259
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,960
to this region for

2260
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:56,600
the last three weeks

2261
01:35:57,119 --> 01:36:00,480
nevertheless this backup channel exists

2262
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,199
it exists in six and soon to be more

2263
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:04,880
locations

2264
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,880
around ukraine

2265
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,400
and people know about it so they know

2266
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,679
when to turn to it

2267
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:14,800
and

2268
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,040
people are using it actively

2269
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,560
now even

2270
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,440
when this is a backup channel

2271
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,040
and hopefully it's not something that

2272
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,119
will become

2273
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:26,159
critical

2274
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:27,679
but what is important is that it is

2275
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:29,920
there

2276
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,199
and then of course what is also

2277
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:34,480
important is that

2278
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,840
we can

2279
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,520
show

2280
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,840
and

2281
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,199
we can show

2282
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:50,320
a use case of

2283
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,920
other ways the internet can be today

2284
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,760
without reliance

2285
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,159
on specific companies

2286
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,400
to provide us the ability to communicate

2287
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,880
with each other

2288
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,880
so unfortunately

2289
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,639
or fortunately it depends i want to see

2290
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:08,239
it you know

2291
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,080
decentralized

2292
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,320
networking is

2293
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,480
a

2294
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,840
necessary technology

2295
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:22,239
for geographic areas experiencing

2296
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:25,040
various types of

2297
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,320
disaster situations

2298
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,880
now

2299
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,560
as we were developing and growing the

2300
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,960
service

2301
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,719
it had appeared or it had become

2302
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:38,159
apparent

2303
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:41,840
that the invading forces russia

2304
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,639
was also clamping down

2305
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,639
on its own network but trying to control

2306
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:50,480
uh

2307
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,280
the

2308
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,800
information the propaganda it was

2309
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,960
feeding to its own citizens there was no

2310
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,199
war

2311
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,679
and that there was no

2312
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:02,880
heavy bombing and destruction of life

2313
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,280
now in order to do this

2314
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,400
they had begun to implement

2315
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:13,440
um what is called the sovereign internet

2316
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,679
the sovereign internet is actually a

2317
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:18,480
piece of legislation

2318
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:19,920
passed

2319
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,639
several years ago in 2019

2320
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,639
that mandated the russian government and

2321
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:25,679
various

2322
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:28,480
telecommunications services to be able

2323
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,040
to disconnect from the global internet

2324
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,880
whilst maintaining

2325
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,760
the national internet function

2326
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,159
nobody

2327
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,080
really knew

2328
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,920
where the complete disconnection was

2329
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,000
possible

2330
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,040
uh but what we're seeing now is that

2331
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,880
not

2332
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,840
and other various bodies

2333
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:52,880
are

2334
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,320
moving

2335
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,960
slowly maybe not so slowly but surely

2336
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,040
towards this goal

2337
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,679
already with a huge amount

2338
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:04,080
of uh

2339
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,320
international resources

2340
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,400
including

2341
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,920
you know all of

2342
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:13,040
meta facebook instagram

2343
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,800
twitter

2344
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,119
and many other services being blocked

2345
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:19,760
for access from within russia

2346
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,159
and in reverse we've seen quite a large

2347
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:23,840
number of

2348
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,520
network carriers

2349
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,480
and

2350
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,440
various platforms

2351
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,719
blocking

2352
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:33,119
access to russians as well so we kind of

2353
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:35,760
see this disconnection on both sides

2354
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,480
of the border

2355
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,480
it became

2356
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,679
apparent to us that a similar service

2357
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:48,639
that we were building

2358
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,679
for disaster relief

2359
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,480
is also necessary in russia

2360
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,679
in order

2361
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:57,760
to allow people

2362
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,719
to communicate with each other

2363
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,320
when

2364
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,920
the sovereign incident is complete when

2365
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,480
the network has been disconnected also

2366
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,920
as a backup channel in case

2367
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,480
nothing else works

2368
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,520
um we're seeing

2369
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,719
the successful blockage of

2370
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:20,320
numerous

2371
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:24,559
popular circumvention tools and vpns

2372
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,880
um and

2373
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,360
whilst we don't hope

2374
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,040
to create

2375
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,199
a network that can support

2376
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,119
internal communications of 100 million

2377
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:37,839
people

2378
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:42,239
we do want to show

2379
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,480
an example of how this can be done

2380
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,000
and

2381
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,880
hope

2382
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,760
that people interested in doing this can

2383
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,679
replicate

2384
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:56,560
uh these services

2385
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,920
can stand up more federated instances

2386
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,639
either connected

2387
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,760
to this one um

2388
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,800
technically speaking or branding wise or

2389
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,760
completely separate

2390
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,800
in order

2391
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,800
to do this we have

2392
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,719
put the code

2393
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:25,199
that basically provisions and configures

2394
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:27,360
the various services included in this

2395
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,839
project

2396
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,480
um provision services are

2397
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,199
inside a docker swarm

2398
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:40,800
and it's relatively easy now to

2399
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,520
stand up new instances

2400
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,080
so in summary um as i was telling the

2401
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,360
andrew

2402
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:54,960
um we're not really inventing any new

2403
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,199
technology here that was the point

2404
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:58,840
of our

2405
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,960
intervention uh

2406
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,080
we had to move very quickly

2407
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:08,239
and we had to deploy existing services

2408
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:10,400
we chose

2409
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,199
messaging services that support internet

2410
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:16,559
encryption by default

2411
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:17,840
we have

2412
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:21,280
engaged numerous volunteers

2413
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:25,920
to become moderators of public rooms

2414
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,600
in matrix

2415
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,920
we have also engaged

2416
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,080
local technical people

2417
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:37,840
to be able to support this network

2418
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,239
should we lose contact

2419
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:43,199
with either one of these networks due to

2420
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:46,080
disconnections

2421
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:53,119
and we want to

2422
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:54,840
kind of plant the

2423
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,360
seed that

2424
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,040
another internet

2425
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,920
uh is possible we want to plant the seed

2426
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,679
not

2427
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:05,280
only with the tech community who already

2428
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,760
understands this

2429
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,719
uh but with average users

2430
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:12,000
which is why

2431
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,199
um

2432
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:15,520
we have created the sort of index page a

2433
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,920
way to

2434
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:21,119
enter the service

2435
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:25,839
in a interface that may be more or less

2436
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:29,280
familiar or at least

2437
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,560
non-overly complicated for normal people

2438
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,840
in

2439
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,080
who find themselves

2440
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,960
in a disconnecting network

2441
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,880
and possibly under high stress as well

2442
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:53,199
we're looking for all sorts of

2443
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:55,600
um technical

2444
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:57,520
contributions of people who are

2445
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,320
interested the code is open the project

2446
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,239
is open

2447
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:04,638
and

2448
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,600
unfortunately the times have

2449
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,800
propelled this type of technology

2450
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,040
into something which is becoming

2451
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,639
not only relevant

2452
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,440
but maybe else

2453
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:22,320
critical thank you

2454
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,159
thank you so much amitri

2455
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:25,840
it's not only that another internet is

2456
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:28,080
possible but it it seems to work

2457
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,199
and um

2458
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:31,920
and it's helping people to

2459
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,600
communities affected

2460
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,400
by the war

2461
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:39,839
let's say in all the sites

2462
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:43,840
thank you so much

2463
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,440
i don't know if there are any comments

2464
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:49,638
or questions from the audience

2465
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,800
yeah julius

2466
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,480
can go ahead

2467
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:55,330
yeah

2468
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:56,560
[Music]

2469
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,960
there have been reports which i've

2470
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,360
personally checked of

2471
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:04,880
udp of some kind of udp traffic being

2472
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:05,920
blocked

2473
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,040
between europe and russia

2474
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,520
and i couldn't find any information

2475
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,679
about who was doing the blocking do you

2476
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,840
have any information about that

2477
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:21,440
well

2478
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,320
um

2479
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,599
russia the primary body

2480
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:28,840
state

2481
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,440
mandated censorship

2482
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:35,919
or disconnections is roscommon

2483
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:40,320
now but i'm speaking about this specific

2484
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,400
occurrence that has been happening

2485
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,679
recently

2486
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:44,880
i mean

2487
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,119
blocks specific websites and specific

2488
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:51,040
but there has been wide scale blocking

2489
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,719
of certain kinds

2490
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:56,159
of udp traffic which is very confusing

2491
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:59,119
you're not aware of that are you

2492
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,840
i mean i'm aware of that happening

2493
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,320
periodically in the past

2494
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,560
and uh as i was trying to

2495
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,480
uh say that

2496
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:12,000
not also develops mandates for isps to

2497
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,320
implement various types of blocking on

2498
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,159
the

2499
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:18,719
provided infrastructure

2500
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:22,000
um so specifically i'm not i'm not sure

2501
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,679
exactly what you're referring to but

2502
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:26,080
this has been done in the past during

2503
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:28,880
okay so what is happening so if i might

2504
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,719
say just a few words what seems to be

2505
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:33,199
happening is that they are blocking

2506
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:34,880
quick handshakes

2507
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:40,080
to force http 3 to fall back to http 2.

2508
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:43,360
and nobody has any idea nobody seems to

2509
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:46,239
have any idea about why

2510
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:50,080
anyone would be interested in doing that

2511
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:51,840
okay

2512
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:54,080
i just was wondering whether you had any

2513
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,440
further information on that

2514
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,960
on on what on the why

2515
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:04,320
well that's the interesting bit

2516
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,840
so yes on the

2517
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,600
why mean look i'll just answer briefly

2518
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,320
maybe not exactly all methods of

2519
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,639
circumventing existing

2520
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:16,400
blockages

2521
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,480
are also being eliminated at the moment

2522
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:21,920
so whether they're going after doh or

2523
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:25,920
other methods of bittorrent connectivity

2524
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,080
in order to

2525
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,119
implement a severn network you have to

2526
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:33,679
eliminate all methods of getting around

2527
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:37,040
your blockages so this probably

2528
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:40,239
an extenuation of that

2529
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,960
thank you

2530
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,639
i see the jeep in the queue

2531
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:48,639
you can go ahead

2532
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:51,199
i was just saying uh probably when

2533
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:53,600
you're talking of a massive amount of

2534
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,639
udp blocking uh it's probably also

2535
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:59,679
targeted at protocols like fire guard

2536
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:01,280
which is uh

2537
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:02,400
becoming

2538
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,280
you know the vpn uh platform of choice

2539
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:08,080
for a large number of vpn providers uh

2540
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,239
you know because of its reasonably light

2541
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:11,440
footprint

2542
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,520
and uh

2543
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:16,159
i've actually seen cases where he's on

2544
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:17,679
the corporate side not on the sovereign

2545
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:20,080
side but many corporate firewall systems

2546
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:23,040
now explicitly tend to filter and block

2547
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,600
out udp traffic to prevent fire guard

2548
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,639
sessions from being a vector to filtrate

2549
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:30,000
information

2550
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,600
so it could be it could be just as

2551
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,760
simple as them deciding that hey this is

2552
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,239
just a vpn channel and just kick the

2553
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,480
whole lot of udp traffic out

2554
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:42,519

many other areas where it can be

2568
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,199
there are many areas of of improvement

2569
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:32,320

i think it it

2581
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,080
speaks to the importance of

2582
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:03,040
this is a personal perspective obviously

2583
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,480
bottom-up

2584
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:07,119
ixp development

2585
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:10,320

2593
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,840

2595
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:38,360
have a comment before we close

2596
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:42,639
and remember we do have the mailing list

2597
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:44,239
yeah so i was wondering if you have the

2598
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:46,560
time uh under any other business at the

2599
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:49,760
end um i thought i would like to bring

2600
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:52,400
up a small introduction to the n50

2601
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:55,040
project because that's very closely

2602
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:56,800
aligned with

2603
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,960
the goals of this working group and it's

2604
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:00,560
a project that i'm actively involved

2605
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,159
with

2606
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:03,920
promoting digital connectivity and

2607
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,119
literacy

2608
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:07,679
for the remaining 50 percent of the

2609
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,119
world's population that is either

2610
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:13,679
under served or

2611
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:14,639
under

2612
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:18,080
uh you know literate in terms of uh

2613
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:20,080
being connected with the global commons

2614
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,800
via the internet

2615
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,320
we uh

2616
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,000
we may not have enough time for you

2617
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,719
rajiv so i wonder if it's possible

2618
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:30,480
do you have a presentation you could pop

2619
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:33,360
into the gaia chat and we could try and

2620
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:36,560
hold um another online gaia in between

2621
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,920
this uh

2622
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,840
i don't have a

2623
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,800
i don't have a presentation ready so uh

2624
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,080
if you believe that this is something

2625
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,960
that might make sense to maybe push

2626
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,199
forward to one one fourth uh you know

2627
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:50,400
i'm happy to

2628
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,760
plan that out because uh we're actually

2629
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,880
shortly in uh the process of going live

2630
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:00,400
at a pilot site in uh sub-saharan africa

2631
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,880
in zambia so we should actually have

2632
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,320
some real community engagement

2633
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,880
statistics to present uh by the next

2634
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,000
meeting if you believe that's

2635
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,119
appropriate

2636
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:11,679
absolutely um it would be great so could

2637
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:16,639
we um kindly ask you to help us so that

2638
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,760

2639
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:28,639

2640
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,360

interested please do go have a look at

2643
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:38,239
it it is a pretty large initiative uh i

2644
01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:40,480
think spearheaded mostly by intel they

2645
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:41,760
are the ones who are kind of driving

2646
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:44,320
this at the moment up through though

2647
