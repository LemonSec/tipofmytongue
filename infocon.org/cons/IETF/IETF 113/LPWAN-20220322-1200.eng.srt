1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,279
if you try if you want if you know how

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,360
to use it you know there's a new tool in

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,480
mythical pascal that we can

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,880
log here and then from the mobile phone

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,199
we the presenter can can ask for

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,119
permission to control

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,680
yes yes i mean you do that yes

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,279
if you want to do it that way i will

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,880
just i will just pass you the ownership

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,359
or you will load the slide yourself uh

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,400
no i'll

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,560
i'll try with logging from my phone and

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,079
then i'll i'll send the request when i

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,640
present and you should see a request yes

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,280
exactly i should see i should see the

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,360
you asking to present a slide where that

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,399
you selected okay we we start

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,719
um so this is um the uh ietf lp1

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,600
workgroup meeting we have just one hour

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,719
so it's very very short time so we will

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
try to move on quickly

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,120
so remember that this session is being

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,280
recorded with the mythical tool

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,559
so the it's a bit

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,880
unusual as a meeting so

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,799
first first um

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,960
the the usual itf best practices still

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,159
apply whether you're you're at home or

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,439
you're in the room

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,640
and uh

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
more specifically uh we attract your

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,520
attention to the uh bcp 25

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,400
about anti-wristband procedure so if you

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,799
feel that there is some a response going

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,479
on then you need to contact the

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,840
onboard's team and there is a link on

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,040
this page

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,200
and then obviously as usual if you're

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,880
aware of any ipr

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
on a subject which is being discussed

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,479
today whether it's your ipr or somebody

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,840
else apr please mention it or during the

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
meeting or after the meeting

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,560
and as i said it is a bit unusual for a

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,200
number of reasons first yes we have this

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,040
mixed environment where we have where we

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,600
have in-person meeting people and remote

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,360
participants

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,759
and then the the other unusual thing is

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,920
we have the youngest participant of our

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,159
working group we have theodore

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,439
so alexander will not be with us but uh

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,758
almost but the heart will be with us and

54
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,319
until though his new son will be uh with

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,160
us as well in the art

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,680
so if you're interested

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
just your mic because we lost you a

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,959
little bit

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,959
oh that's mike i think it's

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,360
nothing okay i can move on towards the

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
mic it's very unusual this mic normally

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
works fine okay if you're in person

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,840
please uh join the mitico

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,879
using the inside tool

65
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,239
and that's basically the lightweight

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,560
mythical and what's important is when

67
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
you want to join the queue you don't

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,920
join the cube by just going to the mic

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
as you did before you need to click on

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,599
the mythico this is really important

71
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,440
because that will let

72
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,560
the not

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,280
taker uh see you your name

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,080
and uh so so it makes things easier and

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
then the chairs can observe the cue

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,480
whether they are inside or not

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,040
if you're on site please keep your audio

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,040
and your video off

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,560
um

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,480
remote participants

81
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,360
uh

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,319
it's as usual so so uh

83
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,360
keep your audio and video off because

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
we could turn you off but it's much

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,360
better that you do it by yourself

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,480
and

87
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,360
preferably use a headset so there is no

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
loop

89
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
with the the sound in the room

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,760
and then again alexander will not be

91
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,959
with us

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,720
but a thought for the new dad and

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,680
welcome theodore

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
so um

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,519
you've been there for almost two days

96
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,280
now so you know

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,879
the usual resources

98
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,159
so the you get the agenda the

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,400
preparation for mitigo but hopefully

100
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
you've done it before

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,239
but if you need any assistance then

102
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,200
you've got

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,680
this url here

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,480
now

105
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,120
for the minutes we have two volunteers

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,519
that's dominique and events so it's here

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,080
they're joined lcc value

108
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,040
uh

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,239
and

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,560
i will try to take some notes as well

111
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,640
for remote participation

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,239
you can also type

113
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,599
on the chat

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,760
on the left of the screen and that's

115
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,839
bridged actually with our zulip

116
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,160
experiment so you will find people on

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
jabber you will find people

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,759
on the chat on the viticulture and

119
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
people in zulip all of them

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
connect interconnected together

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
unbridged

122
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,479
so agenda from the agenda that we

123
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,840
published there is a little change

124
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,479
alexander is not with us so we will skip

125
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,759
his session

126
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,240
and in the end we give more time to to

127
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
the the discussion on the mesh that you

128
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,240
will find on the next page

129
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,040
so this quick administrative year

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
discussion by juan carlos right now on

131
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,080
the compound act document which is ready

132
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
for publication

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,639
then lauren will talk about the yang

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,120
data data model

135
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,600
then we welcome digo

136
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,560
to speak about the chicagfox

137
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,039
and now

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,840
and then that's where the most the more

139
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,800
discussion piece of this meeting starts

140
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
it will be uh pretty much 1 35

141
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,479
we will have carlos talking about uh

142
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,520
check on 82.54

143
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,400
and and after the interest where we we

144
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,800
started discussing the issue basically

145
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,120
be more specific on the role of

146
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,919
device and app what that becomes when

147
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,560
you have a mesh peer-to-peer

148
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,479
and based on that

149
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,919
lauren will will

150
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,960
give us

151
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,000
information about a new draft which is

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,080
which will be or has been just now

153
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,840
published where effectively uh

154
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
it's chic is employed of our mesh and

155
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,080
how to structure the rules in that kind

156
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
of case

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,280
status of the working group

158
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,319
um

159
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,560
well not much change we are very close

160
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,639
to publishing to sending for publication

161
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,039
the the

162
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,840
compound and document and the iot is not

163
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
far behind

164
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,400
uh

165
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
young data model is

166
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
mostly there as well

167
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,280
so we are very close to completing most

168
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,159
of our items

169
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,319
and that's pretty much it in the

170
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,560
interest of time i will skip directly to

171
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
you

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
um do you want to try to propose slides

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
one colors to see if you can join this

174
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,319
temple on your phone

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
hi uh

176
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
actually if you can share them then i

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
can request to control them on my phone

178
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,840
oh okay i can shine push control to you

179
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
i mean no worries

180
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,160
so let me let me do that

181
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,319
so

182
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,240
let's see

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,960
okay so now i'm

184
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,080
requesting i guess control

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
i don't see your request let me just

186
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
give it to you it's quite easier

187
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,000
so you should have it now

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,240
okay

189
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,039
yeah

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,319
oh works perfect

191
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,880
so hi everyone juan carlos suniga uh

192
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
village cisco and this is an update on

193
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,160
the

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,800
lp one chic compound ack

195
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,759
document that as you heard is now on

196
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,479
the shipper's review

197
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,280
so

198
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,720
um

199
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,039
i'm going to get right away into the

200
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,720
the

201
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
comments that we got

202
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,560
from

203
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,639
yes

204
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,560
we have an issue on the remote is we are

205
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
not seeing you actually we are seeing

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
eric and lauren

207
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,560
but we are not seeing you

208
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,960
okay there's the other camera

209
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,520
but

210
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,879
yeah

211
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,360
that's good yes that works okay please

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
continue sorry for that

213
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,360
otherwise you can you can type mythical

214
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,199
on the on the chat and then ask them to

215
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,479
switch the

216
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,759
the camera

217
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,039
if you want

218
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
because there's two cameras one pointing

219
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
to the public and then one pointing to

220
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,800
the to me

221
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
so the one that's pointing to you is

222
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
actually was actually pointing to too

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
long so you returned it it's almost good

224
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,360
we could turn it a little bit more we

225
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,720
see you you're

226
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,160
just on the left

227
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,080
let's see if you go nearer

228
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,919
no no that's the wrong direction towards

229
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
the lord

230
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,679
i don't think you can move but you can

231
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,240
yes it's good that that works yes that's

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,760
much better thank you sorry for the

233
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,480
impact no no worries thanks thanks

234
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,279
so

235
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,600
um

236
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
so we we got a few a few comments uh

237
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,600
from pascal on the on the sherpas review

238
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,839
so the first ones are easy uh the

239
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,160
document uh is now clearly indicating

240
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,160
that it updates rfc 8724 and the tag

241
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,360
then uh also we added text to to the

242
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
abstract and introduction about the

243
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
clarifying that the document applies

244
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,360
only to the connector part of rx rfc

245
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,360
8724

246
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,360
the first

247
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,920
long one that it was a little

248
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
unclear is the text we had some text

249
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,839
about the placement of window number

250
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,800
zero

251
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,399
and of course for us as implementers it

252
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,680
was easy but

253
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,839
now we understood that it wasn't very

254
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,240
clear the the text itself

255
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,640
it was referring to to one of the of the

256
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,200
requirements on the on the

257
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
document is

258
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,680
the order of the windows have to be uh

259
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
specifically from the lowest to the

260
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
highest and therefore if ever you

261
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
include one window number zero there's a

262
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,240
specific place where this identifier has

263
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,279
to go

264
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,240
so

265
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,399
then i think we cleared it up we have we

266
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,880
added a new paragraph specifying exactly

267
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,040
what we meant by that

268
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
and and this is not only to comply with

269
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,079
the

270
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,440
requirement about the order of the

271
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,519
windows but also it helps uh

272
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
differentiating with padding bits if

273
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
ever these are

274
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,640
uh included

275
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
then

276
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
there was a comment about uh a sentence

277
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,600
that was uh

278
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
not clear to understand and looked like

279
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,519
it was copied in full and indeed it was

280
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,079
a copy-paste error so

281
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,720
we omitted the the old text and we have

282
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,959
just the new text twice and therefore

283
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,720
there was no no difference in between

284
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,240
the old and the new

285
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
now they all is actually the the one

286
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,920
from

287
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,959
87 24 so it's clear that uh what what is

288
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,599
the updates

289
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
no for some reason we lost the big

290
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
screen i see it in the in the little

291
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,399
laptop but uh

292
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,560
okay so maybe can you under the queue so

293
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,040
you can make a sign to juan carlos yeah

294
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,079
yes okay

295
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,560
so so so let me let me just go through

296
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,000
this slide and then we'll take the

297
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,440
question from dominique

298
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
the last the last point is the the

299
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
flagging the new behavior for the all

300
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,160
zero usage

301
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,440
since uh

302
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,120
uh the the receiver already had

303
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,440
um basically when you send the icon

304
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
error the receiver could

305
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
we we know that we could lose a message

306
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
but that we added a new behavior on the

307
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,079
on the sender about the choice to send

308
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,360
or not the the chic ack depending on

309
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,240
let's say network conditions

310
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,560
so i think uh we can take the question

311
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
from dominique before going to the next

312
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,560
slide

313
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,680
hi

314
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,839
yep well yeah actually i was going to

315
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,240
ask if you wanted uh questions in

316
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
in the middle of the presentation or at

317
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,959
the end

318
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,560
up to you

319
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,120
um i think uh we we only have one more

320
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,639
slide then it is

321
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,079
about next step so we can take the

322
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,120
question now

323
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,160
okay

324
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,440
yeah i i

325
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,279
just wanted to mention that i just read

326
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,360
the new version the list

327
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
and yeah sorry it took me a while to

328
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,360
to work on this for several reasons but

329
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,200
uh i still have a few comments on the

330
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,079
text

331
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,120
um

332
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,680
like there are a few typos you take so

333
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,040
if you allow me

334
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,720
if you tell me where the source was

335
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,399
located i can

336
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,320
submit for requests to the text and then

337
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,680
we can also

338
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,760
discuss

339
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,519
the more material issues um

340
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,519
on the mailing list maybe

341
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,959
like the new paragraph you inserted uh

342
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,399
on the position of the w uh

343
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,360
zero uh windows zero has a few mistakes

344
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,320
in it i think it says

345
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,279
the first uh

346
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,639
the paddock bits

347
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,720
are not confused with

348
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,959
the window number after the first hack

349
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,360
something where it should be the last

350
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
and few things like that

351
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,680
but you know nothing serious

352
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,240
but i think the the text needs a little

353
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
bit of polishing still so if i can

354
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,040
contribute i'll be more than happy

355
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,440
yes please please please do uh it's true

356
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,519
that uh there's a couple of paragraphs

357
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,560
that were added to to respond to this uh

358
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,399
comments but those paragraphs are are

359
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,320
indeed new so if they're if there are

360
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,920
corrections or

361
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,959
uh

362
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,720
anything we can do to enhance the the

363
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,959
text please please send us the comments

364
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,320
uh dominic on the list it will be the

365
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
best

366
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,760
okay another comment i had just

367
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,959
mentioned

368
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,199
in my first review was about uh

369
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,720
distinguishing the

370
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,680
the new compound back with the

371
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,920
abort message and

372
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,399
and so you provided a few lines

373
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,160
that tell that somebody else they hit

374
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,880
the profiles must tell

375
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,279
houses they are uh distinguished

376
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,839
uh and so it's kind of pushing the

377
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,600
resolution of the problem to somebody

378
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,120
else so i left when i read your text

379
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,480
to that the

380
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,480
lp1 rfc i'm sorry the lore one

381
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,880
document is already published so

382
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
if you're telling now

383
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
that the application document to a

384
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,199
specific technology must specify

385
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,399
something

386
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,519
then it

387
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,920
now means that the one guys cannot use

388
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,399
this new extension

389
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,199
or maybe have to write another rfc or

390
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,240
something

391
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,360
so

392
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,120
i think we could solve that issue in

393
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
this document rather than

394
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,680
pushing it to somebody else

395
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,319
what do you think

396
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,079
um

397
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,000
i think we can add

398
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,279
i'm just thinking what would be the

399
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,800
procedure because it's true that this

400
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,399
document somehow

401
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,120
uh updates the the baseline that already

402
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,040
was used by laura want to produce their

403
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,480
profile

404
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,720
so it's true i think it'll be too too

405
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,440
heavy to do an update to the lora one

406
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,040
for this but we could add an annex

407
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,920
perhaps you know to for technology

408
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,519
specific

409
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,320
uh details uh that that's my my first

410
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,959
hand thinking but of course it'll be up

411
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,480
to the group and

412
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,279
and

413
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,959
mainly i guess that the lower one guys

414
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,600
but what would be the best

415
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
okay now we see the line but yeah i

416
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,279
think it's a fair discussion to have on

417
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,560
the

418
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,880
on the list

419
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,839
okay

420
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,040
um yeah so i i need still uh

421
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,199
some thinking but i think we can we can

422
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,639
do

423
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,440
something easier on on the existing uh

424
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,800
technology application drafts

425
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,800
okay

426
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,279
yeah give me a few hours of your work

427
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,399
and maybe a few days of uh

428
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,880
clock time and i can

429
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,800
propose some things

430
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,360
all right so so then i guess that uh

431
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,759
the last slide i had is on the if we had

432
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,920
a res all the all the comments but seems

433
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,120
like there is going to be a couple

434
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,839
arriving that that are relevant

435
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,920
and my understanding is we we are going

436
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,480
to have the shepherds uh transferred

437
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,920
also to alex who's not right now here so

438
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,600
probably the best would be to to take it

439
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,720
to the list

440
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,560
and then uh

441
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,279
don't we don't push the button right now

442
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,440
so we wait until uh until we clear these

443
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,880
comments uh

444
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,440
from you and and we hear from from alex

445
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,240
uh

446
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,320
on his uh shepherd's review to push the

447
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,240
button

448
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
yes it might be not to discuss but if i

449
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,600
like

450
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
because of the performer

451
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,320
we might again switch uh shepherd

452
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,240
and maybe now

453
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
but laura is got also probably uh as can

454
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,199
i she she's willing to to do the shape

455
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,480
okay

456
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,839
so we we are exploring that

457
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,199
because might be away for a few weeks

458
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,839
and if you get ready early that waiting

459
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,839
for us returns

460
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,000
okay

461
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,480
all right so thank you very much i think

462
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,160
i'm over my time so

463
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,920
oh and by the way i like your idea of

464
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,119
doing nx for the already documents

465
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,720
published documents

466
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,959
so uh in this case if you if you take

467
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,720
that approach please

468
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,439
mention that you update the lorawan rfc

469
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,359
as well right because you will be

470
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,559
proposing

471
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,079
how the raw one rfc applies this draft

472
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,639
okay thanks

473
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,320
so the next level is is you actually

474
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,000
presenting the young guy

475
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
so i will be pushing the slides and you

476
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
will be doing the next slide right

477
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,720
okay yeah

478
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,760
okay so i will present the

479
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,720
the young model for the she crews so

480
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,960
it's a work that has been done for

481
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,280
many many years and now i think we

482
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,080
reach

483
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,960
something very very nice and we next

484
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
slide please we

485
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,080
let's go

486
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,799
so

487
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,600
this young model is uh as a new version

488
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,799
now to

489
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,200
to say that it's uh really the

490
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,559
last one

491
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,880
and it's cover only what has been

492
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,880
published until now it's mean rfc 787 24

493
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
and 88 24.

494
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,520
so inside we have the rule definition so

495
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,919
for the three kind of rule we have

496
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,840
compression fragmentation and no

497
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,200
compression

498
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
we have also the identifier that i use

499
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,919
in the sql and as we say component hack

500
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,520
and aom are not in that model but with

501
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,559
young we can easily augment the model

502
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,400
with new features

503
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,880
next slide

504
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,919
so here is a vision a global vision of

505
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,480
the young tree so we see the

506
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,799
different kind of rules so what has

507
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,360
changed since the previous version is

508
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,120
especially the naming

509
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,200
so we have a naming that is closer to

510
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,240
the rfc so it's easier to recognize

511
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
which field is

512
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,960
in correspondence with the rfc and we

513
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,640
also add

514
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,559
something that is called max interleaf

515
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,679
frames that is also specified in

516
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,200
8724

517
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,039
and say how many

518
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,919
frames can be on the air and it can be

519
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,320
something smaller but what

520
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
the d tag allows

521
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,960
so here are all the the changes we have

522
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
we have also made some

523
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,760
relation between the different variable

524
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,559
and we are able to for example for

525
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,400
compression to say this field is only

526
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,160
needed if we are in account error or in

527
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,160
another mod so next two slides please

528
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,360
so you can go to the next one

529
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,799
and now what i will present more is

530
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,880
what we have done at the acaton to to

531
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,159
test this so it's visa carton and the

532
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,240
previous one so the data model has been

533
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,400
implemented in open cheek

534
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,960
and we are able to validate using a

535
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,159
yongsan this model on to produce some

536
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,919
json

537
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,159
version of of the rule

538
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,559
so here is some simple rule we we have

539
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,280
used and in the next slide so

540
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
next slide please we have the json

541
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
representation of these rules

542
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,559
and if we look at the size of the global

543
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,159
rule here it has been cut is about 2 500

544
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,120
bytes to represent the rule so during

545
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,600
this acaton we have changed the

546
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,000
representation and we move to c bar

547
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,159
unused core conf so that's the next

548
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,200
slide

549
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,440
and here the same rule can be

550
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,480
represented in 400 bytes so it's a

551
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,840
reduction by six of the of the size

552
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,080
which is which is quite nice

553
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
of course when you look at this is not

554
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,080
very easy to to understand

555
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,720
but if you go to the next slide

556
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
we have the same thing in the diagnostic

557
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
representation of sibor

558
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,919
and various few mistakes but what here

559
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,600
because it was done

560
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
during the academy we have correct them

561
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,480
but what we can see is that we we have

562
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,880
something that is very compact

563
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,200
and if we look for example at what is

564
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,880
the largest part of the

565
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,400
representation or see the qualcomm

566
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,960
representation is the identifier for

567
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,159
example if you read you see six and then

568
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,440
a large number so six mean it's a

569
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,600
field id and then you have the reference

570
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,280
to to the field id so if we can have

571
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,440
very short seed

572
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,559
for these values so of course the rule

573
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,120
will be uh smaller

574
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
so the next things we we discover and

575
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,640
it's a funny thing about about the rule

576
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,799
is that when you do the seed in fact you

577
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,799
have a reference that is the first entry

578
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,360
so for example for rule you have this

579
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,120
big number 91

580
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,520
and then when we look at some value that

581
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,480
are present in all the rules like rule

582
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,960
id length and rule id value

583
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,760
they are at a distance of 23 29 or 30

584
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,440
from the

585
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,799
the reference

586
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,200
which means that in the c bar coding we

587
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
use two bytes

588
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,200
so if we had a

589
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,400
delta that was shorter then we will use

590
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,280
only one byte to to represent that

591
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,640
so of course it's just something

592
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,480
funny right now but maybe we will have

593
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,679
to discuss on a way to optimize that

594
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,799
or i think that maybe one solution

595
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,400
will be to

596
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,200
when we will do the numbering of sids to

597
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,039
change the order and i think it's

598
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
possible in uh

599
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
in cocoa because we just have to

600
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,760
augment the model once uh starts with a

601
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
small value and then

602
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,240
uh small model and then increase it by

603
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,720
introducing new things we can have rule

604
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,400
id and rule id length that will be more

605
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,640
compact in their presentation

606
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,440
so

607
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,000
what we have to do now is to check with

608
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,360
korkov guys

609
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,520
if it's correct so i know that there is

610
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
some people in the room or

611
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,000
virtually in the room that know very

612
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,720
well come so we can discuss

613
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,240
about that but i think it's quite

614
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,880
interesting because we goes to something

615
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,760
that is very compact and can be used to

616
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
manage

617
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,000
the rune the rule in a constraint

618
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,320
environment

619
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,158
okay so if you have questions

620
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,279
so

621
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,000
that's all for for me

622
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,559
okay thank you very much lauren and um

623
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,760
i will bring the next uh presentation

624
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
with uh

625
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,240
diego from chicago

626
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,230
can you hear me

627
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,480
[Music]

628
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,720
yes

629
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,880
can you control these knights i just

630
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,000
sent you the other ship

631
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,600
everyone just tell me to move this light

632
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,440
myself

633
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,960
um

634
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,360
[Music]

635
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,799
i am trying to take control of the

636
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,440
slides right now

637
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
i sent you the control

638
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,159
oh

639
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,799
you're sharing your own deck okay

640
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,840
shake over

641
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
yeah that works okay you should be

642
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,840
seeing that and i can control them all

643
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,880
right

644
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
yes that's all good

645
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,760
so hello my name is diego vistuba and

646
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,520
i'm from nick labs in the university of

647
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
chile and i am one of the co-authors of

648
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,400
the

649
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,880
shakeover siegfox uh

650
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,440
the ship profile of sigfox

651
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
and i'm here to

652
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,279
i'm here to present the last draft

653
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,440
updates that we have done since the last

654
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,679
uh iitf meetings so

655
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
we had we added two major uh changes to

656
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,919
this uh draft the first one is that we

657
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,679
we added two different configurations

658
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,640
for the

659
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,120
uplink icon mode on the two byte check

660
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,159
header

661
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,240
uh these two configurations are

662
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,080
parameter configurations you know that

663
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,000
all the all the values that we need to

664
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,159
define for chic to work

665
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,279
and

666
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,679
well option one in this case we labeled

667
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,640
only option one uh allows transmission

668
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,120
of medium-sized packets which are up to

669
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,960
480 bytes long

670
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,760
and the second option allows

671
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,640
transmission for larger packets up to

672
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,559
2250 bytes long and this is more than

673
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,600
enough for us to comply with the ipv6

674
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,799
mto requirements which is

675
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,559
1280 if i'm not mistaken uh bytes

676
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,480
so that is one of the two major

677
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,960
additions and the other one is the rcs

678
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,679
field the reassembly check sequence

679
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,919
field

680
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,760
in our case for our use cases of the

681
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,000
in the sigfox network

682
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,240
for rules where the number of fragments

683
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,400
in the last window is unknown but we

684
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,320
don't know how how many fragments does

685
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
the lab window contain

686
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,480
this rcs field must be used must be

687
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,039
present in the at the end of the of the

688
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,520
header and it should indicate the number

689
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,840
of fragments in that window this number

690
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,360
of fragments is of course encoded in

691
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,559
bits and it includes the the old one

692
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,200
uh well previously we didn't use then we

693
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,679
didn't use the rcs field in the ship

694
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,640
profile since uh safe fox had it has it

695
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
only ever connected mechanism and we

696
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,200
used that for

697
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,440
uh in to check the integrity of the

698
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,799
whole reassembly

699
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,600
but

700
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
this uh this new addition of the rcs

701
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,520
field

702
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,159
makes us avoid ambiguous ambiguity while

703
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,080
checking the completion of the of the

704
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,960
whole

705
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,080
uh chic transmission

706
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,200
and uh okay so the next steps for the

707
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,399
for the draft

708
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,799
we need to of course update the the

709
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,320
figures describing these new

710
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
configurations how they how they look

711
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,360
like the ordering of the of all the

712
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,520
all the all the parameters and how these

713
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,559
fragments would look like while in the

714
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,440
in graphic representations and we also

715
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,000
uh need to update the shakeover sigfox

716
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,399
implementation we have our own

717
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,480
implementation to this to test all these

718
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,080
changes and we need to

719
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,159
we need to

720
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,640
to know how these changes uh affect the

721
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,799
the the performance of the of the whole

722
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,440
protocol so this particular step this

723
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,240
updating of the cfox implementation has

724
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,720
been underway since the hackathon on

725
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,000
saturday

726
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,799
and we still need to solve more

727
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,440
um more issues on that but it's

728
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,840
underway

729
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,240
and that's it for my presentation thank

730
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
you so much for it for your attention if

731
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,880
you have any questions please

732
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,480
make them i would be happy to ask

733
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,880
i mean the only question is how close do

734
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,919
you think you are to one group

735
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,919
do you think you will what what will

736
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,919
happen before now and we ask for work

737
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,399
with let's go

738
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,440
sorry i can't i don't hear you very

739
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,480
oh

740
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,120
so my question is uh

741
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,200
what what steps do you think we need

742
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,840
before we go

743
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,480
sorry juan carlos

744
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,880
here on the q it's uh pascal

745
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,320
i know that when we're in the mic

746
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,080
because the speakers point to the back

747
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,559
it's really hard to to to understand so

748
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,720
let me repeat your question uh he's

749
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,240
asking uh what is needed before we go to

750
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,559
last call so what is needed before

751
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,640
completing the the document okay i think

752
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,159
that before

753
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,960
asking for the last call of this um of

754
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,559
this chic profile

755
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,360
we need to first make sure that we don't

756
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,200
have any corner cases left before

757
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,480
because that's why um like uh

758
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,640
the last updates of this of this check

759
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,880
profile have been taking care of corner

760
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,960
cases that we find when we are trying

761
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,840
the

762
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,559
the

763
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,200
the shakeover sig fox implementation

764
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,279
so uh we have some

765
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,679
we have some tests that we need to do

766
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,320
and to make sure that the oh well the

767
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,039
new additions doesn't uh doesn't break

768
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,880
the the whole protocol

769
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,840
and if we are okay with that and if we

770
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,640
have

771
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,600
if we have clarified all that um

772
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,360
all that updates in the in the draft

773
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,039
then i think that we

774
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,320
that will be the

775
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,600
uh

776
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,720
the final updates to the to make this uh

777
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,039
another seal to to make to take this

778
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,399
tour to alaska

779
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,240
thank you very much

780
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,480
thank you so much for your attention

781
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,000
welcome in the group and presenting

782
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,120
um

783
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,159
so next is shakeover and biuti

784
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,960
and that would be anna presenting

785
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,600
um and now you want me to to launch your

786
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,039
slides or do you want to launch them

787
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,080
yourself

788
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,840
now please do it for me

789
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,660
okay i'm on it

790
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,819
[Music]

791
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,640
just head over to you

792
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,559
yeah thank you pascal

793
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,520
so

794
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,720
i'm presenting the version seven of the

795
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,760
draft

796
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,919
check over and the iot

797
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,120
um

798
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,080
next slide please

799
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,399
come forward

800
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,399
i cannot hear you very well

801
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,519
oh

802
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,279
okay

803
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,600
i gave you control now

804
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,320
you should be able to move the slidesy

805
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,950
yes

806
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,430
[Music]

807
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,570
[Laughter]

808
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,679
okay

809
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,760
this is better than calligraphy

810
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,200
um

811
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
thank you to carlos i don't know how my

812
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,679
slides are like this but

813
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,760
we received

814
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,840
the review from carlos thank you very

815
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,158
much

816
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,320
there are

817
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,919
four principal questions the first one

818
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,720
is more structural of the of the

819
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,080
document

820
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,519
to better

821
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,120
represent

822
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,600
what is configuration that what is this

823
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,799
case

824
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,120
so we need to work the structure of the

825
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,799
document

826
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,240
in the first

827
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,039
time then the second

828
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,480
question is

829
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,760
about the first useless case

830
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,720
where we are using

831
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,760
chic

832
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,000
in the radio link

833
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,960
between the device and the

834
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,440
and the gateway than not b

835
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,039
so this is really the the radio link

836
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,679
and in nb iot as in any 3gpp network

837
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,760
this link has a protocol stack

838
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,000
which

839
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,840
already introduced

840
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,760
a integrity protection

841
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,360
reordering

842
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,440
segmentation

843
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,539
[Music]

844
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,200
on the

845
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,519
data transfer so the only thing missing

846
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,480
is

847
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,840
to put as they have already done

848
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,799
rock to put chick in the pdcp layer

849
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,720
and and send

850
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,480
the ip packet compressed

851
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,519
in this

852
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,559
in this case the question from

853
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,880
carlos was why we are not using

854
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,039
fragmentation in this case

855
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,519
is because the lower layers

856
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,360
of the radial link

857
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,279
already bring this feature so we don't

858
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,559
really need

859
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,200
that pdcp layer makes

860
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
a fragmentation because its segmentation

861
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,480
is done in rlc

862
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,600
so

863
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,799
so we are only taking the use of feather

864
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,200
compression for this use case

865
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,050
i don't know if it's clear

866
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,200
[Music]

867
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,640
i have not found any any use where we

868
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,760
can say

869
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,359
even though rlc has already segmentation

870
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,000
we can add the use of fragmentation in

871
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,520
the pdc player

872
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,879
so if

873
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,520
you have an input layer

874
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,839
in this use case we can discuss

875
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,600
if not i go to my next slide

876
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,119
[Music]

877
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,440
the second question that is really

878
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,760
important is about the draft status

879
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,960
we we put this draft as an informational

880
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,399
draft

881
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,079
because it's only giving guidance of how

882
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,760
we can use cheek

883
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,918
in the 3gbp networks as nbiot

884
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,918
we proposed some parameter values

885
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,879
following the rfc8724

886
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,880
and 8824

887
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,359
we are not changing any feature or

888
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,599
giving new features

889
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,720
and

890
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,920
the other thing i look for the

891
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,480
other 3gpp

892
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,280
documents at the etf

893
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,480
and

894
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
most of them

895
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,160
for all

896
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,200
even though all of them are

897
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,160
informational

898
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,920
so

899
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,680
the question is

900
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,400
do

901
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,920
we need to make a proposed standard for

902
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,240
this cheek over on the iot

903
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,040
or we keep the use of informational as

904
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,480
all the 3gpp documents at the ietf

905
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,440
and

906
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,800
my first

907
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,560
answer would be

908
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,760
why not to put it as a bcp

909
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,680
as a best practice

910
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,560
something that we normally use and we

911
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,440
can

912
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,400
use in this way

913
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,960
so it's very question for

914
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,960
yeah

915
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,720
so pascal we don't hear you at all but i

916
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,240
will simply assume that you were giving

917
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,520
me access to the to the mic

918
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,960
if we specify a protocol in the same way

919
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,359
we specify a protocol over

920
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,320
one or six fox it should aim as an

921
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,000
incense

922
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,240
cities as standards

923
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,320
bcp is really not

924
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,720
the right thing to use and information

925
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,400
and i think it's also the wrong things

926
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,280
to do

927
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,599
it's not because all three gpp are

928
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,839
informational most probably simply

929
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,040
because

930
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,839
they are pushing we are rewriting under

931
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,480
an itf rfc something which has been

932
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,119
specified by 3gpp

933
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,880
and we want to get them in the

934
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,040
the public or whatever under the atf

935
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,760
just typically when we import standards

936
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,920
out of another ldo they become

937
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,160
informational here through the eyes

938
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,560
model or it is sponsored but in this

939
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,359
case

940
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,280
it's like lower one

941
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,359
sick fox so at 99.99 it should be

942
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,359
standards

943
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,960
okay thank you anna

944
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,440
okay thank you

945
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,400
so that answer my question so the thing

946
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,520
is we change the draft status to

947
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,079
the standard okay

948
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,880
and

949
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,960
the third the third important point

950
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,480
is that

951
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,359
3gpp use

952
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,680
ipv6 and ipv4

953
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,720
so the question is does

954
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,040
we are going to develop

955
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,119
the solution for ipv4

956
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,680
or do we skip this part

957
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,520
do you really know

958
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,200
so eric link again so it's more a

959
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,720
question for the chair

960
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
uh to be honest but i'm pretty sure

961
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,480
pascal will agree with me

962
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,000
lp1 if not mistaken is charted only for

963
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,520
ipv6

964
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,280
so the question is clear here the answer

965
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,680
is clear

966
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,440
so if they are using for ipv4 is they

967
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,000
have to develop their own solution

968
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,440
yes

969
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,359
okay

970
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,960
um

971
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,040
well let's keep that um

972
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,800
thank you very much

973
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,280
for your answers um

974
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,000
and then after this modification we

975
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,920
would like to see if it's possible to go

976
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,119
to last call

977
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,319
for this document

978
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,960
okay i i

979
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:12,720
because

980
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,200
we cannot

981
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,560
okay air is good

982
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,160
just talk

983
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,359
okay

984
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,800
so

985
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,320
um okay so so uh yeah i mean we we are

986
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,240
ready to to launch the work group let's

987
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,040
go

988
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,560
for this document

989
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,040
if you feel the the

990
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,960
the current release is good we can

991
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,040
launch it right after the meeting

992
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,000
there's no objection to that

993
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,359
okay

994
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,079
okay so to do for the chair

995
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,079
launch the worker

996
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,599
let's go

997
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,880
for the nba it's document

998
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,440
thank you so sorry for the mic i mean

999
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,280
i'm using that mic all the time and i

1000
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,880
never have a private i have conferences

1001
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,720
all days i don't know what happens

1002
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,800
okay i can't find the volume button for

1003
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,599
in the settings so

1004
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,480
okay uh so our next presentation will be

1005
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,000
uh carles

1006
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,119
for shakeover 802.15.4

1007
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,720
and mostly the device and raw uh and up

1008
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,240
rows

1009
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,240
so

1010
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,480
i will just share for you and then give

1011
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,440
you the ball colors

1012
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
yes it's

1013
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,839
the rendering is very bizarre i

1014
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,960
okay i i checked my own slides they

1015
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,440
realized they were kind of broken

1016
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
and so i

1017
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,920
i uploaded my own pdfs for every group

1018
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,319
i'm presenting to it seems there is

1019
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,640
really something wrong

1020
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
okay but i think we

1021
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,880
if it's for good for you carlos to start

1022
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,680
with that and do not lose too much time

1023
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,319
and have discussion about that

1024
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,200
yeah

1025
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,160
we can

1026
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,000
okay that's good

1027
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,319
yeah i hope we can make it as it is

1028
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,200
um

1029
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,000
okay so my name is carlos gomez and i'm

1030
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,480
going to give a presentation on the

1031
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,359
problem of using the depth and up roles

1032
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,079
for

1033
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,920
using chic header compression over

1034
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,960
802.15.4 networks this problem arises in

1035
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,359
actually when trying to write a draft

1036
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,920
which is the one on the slide which is

1037
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,440
precisely about using chic header

1038
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,440
compression in 15.4 networks

1039
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,040
so um

1040
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,119
the terms that an app

1041
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,640
have been defined for the first time in

1042
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,920
sorry i'm not

1043
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,400
seeing them

1044
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,359
okay i think pascal is sharing and yeah

1045
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,240
so go continue

1046
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,240
so i see that the screen share is being

1047
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,599
started

1048
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,440
uh yeah

1049
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,920
i'm on it i'm on it

1050
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,319
where is it

1051
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,040
oh

1052
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,560
right

1053
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,119
it's quite

1054
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,200
i think it's blocked

1055
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,160
can you go back pascal to oh okay we

1056
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,319
have it now

1057
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,400
yeah sorry i i could not locate this

1058
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,480
application so i had to do screen share

1059
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,839
and since i'm using three screen at the

1060
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,240
same time i scroll my screens sorry

1061
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,839
sorry sorry so you should be back

1062
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,000
okay so this is it

1063
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
i'm seeing the shake of the sick force

1064
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,599
oops slides oh okay

1065
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,280
wrong for me

1066
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,720
uh

1067
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,960
i i don't know if i effectively got them

1068
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,680
because if you uploaded them directly

1069
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
yes

1070
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,839
no actually i don't have your slides i

1071
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,599
need to go and fetch them for the site i

1072
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,319
mean

1073
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,680
sorry for that

1074
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,640
because they did not download a copy

1075
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,720
can you share

1076
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,400
your lesson do you have your slide on

1077
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,119
your desktop

1078
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,839
yes i have the

1079
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,359
yeah so shall i

1080
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,920
share them from my

1081
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,000
theater yeah

1082
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,640
okay so

1083
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,040
yes

1084
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,960
i it to you yeah

1085
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,920
that's just okay so can you see now the

1086
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,280
slides

1087
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,960
perfect perfect

1088
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,440
okay so then i'm going to give this

1089
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,280
presentation about the developers in

1090
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,599
15.4 networks

1091
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,560
and

1092
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,880
the developed terms were defined first

1093
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,839
in the lp1 overview

1094
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:42,480
rfc8376

1095
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,040
which defines the terms that an app

1096
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,240
the dev is the sensor actuator device or

1097
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,839
object which corresponds to the

1098
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,000
constrained device whereas app

1099
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,680
corresponds to application or

1100
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,680
application server which is sort of

1101
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,839
network site infrastructure

1102
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,800
and then the base chic specification rca

1103
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,040
724 uses also these terms and then also

1104
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,119
provides few more details about app such

1105
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,640
as it runs an application sending

1106
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,720
receiving packets to from the dev or

1107
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,000
it's the end point of the application

1108
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,240
level protocol on the internet side

1109
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,119
so also in the base chic specification

1110
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,599
there's the figure showing the lp1

1111
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,319
architecture where we have on the left

1112
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,560
the constrained devices which would

1113
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,359
correspond to the role of dev and then

1114
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,040
on the right we have the application

1115
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,400
server which corresponds to apps

1116
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,480
also related with these terms

1117
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,400
there are two other terms defined in

1118
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,160
eight seven two four which are applying

1119
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,640
and downlink which are based on the

1120
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,720
depth and up turns because applying

1121
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,040
means the direction from the depth to

1122
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,200
and down link is the other direction

1123
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,880
so uh

1124
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,319
in lp1

1125
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,400
of course the devon approach fit well

1126
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,560
the scenario because

1127
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,240
these terms have been extracted actually

1128
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,640
from the lp1 architecture so in that

1129
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,800
case the chic entity that needs to

1130
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,880
perform compression or decompression

1131
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,040
knows whether it corresponds to their

1132
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,079
app

1133
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,640
in rfc 724

1134
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,200
compression rules for some of the ipv6

1135
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,440
and gdp header fields such as the prefix

1136
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,319
the id or the port are expressed in

1137
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,319
terms of that and up

1138
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,720
and not by the position of these fields

1139
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,400
in the headers such as source or

1140
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,839
destination

1141
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,119
so this is done uh as an optimization it

1142
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,880
has the advantage that the same rule can

1143
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,480
then be used for compression

1144
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,280
decompression for both directions

1145
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,000
so

1146
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,079
then it means that for example when that

1147
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,560
has to compress

1148
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,359
it knows that the source address or port

1149
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,200
in the packet header

1150
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,800
uh corresponds to depth as written as

1151
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,599
the address report in the rules so this

1152
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,920
is when the the compressor

1153
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,880
looks

1154
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,760
for the rule which is the the best match

1155
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,760
and then in the other direction when

1156
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,800
that has to decompress then it knows

1157
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
that uh what will be the source

1158
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,880
addressor port is what corresponds to

1159
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,280
what is expressed as up in the address

1160
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,400
port written in a rule

1161
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,640
so what about now trying to use the same

1162
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,960
roles for chic header compression over

1163
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,800
15.4 networks

1164
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,960
well there's a subset of them such as

1165
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,200
star topology networks where the

1166
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,520
constrained devices may talk to some

1167
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,319
network site app in that case the the

1168
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,480
dev and app model fits well

1169
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,640
uh as in lp1 because it's actually the

1170
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,559
same underlying architecture

1171
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,400
however then there can be

1172
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,559
peer-to-peer topologies for example

1173
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,680
where

1174
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,359
in some scenarios we might have two

1175
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,960
constrained devices talking to each

1176
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,839
other

1177
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,760
so in that case we may have the question

1178
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,680
of well which is the role that

1179
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,920
corresponds to it because according to

1180
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,359
the definition

1181
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,760
both could be candidates to be dead so

1182
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,079
then how do we use chic compression

1183
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,400
decompression in this case

1184
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,079
here are some examples

1185
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,720
we may have node a on the left which is

1186
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,160
a light sensor

1187
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,920
that may transmit a message for example

1188
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,240
when the light intensity is too low uh

1189
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,920
to the other node on the right which is

1190
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,920
not b it is a light bulb

1191
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,640
and in this case we might say okay

1192
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,680
let's try to assign deven up roles to

1193
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,119
these devices

1194
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,280
so for example we could say node a is

1195
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,599
dep node b is up

1196
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,160
and we could write the rules accordingly

1197
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,680
beforehand

1198
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,640
and then

1199
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,839
we might also consider that scenarios

1200
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,559
may get more complex like adding a node

1201
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,960
c which might maybe want to control the

1202
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
threshold setting of the light intensity

1203
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,520
sensor in that case which other roles

1204
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
that would correspond to each

1205
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,319
perhaps we could start by saying maybe

1206
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,559
light sensor could be up the threshold

1207
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,160
control could be dead

1208
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,400
or maybe we might want to try to

1209
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
simplify things a bit and try to have

1210
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,559
node a being always

1211
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,359
the same role such as depth in all its

1212
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,000
interactions with all its endpoints but

1213
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,680
then another question arises which is

1214
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,599
can we ensure that the device will only

1215
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,680
be there or only be up for all its

1216
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,760
interactions with all its corresponding

1217
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,520
endpoints

1218
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,559
so

1219
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,760
uh then

1220
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,480
here we can figure out that maybe we

1221
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,599
have two main options to consider

1222
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,160
uh when trying to use chicago

1223
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,960
compression in this sort of peer-to-peer

1224
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,640
topologies

1225
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,800
the first option option one is

1226
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,720
trying to stick to what is defined

1227
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,359
already in rfc 8724

1228
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,440
in this case its device would need to

1229
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,839
know whether it is never up when talking

1230
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,079
to another device and this might need to

1231
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:40,960
be

1232
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,319
for any

1233
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,040
possible communication endpoint

1234
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,119
and in that case if we follow this

1235
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,119
approach the upline and downlink terms

1236
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,040
would be specific to each pair of

1237
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,400
endpoints

1238
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,640
so here we might need to provide some

1239
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,359
additional context to the nodes so that

1240
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,280
they know whether they are never up for

1241
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,000
each potential endpoint

1242
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,079
option two would be

1243
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,319
trying to define the use of source and

1244
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,319
destination in the rules

1245
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,119
instead of the wrap

1246
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,839
however this has a drawback which is

1247
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,319
that it requires one rule for each

1248
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,559
direction so this might potentially

1249
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,400
duplicate the number of rules that we

1250
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,720
are considering and also

1251
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,559
new terms such as uplink or downlink

1252
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,559
might need to be

1253
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:27,680
defined

1254
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,559
so

1255
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,960
this has been discussed in a couple of

1256
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,000
lp1 interims and by the way uh tomorrow

1257
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,240
there will be also a presentation on the

1258
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,040
related draft in in six load

1259
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,160
and so far i'd say that there seems to

1260
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,040
be some rough preference for maybe

1261
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,240
option one because here we

1262
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,160
rely on we don't need to modify

1263
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,880
rfc8724

1264
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,040
and however option two has also been

1265
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,319
considered

1266
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,599
so yeah um these are like two main

1267
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,160
approaches we may want to think about so

1268
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,640
what is the feedback from the working

1269
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,920
group

1270
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,000
you've got nowhere in the

1271
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,400
can you see the queue it's slow

1272
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,200
okay uh yeah i'm just seeing my slides

1273
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,000
on the screen on my laptop yeah

1274
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,240
i don't know where to go as if he's here

1275
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,079
so is i stay here

1276
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,040
uh

1277
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,680
yes i think there is another option it's

1278
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,400
i

1279
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,280
i like the first one because you

1280
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,920
uh you keep the same naming but

1281
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,760
what you can do also is to avoid to have

1282
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,680
a bidirectional

1283
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,720
rule

1284
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,559
and you can have a

1285
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,559
for example a device with up or the

1286
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,079
device with down

1287
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,680
and this way you can

1288
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,000
change the nature of your rule

1289
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,240
so now it's symmetric it's mostly

1290
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,599
because of the b

1291
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,839
bi-directional in the direction

1292
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,720
then does it mean you would need to have

1293
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,880
one direction for sorry one rule for one

1294
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,480
direction another rule for the other

1295
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,920
direction

1296
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,000
yes you can have this and it means that

1297
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,880
you can

1298
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,200
handle them in different way

1299
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,439
okay

1300
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,960
okay any other i'm not seeing i'm just

1301
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,559
seeing this light on my screen so i

1302
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,720
don't know if there's any other question

1303
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,160
or any other

1304
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,399
yes

1305
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,520
yeah i'm not sure it's a good idea i'm

1306
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,119
just throwing some

1307
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,280
ideas in here

1308
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,880
the

1309
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,680
up down and by fields

1310
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,640
our qualifiers are perfield

1311
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,119
uh can we use them just for the app and

1312
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,480
the dev

1313
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,599
fields

1314
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,559
and play with them so that

1315
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,880
we tweak the the meaning of up and def

1316
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,319
using those

1317
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:53,680
so it's not the rule that applies to up

1318
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,559
or down it's each field within a rule

1319
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,800
right

1320
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,720
it was kind of a shortcut long when you

1321
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,480
said you can have one rule for up and

1322
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,000
one rule for down

1323
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,480
we can have one same rule

1324
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,200
with the field marked marked up and down

1325
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,079
i'm not sure if this makes sense just

1326
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,040
ignore if it doesn't

1327
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,040
uh eric

1328
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,800
can you share me better now i tweaked my

1329
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,319
mic but i don't know if it's better

1330
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,680
pascal you need to understand what you

1331
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,920
said but anyway so carles thank you for

1332
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,119
this document i just wonder whether you

1333
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,160
should make this document broader than

1334
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,839
the 15.4

1335
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,960
because it's applicable to any network

1336
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,640
where there is not a mastery we cannot

1337
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,720
say master slave my dev app

1338
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,440
right so change the title and change the

1339
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,400
file name maybe next time

1340
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,240
and good job

1341
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,720
okay thank you

1342
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,000
so i'm not sure if there's any other

1343
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,240
commenter question i i just see my

1344
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,839
slides nothing else on my screen

1345
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,240
can you hear me now

1346
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,319
yes

1347
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,720
yes i was wondering if

1348
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,720
uh because what if defining a format for

1349
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,480
a 2.54

1350
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,480
so i was just thinking is there a way to

1351
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,800
have just a separate bit

1352
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,280
in the uh a bit that does not exist

1353
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,319
today but you would put in a header

1354
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,480
that would indicate when you send

1355
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,960
something whether you send it

1356
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,559
from the perspective of

1357
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,040
dev or from the perspective of an app

1358
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,480
basically

1359
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,720
and so basically the guy who received

1360
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,640
that would look at the rule and say oh

1361
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,319
he has said that it's a dev so let me uh

1362
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,720
treat it as an app

1363
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,040
you see

1364
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,319
i mean we're not we're not necessarily

1365
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,200
working for legacy i mean classical lp

1366
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,400
so you're doing that for a new

1367
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,880
application

1368
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,839
yeah uh

1369
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:12,799
yeah i

1370
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,400
might need to figure out

1371
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,319
exactly all the details about that and

1372
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:20,160
whether it might be an issue or not but

1373
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,680
yeah i see the

1374
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,960
the idea

1375
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,280
so yeah let's definitely take it into

1376
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,000
account yeah

1377
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,520
okay do we have any more questions

1378
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,680
no

1379
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,480
so

1380
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,599
next

1381
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,200
okay can you

1382
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,319
present the

1383
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,920
slides

1384
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,400
so it's here it's just a draft we wrote

1385
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,760
with even in uh after an interim meeting

1386
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,599
where we have already this uh the

1387
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,240
discussion and it was very interesting

1388
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,559
because in in fact when chic has been

1389
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,799
designed it was really on on star

1390
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,240
topologies

1391
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,119
and

1392
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,480
we

1393
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,079
we improve a little bit for example in

1394
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,359
openshift

1395
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:06,240
uh

1396
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,319
what we we have is for example when you

1397
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,760
are in the car

1398
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,240
you have to select to which device you

1399
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,799
have to send this information

1400
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,480
and it is not specified in the rfc in

1401
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,880
rfc which is only the way you do the

1402
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,000
compression

1403
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,280
but now how you do the device selection

1404
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,880
so uh

1405
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,240
we in open cheek you see on the top left

1406
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,760
of the slide

1407
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,799
before the rule set of rules we have an

1408
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,520
indicator that say device id and this

1409
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,480
device id can be used to send to the

1410
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,839
real destination it can be for example

1411
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:46,400
lp1 on the device wy

1412
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,200
or here in open cheek we use also udp

1413
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,599
tunnels so we say you have to turn all

1414
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,760
this information to that address on that

1415
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,160
part sorry it's in ipv4

1416
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,240
and uh so we we have this and it means

1417
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,200
that

1418
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,559
the core can identify the device

1419
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,960
on the device when it answer either it's

1420
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,200
use the same technology for example

1421
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,160
laura one and then laura one is in

1422
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,240
charge to send it to the core

1423
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,119
or in the case of the tunnel since it's

1424
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,000
on internet internet we are using the

1425
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,160
address of the core the ip address of

1426
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,000
the core we identify

1427
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,559
so we can extend a little bit this so

1428
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,520
the next slide please

1429
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,319
pascal can you

1430
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,040
yes so in this in this case

1431
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,680
we introduce the device ids means how

1432
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,799
the core

1433
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,040
can join the device and we can also

1434
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,760
introduce a next stop but say how the

1435
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,160
device can join the core

1436
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,040
and this way we can have something that

1437
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,799
is uh

1438
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,640
less symmetric for example we can have

1439
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,280
devices that have several cores so

1440
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,760
that's the first case and in yellow we

1441
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,480
have a okay so for example a device can

1442
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,200
be

1443
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,040
viewed sometimes the communication can

1444
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,079
be viewed up or down depending the way

1445
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,440
you enter you select device and next up

1446
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,839
in the rule the only constraint in that

1447
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,839
case is that the rule id

1448
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,240
cannot be shared between these two set

1449
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,760
of rules

1450
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,359
so this is a way to introduce a

1451
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:22,799
mesh

1452
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:26,160
connectivity between device using shakes

1453
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,240
so that's just a proposal that comes

1454
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,200
from

1455
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,799
the discussion and i think we have to

1456
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,359
discuss more about that if

1457
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,598
it's interesting

1458
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,040
so thank you very much

1459
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,920
and uh sorry for my mic primer the mic

1460
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,680
just started to

1461
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,559
work

1462
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,119
let me for this meeting so i'll pick up

1463
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,680
a headset for my next meeting but i i

1464
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,839
could not reboot or try anything just

1465
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,920
now so

1466
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,760
okay so we are reaching the end of this

1467
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,720
meeting

1468
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,839
um

1469
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,760
great thanks for everybody

1470
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,079
joining online or coming to the to the

1471
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,119
meeting

1472
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,799
we've got a number of to-do's um on the

1473
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,680
sick fox side to uh

1474
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,000
validate the new proposals uh hot

1475
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,559
balance you know a little bit of edits

1476
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,200
and and dominic proposed to effectively

1477
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,440
uh make upon request if you're willing

1478
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,760
to to work that way

1479
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,599
and um

1480
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,520
the chairs would be

1481
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,760
asking for the world group last course

1482
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,359
in the workforce right after this

1483
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:42,720
meeting

1484
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,960
so thank you all and

1485
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,280
meet you virtually at the next lp1

1486
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,280
interim

1487
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,200
uh

1488
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,680
yes
