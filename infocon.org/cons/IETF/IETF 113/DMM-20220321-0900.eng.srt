so first thing uh blue sheets

44
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
i think how do we coordinate this any i

45
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,919
guess

46
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
the media will automatically record

47
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
everyone who dials in

48
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,719
are there bullshits in the room

49
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,080
uh if not there's a mobile app

50
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,960
there's like the uh the medeco light

51
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,240
you can use that can record your

52
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,960

53
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960

55
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
retweet this automatically

56
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
if there's no bluetooth in the room then

57
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840
um probably i would impress everyone to

58
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,680
sign into the medical light that way

59
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,759

60
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,680

call sometime last year but there have

108
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,440
been

109
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,840
two comments and concerns

110
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,240
so that's why we did not

111
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,958
we asked the authors and

112
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,799
the folks who provided the comments to

113
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,559
resolve the issues

114
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,320

i want to give the opportunity to the

123
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480

130
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
what what the authors believe with

131
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,000
respect to the states

132
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,160

136
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
an update on srv6 mobile user plan

137
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,680
so briefly to wake up a bit on the

138
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,519
estate um

139
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,080
so we started the working group alaska

140
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,560
in april last year

141
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,839
on revision 11. we had

142
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,279
a good amount of participation with many

143
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,200
comments and i really appreciated the

144
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
comments of everyone who have improved

145
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
the document

146
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,160
um

147
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,360
and well throughout the last itf-112

148
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,800
there were a number of issues that were

149
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,959
still pending and we believe that they

150
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,360
have been solved

151
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,800
nexus like this attorney

152
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,920
okay so one of the comments

153
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,760
that was outstanding it was the comment

154
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,680
from joe harper

155
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,880
related the sections 5.15.3

156
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,399
where basically we are well the document

157
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,839
is defining

158
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,880
um

159
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
or

160
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,200
well this defining how to

161
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,079
uh you could use the srv6 endpoint

162
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,440
behaviors which are defining the

163
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,079
document to build an srv6 mobile user

164
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,279
plan

165
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,079
um the view for the comment from joel it

166
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,240
was that these sections are not as

167
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,920
standard

168
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,839
and the discussion that we had around

169
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
them is that this text is providing

170
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,240
value to any operator who is deploying

171
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
this technology so we did not want to

172
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,079
remove the text

173
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,760
and so basically the solution that we

174
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,120
found was to add one small paragraph at

175
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,560
the beginning

176
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,079
just mentioning that these three

177
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,279
sections are merely informative

178
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,800
and so we have added one paragraph

179
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,959
about it

180
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,519
i believe joel is not

181
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,959
i don't know if you always here but

182
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,519
anyway um please review the paragraph

183
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,920
and personally if you want to change the

184
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
specific wording we will change it but

185
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,839
for the rest it should be good

186
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,640
um and then the other pending comment

187
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,959
that we had it was a few uh email

188
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,880
exchange with jeffrey

189
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,560
um and from these uh emulations with uh

190
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320
jeffrey there were a few editorial

191
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,800
things to change in the same report

192
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,680
and it has been the change

193
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,319
next to slides

194
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,560
so given that this draft has been well

195
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,079
the working group last call started in

196
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,480
april last year and given the the vast

197
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,120
amount of changes that we have done

198
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,800
on the drug

199
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,880
the authors believe that

200
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
it would be good to issue a second

201
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,040
working group last call

202
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
i don't know what is the view of the

203
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
work group search

204
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
and that's really

205
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,560
many

206
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,320
things it's free i don't know

207
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,600
but i use your

208
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,279
mouth power

209
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,519
yo thank you problem

210
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,639
thanks now

211
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,079
thank you thank you for your

212
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,440
presentation

213
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
so

214
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,920
there have been few other comments well

215
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,079
i think you know i thought um yeah i've

216
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
discussed with you and

217
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,320
other authors

218
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,120
so overall perspective we also wanted to

219
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
make sure you know from 3gpp point of

220
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,639
view

221
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,000
when we say

222
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,399
this is

223
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,279
the the interfaces that we refer to

224
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,720
right

225
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,639
it does not alter the definition of the

226
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,880
pgp right so

227
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,680
we wanted some convention some wordings

228
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,519
which says that

229
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,839
this is i.t of the version of the

230
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,040
interface right that way

231
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,880
it's not truly we are not altering the

232
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,160
pgp specifications but has been one uh

233
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,120
comment

234
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,000
any

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,120
any comments uh popular is exactly how

236
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,200
you know you have resolved that comment

237
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
and you share a bit more details

238
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,519
yeah sure um

239
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,600
so basically at the beginning of the

240
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
draft um i believe i don't know we call

241
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
it section four three um

242
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,440
we have paid particular attention to the

243
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
wording um and so basically what we said

244
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,040
is that we are going to use this

245
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
reference architecture the 3gpp

246
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,800
reference architecture

247
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,959
for 5g with the corresponding interfaces

248
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,959
references

249
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,199
however it is also specified in the in

250
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,440
the text that the

251
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
mechanisms that are defining this

252
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,639
document could be applicable to any

253
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,880
other mobile architecture

254
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,120
um

255
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,079
and and so basically throughout the

256
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,680
draft we have been paying

257
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,000
attention to the wording

258
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,920
and to make sure that this is generic

259
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,160
enough

260
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,959
okay so that that's a bit uh how we

261
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,359
solve it

262
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,639
okay

263
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,160
all right i think uh

264
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,760
we can review the text um and uh we can

265
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,800
take it from there but uh largely

266
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,680
the the issues that i am tracking so i

267
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,000
think hopefully you know is uh

268
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,360
addresses uh all those calls

269
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,199
i think uh

270
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,720
the next thing you know post idea

271
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,800
probably sometime next week i'm going to

272
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,279
issue in a second last stop

273
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,839
and to make sure

274
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,680

278
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
changes and you know acknowledge that

279
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,079
they're okay with it

280

281
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560

can you hear me

309
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,440
slightly your audio is coming out bit

310
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,600
low if you can speak out a little louder

311
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,000
or physical microphone please this is

312
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
better

313
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,000
marginally slightly

314
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,280
i don't know

315
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,839
maybe i'll speak as loud as i can

316
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,839
okay yeah this is better

317
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,280
it's better okay

318
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,400
so this is the mobility aware transport

319
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
network slicing for 5g

320
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,799
um

321
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,319
one second one second john sir santorum

322
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,319
are you going to share the slides or the

323
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,320
sharing i don't have slides history

324
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
it's a simple update that i can talk

325
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
through uh you know to

326
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,360
give what the changes were in

327
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,080
zero three versions

328
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,520
all right

329
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
okay so

330
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,160
they were the main comment from the last

331
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
meeting and uh

332
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,320
you know discussions were that

333
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,360
the draft text is all over the place and

334
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,600
uh that it needs to focus

335
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,799
so

336
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,160
and then there were some other comments

337
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,760
too which you know there were a couple

338
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,120
of others uh reference to drafts on

339
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,320
slices

340
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,679
and then there's a few miscellaneous

341
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,320
changes too so focusing on that first

342
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,840
one you know to correct the

343
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,320
fact that the text is all over the place

344
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,440
we

345
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,880
revised uh significant portions of the

346
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,080
introduction

347
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,039
and

348
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,080
there are two

349
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
main changes which i'll just talk

350
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,280
through

351
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,799
uh basically it's that a slice i mean we

352
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,679
we say water slices in 3gpp that it is a

353
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,440
logical chunk of 3gbp network resources

354
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
and how they're created and all of that

355
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,840
the text is in in the introduction

356
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,080
section

357
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,760
testing time because we can't hear will

358
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,320
you you keep cutting in and out

359
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,879
because it makes sense

360
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,640
yeah john i think uh i'm not sure here

361
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,400
i wonder if one of my colleagues is

362
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
there or

363
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,880
i can try to share my screen but

364
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,039

365
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,039

375
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,480

379
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,360
you're cutting in and out

380
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,760
i'm not sure what i can do about it

381
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
all right john anybody else is this

382
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,760
better you can do the presentation

383
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,840
audio is from your side is

384
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,600
horrible john there is no way we can

385
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,000
hear you anything

386
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,039
okay

387
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,720
then i guess i'll post these uh to the

388
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,000
mailing list

389
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,039
the changes that we've made

390
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,880
okay so

391
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,480
john will try again we'll move to the

392
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,960
next topic and see if something okay

393
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,120
okay in the meanwhile you'll be able to

394
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
resolve this right

395
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,000
okay

396
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,240
so

397
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,360
sort of songs

398
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,600
can folks in the room confirm whether

399
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
the issue was just with john's audio or

400
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,799
with all remote audio

401
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,400
so we can hear eric shree we could hear

402
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,720
and then he's gone and we could not hear

403
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,520
john at all

404
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,039
understood thank you

405
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,000
so the next presentation is uh

406
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,640
mobile user plane message encoding

407
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,080
this is an

408
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,879
individual id

409
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,799
yeah we can hear you

410
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,240
okay so uh good morning

411
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,240
uh

412
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,799
uh

413
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,960
in order to discuss about the

414
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,799
ufc fbi

415
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,158
pretty quickly next time

416
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,559
uh this is the change from piazza one to

417
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,760
delta

418
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,080
so

419
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,080
uh

420
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,679
therefore you can find a latest partner

421
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,640
so we attack

422
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
some

423
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,559
title

424
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,799
yeah so here's our next step

425
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,080
and also we are simply uh to cody

426
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,120
any comment

427
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,600
yeah

428
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,799
so

429
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,960
let's

430
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,240
so yeah this uh document has been uh in

431
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,640
uh listening discussions uh for a while

432
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
i think

433
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,279
it'd like to definitely share

434
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,799
adoption card

435
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,039
but before that we just want to make

436
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,720
sure

437
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
you know people have read

438
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,360
and you know wanted to see their views

439
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,520
probably

440
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,960
yeah

441
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,159
dean has joined the call yeah

442
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,919
your question actually i have a question

443
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,159
we cannot hear anything in the room what

444
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,760
is being presented

445
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,000
so sri you're coming in and out but the

446
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,480
presenters we cannot hear them anything

447
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,159
so whatever is being presented we don't

448
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,320
know what is being talked about

449
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,279
oh is it okay

450
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,720
i'm not sure

451
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,480
yeah shri can you hear can you hear the

452
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,760
presenters

453
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,600
yeah we cannot i i can barely hear it's

454
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,799
not coming out clearly i agree yes

455
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,840
so we have we have that the same problem

456
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
okay i understand i understand in the

457
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,880
room it's much harder for us to follow

458
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,799
because of the audio we cannot put like

459
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,200
a headset and then trying to focus on

460
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,880
that one

461
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,679
no no i understand i understand

462
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,360
so i'll try to find someone in the knock

463
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,679
on slack to see if they can

464
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,279
come diagnose what's going on

465
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,480
but i don't know if they're going to get

466
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,640
there

467
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,960
see eric i'm not able to figure out

468
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,600
whether it's a tool problem or is it you

469
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,799
know the individual session issue

470
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,960
that's fun

471
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,880
it seems everyone can hear you sree so

472
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,000
maybe

473
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,159
we can hear eric we can't hear anybody

474
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,159

477
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,960

478
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,720

479
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,880
could hear you that time john

480
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,799

481
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,559

482
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,360

let me give an update on this

508
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,600
so this document went through several

509
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
revisions

510
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,760
uh there have been some discussions i

511
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,720
think

512
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,960
we'd like to you know issue an adoption

513
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,080

514
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,760
working group

515
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,200
for email

516
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,360
now it's difficult for me to track you

517
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,200
know as you know who read the document

518
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,080

519
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,399
so i'm going to do it online we are

520
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,840
going to the chairs are going to issue

521
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,159
an adoption call on this

522
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,320
so but if there any comments from the

523
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,960
room or from remote participants please

524
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,399
speak up

525
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,600
again the queue is open now

526
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,520
all right since there's no truly there's

527
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,440
no presentation you know nobody probably

528
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,600
nobody has the questions so we'll move

529
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,399
to the next topic

530
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,520
okay let me share

531
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,600
supervisor playing architecture

532
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,440
for the emancipation

533
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,840
this is very

534
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,799
brief update here

535
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,840
we made

536
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,279
it revision

537
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,880
from the last item meeting we have a

538
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,960
seriously version now

539
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,240
the main update from ufc version was

540
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,000
simplified

541
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,360
for the uh scripture

542
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,039
uh what

543
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,279
the thought for using what the

544
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,919
description description

545
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,120
looks like

546
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,840
to first update the drop test

547
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,360
requirement

548
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,480
actually

549
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,960
there one person has some

550
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,320
idea to utilize excel policy

551
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,600
but um

552
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,720
some of this questions we may we

553
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,799
understand that the authority doesn't

554
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,159
need to be

555
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,440
involved

556
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,679
in the architecture so we drop the

557
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,600
electrical receive them

558
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,279
uh binaural fit as a network for session

559
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,159
trucks

560
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,600
from a drought

561
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,320
not being a story

562
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,960
the second update the

563
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,200
architecture description

564
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,000
uh

565
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,840
we have a bunch of detect updates but

566
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,399
the fundamental aspects that doesn't

567
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,559
change

568
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,679
so one

569
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,880
the main change was the description was

570
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,600
focus on the segments instead of the

571
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,440
role of the node

572
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,240
that helps object editors dispose

573
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,480
description and much simpler

574
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,200
the second point when the update was

575
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,320
case and

576
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,399
we made the

577
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,320
mep segment

578
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,200
will be

579
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,440
interwoven direct segment

580
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,960
b25

581
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,840
and also the te finity can accommodate

582
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,399
both interwars and direct treatment

583
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,600
or simultaneously

584
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,600
the other thing is about information

585
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,720
so we

586
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,000
clarified the two discover leaders for

587
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,520
interwork on a direct segment

588
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,559
and with question transformation

589
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,840
we briefly uh describe

590
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,080
what the session transfer rules are

591
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,000
allowed to look like in the zero one bar

592
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,039
and well now this gives you have three

593
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,600
technical type one type of questions

594
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,240
from the round

595
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,279
and we have to simply that um

596
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,640
idea

597
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,760
using extended community to indicate its

598
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,559
direct premium

599
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
that was clarified and also the last

600
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,080
thing we had

601
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,360
protocol developed

602
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,640
in a

603
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,679
separate

604
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,919
document

605
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,399
the document specified the

606
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,399
start new safety

607
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,360
to put the accession transfer

608
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,720
information

609
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,679
to bgpr

610
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,080
but all of the

611
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,960
updates we made

612
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,170
from the

613
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,840
[Music]

614
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,519
previous that's all thank you

615
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,240
any questions

616
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,600
oh uh next one next step

617
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,919
maybe we have

618
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,120
uh some

619
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
more clarification

620
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,320
in next division

621
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,039
and also if he needed

622
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,480
more

623
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,440
uh you stay for

624
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,840
some uh helpful

625
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,879
here situation

626
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,279
so this document is again an individual

627
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,440
uh id

628
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,640
as uh

629
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,159
saying we need to issue a

630
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,039
validation adoption call at some point

631
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,440
so i'd like to see more discussions on

632
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,760
the in the mailer you know there haven't

633
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,720
been more many on this topic so i think

634
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,919
uh

635
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,240
maybe i think secretary san and other

636
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,360
authors

637
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,880
we may want to some trigger some

638
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,039
discussions to you know

639
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,440
that will help us you know

640
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,120
set the ground for the

641
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,679
uh issuing an option called

642
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,840
so i think yeah

643
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,440
anyways question

644
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,039
how did you work on that

645
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,760
thank you so much and

646
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,120
any questions

647
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,559
from either

648
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,000
any questions from the folks in the room

649
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,440
okay if not anybody

650
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,600
any remote participant anybody any

651
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,158
anyone has any questions

652
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,259
[Music]

653
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,519
yes your question on the previous

654
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,720
document

655
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,440
no yes exactly well actually i raised my

656
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,760
hand and tried to ask questions uh since

657
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,719
you did not see my hand so

658
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,918
okay

659
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,599
yeah please

660
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,960
yeah yeah i have

661
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,119
some questions here it seems like i only

662
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,000
have a lot of apples here by the way

663
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,040
um

664
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,079
i only read through the

665
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,440
the version zero one now in zero three

666
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,599
and it seems um

667
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,440
because when i read uh

668
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,440
zero one i got a question on the mup the

669
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,359
controller itself

670
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,119
instead of about

671
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,079
basically it force uh my question focus

672
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,239
on the

673
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,719
interaction between the ip of the

674
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,960
transport domain and the

675
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,399
the 5g

676
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,200
mup plan

677
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,119
here is a 0 3 since you add more message

678
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,359
types or you try to handle all the

679
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,440
signaling things

680
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,760
my question actually is

681
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,280
for your mup uh the controller

682
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,320
and

683
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
how are you going to you know basically

684
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,040
for the 5gs system the architecture

685
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,960
itself

686
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,920
and

687
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,880
i really want to know how are you going

688
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,920
to put your uh the mup controller are

689
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,440
you going to consider us as a

690
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,520
nf network function or you consider us a

691
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,640
application function so yes

692
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
or something else because

693
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,839
it's going to

694
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,800
introduce

695
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,599
some

696
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,680
complexity

697
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,000
for the 5g as

698
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,119
a control player so

699
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,960
so basically my question might not be

700
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,079
related to d03 itself basically it's

701
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,520
related to

702
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,240
how are you going to integrate

703
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,200
uh the mup the the controller all the

704
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,160
things

705
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
with the 5gs

706
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,640
functions

707
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,520
thank you very much for your question

708
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,280
this is saturday i'm not trying to

709
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,119
answer your question

710
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,680
um as we described in what well um

711
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,599
it's obvious map architecture is

712
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,880
independent from any

713
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,920
specific mobility management

714
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,640
architecture

715
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,520
not only for the 5d but also the idf

716
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,720
architecture payment for example

717
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,119
integration disability map

718
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,960
into specific

719
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,320
uh mobile satellite cryptography how to

720
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,079
describe this document

721
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,160
map controller just provide the app api

722
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
to receive the obsession with motion

723
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,960
from outside of the um

724
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,800
map

725
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,599
so

726
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,119
maybe

727
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,000
someone wants to integrate

728
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,839
it's a big map

729
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,240
into existing or future mobility

730
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,440
architecture

731
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,359
so

732
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,280
it

733
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,240
makes

734
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
someone

735
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,440
define or implement some idea to

736
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
integrate the

737
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,720
database enough at that time

738
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,400
so far

739
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
it is out of scope of this document

740
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,320
in terms of the output

741
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,960
okay

742
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,599
now it's uh clear to me since the

743
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,320
rest of the zero one i always had this

744
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,440
question

745
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,040
no i know yeah

746
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,359
yeah okay observing from

747
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,280
your proposal right now so okay thank

748
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,320
you yeah

749
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,000
we described the 5g other examples

750
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,920
for the ease of the understanding of

751
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,000
their system

752
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,720
maybe possible

753
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,079
yeah you know it seems like for the of

754
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,400
operator this type of things it's uh

755
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,880
it's not very trivial to introduce so

756
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,560
that's why i have this question in my

757
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,520
mind so yep thank you very much

758
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,320
thank you

759
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,800
thank you tianji

760
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,000
any anyone any other questions i see

761
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
nobody

762
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,880
either the microphone or in the queue

763
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,119
all right

764
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,119
we move on to the next topic please

765
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,240
next one is mobile user plane evolution

766
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,599
this is a new document from jeffrey

767
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,320
and folks

768
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,160
jeffrey

769
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,000
yes can you hear me

770
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,800
yes clearly okay i'm speaking with my

771
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,800
mask on how does that affect the audio

772
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,440
it's slower it's coming out okay okay

773
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,400
um how much time do we lose did we lose

774
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,119
a lot of time because i'm if i did then

775
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,839
i may skip some slides it's fine i think

776
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,000
it's fine we should we should be able to

777
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,839
yeah okay thank you

778
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,800
so i'm going to talk about uh two drops

779
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,280
here uh with course skier and and changi

780
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,839
next slide please

781
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,320
so

782
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,720
the purposes of the first draft is to

783
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,320
give

784
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,280
overview on the 5g user plan

785
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,640
and talk about the trend of distribution

786
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,280
and alternative implementation this is

787
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,680
to set the stage for the discussion in

788
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,079
the next draft

789
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,200
so the next draft is

790
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,160
about

791
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,599
potentially

792
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,760
in the next generation let's for example

793
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,880
6e

794
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,839
to uh integrate uh

795
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,880
the genome b and upf function together

796
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,599
uh some thoughts uh i i have i have

797
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,440
exchanged with some

798
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,760
other people uh with my co-authors

799
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,800
we want to socialize this idea first um

800
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,760
the work would have to be done in 3gpp

801
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,240
we're not trying to do the 3gpp work in

802
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,520
iatf

803
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,640
but we want to socialize idea first

804
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,560
among the people who have

805
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,560
familiar ways and friendly with active

806
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,040
wireline technologies

807
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,440
if we get enough support then we would

808
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,640
bring to 3gpp

809
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,720
there

810
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,960
so that's the intention here

811
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,440
next slide

812
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,800
so this is a picture of the 5g user plan

813
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,599
on the left side we have the ue

814
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,960
and then next to the general b

815
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,000
and maybe intermediate upf and finally

816
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,839
anchoring upf

817
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,839
so from the ue to the genome b is the

818
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,000
radio layer protocols

819
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,480
and then from the genome to upf we use

820
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,240
gtpu

821
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,920
there is relay going on between the uh

822
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,160
radio layer

823
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,000
radio broadcast layers and then and gdpu

824
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,400
and the relay going on in intermediate

825
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,040
upf and finally it reaches the anchoring

826
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,800
upf we decap the gdpu tunnel we do the

827
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,359
routing switching

828
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,400
and then

829
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,640
send the traffic to the dn

830
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,119
um here by routing and switching i mean

831
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,520
that the traffic folding is based on the

832
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,440
ip header or ethernet header of the

833
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
that is below the

834
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,079
gdp header

835
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,800
next slide please

836
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,760
so

837
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,040
with edge computings nowadays upfs are

838
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
being distributed closer to the general

839
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,599
beats and

840
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,040
as a result

841
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,440
the data networks are also distributed

842
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,160
to

843
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,400
uh to those sites to host the edge

844
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,760
resources

845
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,200
and that means that

846
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,599
the data networks are implemented as a

847
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,520
vpn as vpns for intersect connections

848
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,800
while the the central upfs

849
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,960
can remain they could be they could

850
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
actually be removed

851
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,319
and

852
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,960
with distributed upfs

853
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,040
the persistent ip addresses

854
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,839
can be provided even if the ue is

855
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,680
re-anchored from one

856
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,880
upf to another this is the down by

857
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,280
host routes in the data network in the

858
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,880
data network vpns it's just like a mac

859
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,160
address

860
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,560
routes for for the for the internet case

861
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,680
this

862
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,119
allows complete local breakouts

863
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,839
of the traffic to local uh to uh local

864
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,480
data networks that are interconnected

865
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,680
and this simplifies and also optimize

866
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,680
the edge computing

867
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,000
broadcast broadcast service and land

868
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,160
type services

869
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,680
so you can see that in the picture

870
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,400
we have the

871
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,760
on the right side of the transport

872
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,520
network it provides vpn services on p1p2

873
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,040
we have vr apps uh vrf1 and vf2 for

874
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,040
local data network networks uh

875
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,400
respectively and then there is a vp3

876
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,040
it also has a corresponding vpns uh

877
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,839
apps

878
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,680
for the central data network

879
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,040
which could be uh

880
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,560
internet itself

881
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,760
um

882
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,079
so um

883
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,160
that nothing nothing really changes

884
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,119
except that the upfs are distributed

885
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,839
next side please

886
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,680
so um there are

887
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,079
also there are at least

888
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,160
in this dmm working group we have been

889
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,720
talking about alternatives to

890
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,680
the upf and the gdpu

891
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,119
implementation

892
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,839
some operators and vendors are actually

893
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,000
pushing for for this alternative

894
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,839
implementation deployments

895
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,839
this is under the hood

896
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,800
no 3gpp architectural signal changes are

897
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,119
done

898
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,640
one example is the srv6

899
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,800
replacing gdp tunnel

900
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,359
that the draft the pablo was talking

901
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,839
about

902
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,480
um and the other one is the srv6 map

903
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,760
architecture

904
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,560
that uh satoru just talked about uh

905
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,960
which is srv6 specific

906
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,640
it's kind of is really just a

907
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,319
router-based and

908
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,680
partial implementation of the

909
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,640
distributed upf uk

910
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,440
that's how how i see it next slide

911
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,760
please

912
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,800
in particular for the srv6 map

913
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,200
architecture and this actually sort of

914
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,000
uh answers the question from from tng

915
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,440
at least the way i see it

916
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,400
the

917
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,800
collection of distributed map controller

918
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,040
map gateway and rpe

919
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,280
appears as a

920
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,960
as a single

921
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,880
and central uh upf to the smf

922
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,920
that's it nothing else changes

923
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,920
it is an alternative

924
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,760
to the distributed distributed

925
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
traditional upf

926
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,119
um

927
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,520
another observation i want to make here

928
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,720
is that

929
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,000
the

930
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,119
srv6 map architecture or solution

931
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,440
is actually a sr agnostic

932
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,560
it can be

933
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,960
it can work with

934
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,400
mpos with or with rsr

935
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,440
in fact

936
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,240
for the pgp signaling draft

937
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,400
that that goes again together with the

938
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,839
srv6 mod map architecture

939
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,160
um there is uh

940
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,760
another version that is sr agnostic

941
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,480
based on that uh

942
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,160
existing draft with minimum changes

943
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,880
i want to point out this is so far just

944
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,599
for partial upf functions

945
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,040
if uh someone wants to

946
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,560
to once need

947
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,880
needs a complete set of upf functions

948
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,760
then

949
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,280
either

950
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,680
that architecture can be extended

951
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,839
or just deploy traditional but

952
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,319
distributed upfs

953
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,640
again this is just the

954
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,440
overview and summarize all the

955
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,520
5g user plan

956
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,400
options and then trends things like that

957
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,200
next site please

958
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,240
now finally i'm getting to the uh second

959
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,280
drafts i mentioned earlier

960
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,480
what if

961
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,760
in the next generation for example in 6g

962
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,200
we completely integrate the genome b and

963
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,319
the upf function together

964
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,280
yeah

965
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,040
this is not

966
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,560
for 5g at all

967
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,960
it's a potential for 6g

968
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,760
if we can get

969
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,440
enough support then we can bring to 3gpp

970
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,400
here

971
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,440
basically the geno b and upfr

972
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,520
integrate into a single large logical

973
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,280
entity

974
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,160
the

975
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,359
pdo

976
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,480
session

977
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,520
terminates at the integrated function

978
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,520
and the routing switching happens right

979
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,599
there

980
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,040
this is the

981
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,960
the picture

982
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,280
that you can see that it simplifies from

983
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,839
the previous pictures

984
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,119
what happens here is basically the 3gpp

985
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,000
slash wireless technologies are used to

986
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,440
connect the

987
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,280
ue to that's a

988
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,040
new integrator

989
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,160
end up

990
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,760
entity

991
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,240
and then from there on it's just ihf

992
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,720
slash wireless technologies

993
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,598
next slide please

994
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,800
so

995
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,559
a big question is why bother

996
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,680
the main the main reason for for for

997
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,480
doing this is that this is a simplified

998
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,640
flattened network architecture

999
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,000
uh with 3gpp and

1000
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,079
technology for radio access and ihf

1001
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,680
technology for the rest it allows

1002
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,440
seamless integration of vana and

1003
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,520
wireless services and i'm not talking

1004
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,680
about www.c

1005
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,440
it's really for that

1006
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,680
edge computing multicast broadcast

1007
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,000
service and non-type services other

1008
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,480
things we can do seamless integration

1009
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,160
for between the wireless and wireless

1010
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,599
services

1011
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:54,720
um

1012
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,839
besides

1013
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,760
uh when when we integrate those two

1014
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,440
entities together

1015
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,760
we get that both the signaling and data

1016
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,160
plane can be optimized

1017
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,480
currently we need a separate and two m4

1018
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,880
signaling uh to the genome b and to the

1019
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,240
upf

1020
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,200
um

1021
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,000
and

1022
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,880
there is a need for the ggbt u tunneling

1023
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,880
between the two devices

1024
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,960
when we combine them together we do not

1025
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,559
need a separate and two and four

1026
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,599
signaling and we do not need that uh

1027
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,119
separate connection

1028
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,079
uh between the a and upf no matter how

1029
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,359
close they are

1030
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,599
uh if the the large the two

1031
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,079
entities are logically separate there

1032
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,440
will be a

1033
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,760
connection between them it could be

1034
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,680
internal connection

1035
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,880
um also um

1036
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,200
because the now the network functions

1037
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,680
are more and more virtualized uh

1038
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,480
um

1039
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,960
this is actually very feasible to do it

1040
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,520
on the servers that host

1041
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,640
the services currently and in fact even

1042
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,440
the vpn pes could be integrated into

1043
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,240
data and app devices that's as an

1044
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,960
implementation choice

1045
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,440
next slide please

1046
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,000
i do want to point out there are there

1047
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,160
are still cases where

1048
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,359
uh separate upfs may still be needed um

1049
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,760
for example homology roaming

1050
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,319
m and v n o or

1051
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,400
just sometimes you you need a upf for

1052
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,599
uh to connect for multiple genobies uh

1053
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,040
in proximity

1054
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,839
um

1055
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:34,640
when

1056
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,440
when there is that need that uh

1057
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,079
the a and upf uh connection can can be

1058
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,720
the gdpu tunnels or it could be ihf

1059
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,200
pseudo-wires everything is possible this

1060
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,880
is just that when you do need to

1061
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,839
separate them it can still work

1062
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:50,720
but

1063
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,359
when when you can integrate them

1064
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,720
integrating them will have advantages

1065
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,520
next slide please

1066
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,880
so

1067
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,520
these two drafts are both informational

1068
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,160
the first one just to

1069
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,000
give the background the set stage for

1070
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,160
the discussion in the next in the second

1071
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,680
draft

1072
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,800
that talks about

1073
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,839
the potential integration and

1074
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,359
again

1075
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,160
we

1076
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,559
the purpose of this is to socialize the

1077
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,640
thoughts um

1078
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,359
i

1079
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,160
i want to get your comments and if

1080
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,559
you're sympathetic to this idea let's

1081
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,960
talk and that's called collaborate and

1082
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,640
if this makes sense

1083
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,040
if we get enough support then we can

1084
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,040
bring this to uh to 3gpp

1085
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,200
okay

1086
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,520
thank you

1087
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,839
okay thank you for your presentation

1088
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,400
so i think a few questions before i open

1089
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,160
up the mic right i think

1090
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,000
i do want to say a few things

1091
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,640
this working group we truly don't have

1092
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,119
the complete charter to go change 3gbp

1093
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,240
architecture

1094
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,119
we are generally open to taking a work

1095
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,599
that allows us to use ietf tools and

1096
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,599
improve the system

1097
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,559
but it's not exactly we are not we are

1098
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,160
not chartered to change the 3gb

1099
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,559
interfaces right with that

1100
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,359
you know keeping that comment in mind

1101
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,240
i think

1102
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,680
you know i think you talked about number

1103
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,480
of things right collocation of gnb and

1104
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,280
upf and a few other points right i think

1105
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,400
can you

1106
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,960
comment on like what exactly the changes

1107
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,920
that you are suggesting right

1108
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,480
are these changes you know fundamentally

1109
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,400
to alter the 3gpp system or or is it

1110
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,280
about

1111
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,599
using ietf tools

1112
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,920
to improve the system and any comments

1113
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,160
anything

1114
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,760
on that on that aspect

1115
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,440
so

1116
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,480
today

1117
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,319
um

1118
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,680
the the uh

1119
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,319
in the centralized upf um the gdp

1120
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,880
tunnels gpu tunnels are used to bring

1121
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,359
the sessions from genome b to the to the

1122
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,520
central upf

1123
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,760
and in the distributed case

1124
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,280
especially in that srv6 map architecture

1125
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,839
we are sort of breaking the central upf

1126
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,640
into distributed ones and but still

1127
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,200
there is still a separation between the

1128
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,440
genome and upf

1129
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,640
so if we could um

1130
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,240
convince that uh

1131
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,839
3gbp that

1132
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,200
we can actually um integrate the genome

1133
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,559
b and the upf then yes the ietf

1134
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,920
technology

1135
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,480
will will uh will be used to connect

1136
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,680
those uh all those uh uh uh

1137
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,480
integrated devices together at the uh

1138
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,359
data

1139
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,359
network level the pdo sessions

1140
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,000
terminates at the end up and then from

1141
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,319
their point on it's uh

1142
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,319
uh it's itf uh two uh technologies it's

1143
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,240
this is very much like

1144
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,640
you connect your pc to a router using

1145
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,760
ethernet

1146
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,720
and then the rest is just the wireline

1147
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,200
networks right it's here you replace the

1148
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,000
uh

1149
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,160
ethernet cable

1150
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,319
with the radio access and the rest will

1151
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,079
be the same as

1152
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,359
the rest will be just a wireline

1153
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,119
technologies

1154
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,400
okay

1155
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,240
so do you see any relevance of this work

1156
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,240
to the ietf mobility architectures you

1157
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,839
know if you look at over the years we

1158
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,000
have standardized many protocols you

1159
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,599
know the idf mobility architecture is

1160
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,400
based on mobile ip v6 premium basics

1161
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,200
right

1162
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,240
any comments on applicability of this to

1163
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,599
that architecture

1164
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,760
um so

1165
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,720
um i just i mentioned that

1166
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,839
i'm here basically a socialist this idea

1167
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,920
uh i don't expect the work to be done in

1168
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,640
this working group okay got it

1169
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,680
okay thank you so much yeah any i think

1170
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,640
let's open up the queue uh let's

1171
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,480
any comments questions

1172
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,559
anybody

1173
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,040
oh yeah

1174
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,520
yeah first let's start with uh

1175
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,240
[Music]

1176
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,479
yeah

1177
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,880
oh um actually

1178
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,040
the

1179
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,520
i know you can speak up yeah

1180
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,559
everybody use google products

1181
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:43,599
okay

1182
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,400
you can hear me now yeah good yes okay

1183
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,520
thank you for

1184
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,200
interesting

1185
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,839
thought-provoking presentation i have a

1186
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,640
couple of comments to it first

1187
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,520
i'm comparing the proposals what exists

1188
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,799
in 5g not 6g because it's still pretty

1189
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,680
much underworks so first of all in 5g

1190
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,599
it's already possible to co-locate

1191
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,200
intermittent upf iupf with the access

1192
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,079
node or gene or v that's already a

1193
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,440
possibility

1194
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,760
therefore it seems that bit of radio run

1195
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,880
to go to that direction

1196
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,799
but then

1197
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,119
of course this intermittent upf assumes

1198
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,960
that there would be this psa

1199
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,000
uh but if you and your proposal is

1200
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,359
moving esa

1201
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,079
to the access mode but if you do that

1202
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,079
i i i'm wondering how how would you

1203
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,880
handle then multi-access scenarios for

1204
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,359
instance interworking

1205
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,160
with

1206
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,839
non-cheat non-3gpp

1207
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,400
interfaces this is not clear for

1208
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,720
to me secondly it seems that this is

1209
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,160
impacting 5g

1210
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,640
quality of service

1211
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,680
morale

1212
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,200
and

1213
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,920
related to that is that that

1214
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,079
you could of course imagine to build

1215
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,440
this 5g

1216
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,240
quality of service model into the

1217
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,880
t note b but if you do that then you

1218
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,640
enter up into

1219
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,480
security problems

1220
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,280
in comparison what exists today namely

1221
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,960
that that now

1222
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,200
access nodes will know the subscriptions

1223
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,520
and and the user ids which typically are

1224
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,400
hidden

1225
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,880
from the access network because we have

1226
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,680
this notion of access network sharing

1227
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,200
these are my my comments

1228
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,440
thank you hannah

1229
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,680
jeffrey

1230
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,599
so um

1231
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,319
the first one the co-locating of geno b

1232
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,760
and upf function

1233
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,599
and yes

1234
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,480
you can do that today

1235
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,000
but

1236
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,880
even with a co-located functions uh

1237
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,280
you still need separate n2 and m4

1238
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,680
signaling and you still need that uh

1239
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,400
connection between them and so

1240
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,440
by

1241
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,440
actually combining them in

1242
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,040
integrate them together into a single

1243
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,119
entity you will simply

1244
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,839
optimize both the signaling and data

1245
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,640
plan

1246
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,799
that that's the uh

1247
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:17,119
that that's the reason i we want to have

1248
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,280
this option

1249
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,960
about the security uh of

1250
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,559
having the uh

1251
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,079
subsequent information available on glob

1252
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,559
the impact of security um

1253
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,240
i indeed

1254
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,760
have not

1255
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,400
considered the curve carefully i will

1256
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,440
look into that further

1257
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,799
okay how about the multi-access support

1258
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,880
can you comment that

1259
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,760
multi-access

1260
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,200
you mean the

1261
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,920
nazi gpp access

1262
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,680
um yes yes

1263
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,319
um i would think uh i would think that

1264
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,839
it is the same um

1265
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,240
to me the only difference is whether

1266
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,119
it's it comes in on a radio

1267
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,240
link or on some other

1268
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,280
methods

1269
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,839
the idea is that whatever

1270
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,599
however they come in

1271
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:16,559
and

1272
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:17,680
today

1273
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,359
where you today just

1274
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,839
related to a gtpu tunnel you will just

1275
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,599
terminate right there and go into

1276
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,680
routine switching so it should not

1277
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,000
matter whether it's a 3gp or an 3gbpxs

1278
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,880
okay thank you

1279
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,920
let's continue on the mailing list

1280
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,359
yeah i think uh

1281
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,440
this uh this is a good topic i think

1282
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,040
yeah let's uh

1283
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,640
take these discussions to the mailing

1284
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,480
list i think uh android some great

1285
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,400
comments on not gpp access and other

1286
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,440
things

1287
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,839
overall yeah i think uh let's see the

1288
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,079
relevance of this work to this

1289
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,280
this i dm working

1290
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,680
any other questions

1291
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,640
uh yes i had a few comments uh but yeah

1292
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,440
please

1293
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,960
yeah yeah please go ahead

1294
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,079
okay thanks

1295
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,240
uh somewhat similar observations um as

1296
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,359
hanu but

1297
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,000
the focus i thought in the draft

1298
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,119
was to emphasize on the routing aspects

1299
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,000
of these upf and

1300
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,040
am

1301
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,760
but i was wondering about things like

1302
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,520
for example qos

1303
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,079
and the aspects defined in 5g so for

1304
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,960
example even in release 18 they're going

1305
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,799
to work on further extending qos in xrm

1306
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,319
and others

1307
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:55,440
but even the standard 5g

1308
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,240
qos aspects need to be considered

1309
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,319
so that's one aspect

1310
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,640
and then the other one is about access

1311
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,040
control and permissions especially when

1312
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,799
you come to things like network sharing

1313
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:09,520
so

1314
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,640
you know if if there are multiple

1315
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,839
operators

1316
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:14,960
sharing

1317
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,319
resources

1318
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,559
then those aspects have also got to be

1319
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,119
considered and i think that third aspect

1320
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,520
may be more if mobility management is

1321
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,880
impacted and

1322
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,200
perhaps it's simpler but it's need to be

1323
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,200
discussed in the draft

1324
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,119
um i can post maybe a little more

1325
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,559
detailed comments in the interest of

1326
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,960
time and on the mailing press okay

1327
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,880
yeah that's a good idea john thank you

1328
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,319
for your comments i think john if you

1329
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,680
can open up

1330
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,760
you know this on the mailer i think that

1331
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,119
will be great yeah

1332
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,760
uh we'll you know plug the queue here i

1333
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,839
think uh dean uh next and after that

1334
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,839
louise here

1335
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,280
so uh

1336
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,640
i really like the draft and i and i'm

1337
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,920
i'm

1338
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,599
i want to support it

1339
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,240
because what uh jeff is bringing out

1340
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,440
here

1341
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,640
is the simplifying the routing

1342
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,400
in the 5g

1343
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,039
user plane he's not changing any parts

1344
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,559
of the of the

1345
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,119
upf control plane he's not changing any

1346
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,720
one of the

1347
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,160
uh

1348
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,799
mobility signaling interfaces

1349
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:21,839
he just wants to terminate

1350
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:22,799
the

1351
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:26,319
data plane packets as close as possible

1352
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,400
to the wire line

1353
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,799
we know when the when it enters the wire

1354
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,680
line architecture and then put it out

1355
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,640
there

1356
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,440
as a ip packet

1357
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,760
the previous examples are trying to

1358
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,160
replace one tunneling technology with

1359
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,400
the another tunneling technology and i

1360
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,640
don't see that as a progress we are just

1361
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,480
replacing this one thing

1362
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,640
with the other thing and we are staying

1363
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,559
with the same mechanism

1364
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,640
this is differentiating that

1365
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,799
once it hits a wire line we are not

1366
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:57,920
continuing

1367
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,640
on the free gpp architecture we can

1368
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,720
continue with the pure ip architecture

1369
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,039
that we can then decide what do we want

1370
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,039
on the qos part

1371
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,680
the data plane qos we know how to handle

1372
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,640
that

1373
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,119
on the security part we also know how to

1374
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,160
handle

1375
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,440
you know the

1376
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,599
the data plan security yes there are

1377
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,359
some

1378
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,920
issues that could be between the user

1379
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,760
plane that says in the sorry the control

1380
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,119
plane that stays within the 3gpp part

1381
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,079
but

1382
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,960
if you apply a pure cups architecture

1383
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,880
where you have one controller with

1384
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,520
multiple user plane elements this is

1385
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,440
exactly what jeff is proposing he's

1386
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,000
saying like we will continue to have the

1387
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,240
upf control plane

1388
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,480
centralized we will just have multiple

1389
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,319
data planes that will be exit points

1390
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,720
with the prp traffic so

1391
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,599
from

1392
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,319
from all the proposals i you know this

1393
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,400
the one that i see that is

1394
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,319
most simplified and enables us to do

1395
01:03:58,319 --> 01:03:59,839
routing

1396
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,480
in in in this also

1397
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,599
work helps with the mobility aspects for

1398
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,280
the death net for the you know for the

1399
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,160
net networking group

1400
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,680
okay

1401
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,880
thank you dean

1402
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,480
uh next

1403
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,680
we'll uh

1404
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,400
we'll not we'll go to the next uh

1405
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,680
comment of

1406
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,960
lewis is

1407
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,920
next in the queue yeah thank you so

1408
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,559
probably another scenario to look at

1409
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,400
somehow seeing the same problem from a

1410
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,839
different angle would be in the case of

1411
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,440
the radio functional split where we

1412
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,440
centralized some part of the

1413
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,119
of the of the radio the baseball unit

1414
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,799
and so which is naturally being

1415
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,520
centralized so probably collocating also

1416
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,000
with the cu the the upf could be the

1417
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,760
advantages so it's another way of

1418
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,319
looking at the problem i think

1419
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,799
okay thank you luis i think the key

1420
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,559
thing is we want to make sure you know

1421
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,160
we are not seeing you know we change the

1422
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,640
3gbr picture here let's understand it if

1423
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,079
it's more on the

1424
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:58,319
routing side on the n6 side i don't know

1425
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,640
what what are the implications but we

1426
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,039
need we need careful analysis and then

1427
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,039
based on this if it's relevant we can

1428
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,839
take it up here

1429
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,599
uh how do i close the mic but you can

1430
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:10,960
quickly if it's a quick comment please

1431
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,039
respond yeah i love you

1432
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,280
yeah okay so this is not changing the

1433
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,440
upf architecture this is just applying

1434
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,039
the cups for the upf and that is legal

1435
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,520
by the free gpp that is supported by you

1436
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,960
it's you can apply caps to upf

1437
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,160
so

1438
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,079
this proposal is completely within the

1439
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,920
3gpp you know like framework given

1440
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,400
framework the current architecture

1441
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,520
okay all right thank you luis

1442
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,640
i know

1443
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,480
yes

1444
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,039
again but this looks simple because you

1445
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,520
haven't yet hit a difficult part for

1446
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,280
instance this

1447
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,039
multicast

1448
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,680
demonstrates very well difficult if if

1449
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,240
you push the multicast server next to

1450
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,000
the access and and you make a handover

1451
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
you are

1452
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,319
you are making the handover signaling

1453
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,359
more complicated same happens in

1454
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,599
other scenarios as well we need to have

1455
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:08,640
this

1456
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,920
psa

1457
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,720
anchor higher up in the hierarchy in

1458
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,119
order to preserve the existing mobility

1459
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,119
signaling

1460
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,760
because we have to repeat some few

1461
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,920
presentations we'll see if that happens

1462
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,480
yeah so thank you everybody i think

1463
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,319
there's some good level of interest for

1464
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,559
this i think uh we'll uh

1465
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,960
do this in the mail in the mailing list

1466
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,119
next topic is uh we move to the next

1467
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,440
presentation again thank you presenters

1468
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,039
who present us for the previous topic

1469
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,039
and uh and all the feedback

1470
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,520
next one is 5g distributed ups for the

1471
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,760
5g multicast and broadcast services

1472
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,960
there's a new document zero zero version

1473
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,319
from tng

1474
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:58,839
png it's all us

1475
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,520
yes you hear me right now

1476
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,400
yes

1477
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,760
we good

1478
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,880
good okay

1479
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,599
oh yeah uh okay uh thank you good day

1480
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,520
everyone

1481
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,799
uh my topic on this one is regarding the

1482
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:15,760
the distributed upf

1483
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,359
is applied to

1484
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,200
5g multicast and broadcast services

1485
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,559
and also thank you for jeff so basically

1486
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:27,039
he has already presented about

1487
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,839
the dupf so it's going to save me a lot

1488
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,000
of time on that part

1489
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,960
next slide please l3 next please yeah

1490
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,960
for this slide is about the

1491
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,200
introduction or is the description of

1492
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,160
the dupf in 5g user plan

1493
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,760
so it's uh

1494
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,400
the all the details are in the

1495
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,000
draft uh

1496
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,400
jeff and kiel and myself

1497
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,119
are composed so

1498
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,079
i'm not going to repeat i think that

1499
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,880
jeff has already give a very good uh

1500
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,440
presentation so the next one

1501
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,839
three uh the next time okay

1502
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,760
oh it's all

1503
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,200
gabo

1504
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,559
yeah

1505
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,720
but i think um maybe the format yeah

1506
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,120
just speak to the you know slide down

1507
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,399
it's fine

1508
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,640
okay yes uh let me okay so here well

1509
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,279
actually well i i need to read something

1510
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,198
here so but but okay

1511
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:30,399
so uh this picture is regarding the 5g

1512
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,600
mbs architecture and then i

1513
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,520
just put some simple brief

1514
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,359
things here without giving the full

1515
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:40,880
details

1516
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,679
i'm not sure you can see

1517
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:44,880
the

1518
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,920
some some interfaces

1519
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,600
uh it's like n6mb about the right

1520
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,839
between

1521
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,640
satoru-san we lost the sharing

1522
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,440
yes uh

1523
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,000
okay how can i enlarge

1524
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,560
oh okay oh good good thank you thank you

1525
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,759
very good

1526
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,279
okay uh

1527
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,880
it's much better right now so here um i

1528
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,000
just

1529
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,080
described briefly about the 5g mbs

1530
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,839
based on the 3gp document 23.247.

1531
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,120
here

1532
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,080
you may

1533
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,439
pay attention to three interfaces on the

1534
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:48,719
the data player

1535
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:50,719
one is the

1536
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,080
n6mb

1537
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,000
between uh it's about the right side

1538
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,480
between mbupf and the dn

1539
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,920
the other two

1540
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:58,800
uh

1541
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,239
19 mb between the upf and upf and then

1542
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,640
the other one is the n3 and b

1543
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,320
between mb upf and the g node b

1544
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,400
here for 5g mbs there are two delivery

1545
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,640
modes one is the individual the other

1546
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,120
one is the share

1547
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,800
so uh for both uh cases so when the dung

1548
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,719
link mbs packet

1549
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,679
from mb upf where uh

1550
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:30,719
n6mb the mbupf is going to replicate and

1551
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:31,840
forward

1552
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,800
and then based on the either individual

1553
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,679
of uh individual delivery or the shared

1554
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,040
delivery

1555
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,080
so according to the 23 the 3gpp document

1556
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,080
23.2

1557
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,840
from the mbupf or either on the n6 side

1558
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,640
or a 19 or n3 side

1559
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,800
either the unicast underlay

1560
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,239
transformation

1561
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:59,280
transport or multicast

1562
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,239
or

1563
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,640
underlay transport

1564
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,640
can be uh can be applied so

1565
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,800
so basically you're going to deal with

1566
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,960
either unicast or multicast this is for

1567
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,400
the underlay

1568
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,560
so so for example

1569
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,120
even for the individual

1570
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,880
in video mode

1571
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,239
you may be

1572
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,600
able to use multicast trans

1573
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,880
transmission

1574
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,960
to send from mb

1575
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,480
upf to multiple ups

1576
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,080
okay so

1577
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,880
yeah uh next one place here is just a

1578
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,280
description of 5g mbs oh three next one

1579
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,000
yeah so here's a

1580
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,360
uh there are some challenges uh so the

1581
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,880
the first one is like uh um

1582
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,679
uh

1583
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:50,560
for the

1584
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,120
for the uh 5g mbs because the new

1585
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,640
control plane and the user plan

1586
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,280
functions there are never functions

1587
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,159
introduced so it's going to post some

1588
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:01,760
additional provisioning

1589
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,920
and implementing challenges

1590
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,040
so uh like you try to really unders

1591
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,800
understitching between

1592
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,960
upf and upf and the dn here

1593
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,000
other challenges that's the third one

1594
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,400
well like the second one is like three

1595
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,400
new interfaces

1596
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,199
uh it's corresponding to three different

1597
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:24,719
segments

1598
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,520
and then uh those uh three as i have

1599
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,880
already described the three uh segments

1600
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,080
can use either the unicast underlay or

1601
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,840
multicast

1602
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,280
underlay

1603
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,520
uh this will make implementation mode

1604
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,640
diversified but also means

1605
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,280
more complicated or challenged

1606
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,760
so a next one

1607
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,000
so

1608
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,520
next slide yeah sorry about that

1609
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,760
yeah here i i use the the requirement

1610
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,000
from rfc

1611
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,320
733 is a requirement for a dmm

1612
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,560
distributed mobility management it say

1613
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,199
okay multiply the efficiency between

1614
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:10,719
non-optimal and optimal rules

1615
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,280
can you click

1616
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,800
no actually it's a animation so why i oh

1617
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,920
yeah okay

1618
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,480
so here this is like

1619
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,120
because the uh the

1620
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,320
23.247 require

1621
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,400
all multi uh all dangling multicast

1622
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,400
traffic goes through the centralized mb

1623
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,560
ups regardless of individual or shared

1624
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,679
so it's a

1625
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,080
it's kind of less efficient if the

1626
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,600
operator's 5gs is deployed in a location

1627
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,280
that is rather distant

1628
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,679
from the customer edge side

1629
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,800
um so actually well it's already

1630
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,920
lc is kind of

1631
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,719
the common uh in in operators network

1632
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,040
right now for the 5gs

1633
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,530
and then in in

1634
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:02,159
[Music]

1635
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:05,199
in the network in the field deployment

1636
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:09,199
uh in some operators um the the ups

1637
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,840
actually is already distributed close to

1638
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,520
the edge side

1639
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,280
that's why it's here i emphasize the 5gd

1640
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,880
ups

1641
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,239
so with this

1642
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,679
in consideration

1643
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:24,239
i can go to the next one

1644
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,879
next slide

1645
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,800
yeah so as i uh oh you can just click

1646
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,480
through and then to show the full

1647
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,919
contents of this slide

1648
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,239
one more yeah okay so here it's like uh

1649
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:42,320
the proposal and the considerations like

1650
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:47,120
how to use the dupf for uh 5g mbs

1651
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,920
the dupf case and then we're going to

1652
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,800
deploy the upf close to uh access

1653
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,600
network basically the genome b

1654
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,320
so in that case for the shared delivery

1655
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,960
so if you uh still memorize the

1656
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,199
architecture the brief architecture i

1657
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,159
showed

1658
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:06,159
so the mb upf

1659
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:09,120
uh is the it's like the the centralized

1660
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,120
upf and then it goes through the

1661
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,719
industry and b

1662
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:15,360
and then uh distribute and then the send

1663
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,920
traffic i'll transmit traffic transfer

1664
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,480
traffic throughout the genome b

1665
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:25,120
so here if the uh mb ups or just like a

1666
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,320
like a distributed ups is uh

1667
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,280
it's uh uh deployed close to g no b and

1668
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,000
then it's uh going to uh

1669
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,159
going to be made much simpler just like

1670
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:39,760
uh what jeff has described in case in in

1671
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,080
the proposal in the draft to benefit

1672
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,120
from the dupf deployment

1673
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,480
for the individual delivery uh here is

1674
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,840
uh it involves two ups by the regular

1675
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,360
the other one is 1 mb upf

1676
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,800
so

1677
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,159
here what i'm

1678
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:01,040
thinking or is

1679
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,280
it's like to distribute

1680
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,280
and deploy both upf closer to g no b

1681
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:11,679
um so for this case uh the an um a 19 mb

1682
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:12,880
tunnel

1683
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,159
and uh

1684
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,719
and the regular ent3 tunnel um you know

1685
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:19,120
if you uh if you look at the

1686
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,280
architecture so they'll be significantly

1687
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,800
simplified so it's just like to to

1688
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,360
to benefit also uh from the uh the

1689
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,800
uh distribute upf architecture

1690
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,679
and

1691
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:36,640
remember here as i described for all the

1692
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,640
three segments

1693
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,800
um for the n19 mb and 6mb and the n3mb

1694
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,320
those three segments

1695
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,960
either unicast or multitask under the

1696
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,480
translation can be used so here is uh if

1697
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,840
we uh

1698
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,640
deploy the uh the ups

1699
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,159
uh two out of um in a distributed mode

1700
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:01,520
uh closer to g no b they'll uh that will

1701
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,640
make the

1702
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,840
uh the kind

1703
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,679
the uh

1704
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,320
the architecture or the transparencies

1705
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,880
can uh it's much simpler

1706
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,800
uh the other one the servant the

1707
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,440
long-term consideration is now is beyond

1708
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,960
the 23.

1709
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,120
uh 247

1710
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,239
so

1711
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:23,280
the the scene here is uh

1712
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,400
it's likely to uh integrate so sort of a

1713
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,640
similar a little bit similar

1714
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:33,360
uh to the the a lg node b uh integration

1715
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,880
the genomic and

1716
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,920
uh the upf uh uh integration part but

1717
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,640
here i'm thinking is like to regular upf

1718
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,239
and bupf together as a distributed uh

1719
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:45,360
ups

1720
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,080
so uh in that case we'll make this one

1721
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,000
even more uh it's a small uh

1722
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,520
more efficient

1723
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,239
and also it's better for multicast

1724
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,880
multicast traffic forwarding

1725
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,960
it's a confirming to the rfc uh 733 the

1726
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,080
request the the requirement eight but

1727
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,920
still this is the long term part since

1728
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,760
it's going to

1729
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,400
to put the the director upf and then the

1730
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,440
upf together the distributed ups

1731
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,239
so it's a it's a long term part

1732
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,678
i can go to the next one

1733
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,800
yeah can you click through

1734
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,320
yeah i think they are oh okay probably

1735
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,960
that's okay so here is for the the next

1736
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,239
step things is try to uh uh to make the

1737
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,920
dupf shared

1738
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,360
and in the video delivery mode i try to

1739
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,120
refine more

1740
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,520
and also in epi domain the controlling

1741
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,480
signaling for underlying transport

1742
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,679
uh the the vpn part since you know

1743
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:50,400
the

1744
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,199
srv6 all this kind of things

1745
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:56,400
um how to uh how to do the signaling to

1746
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,840
consider further

1747
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,120
and another part actually i'm thinking

1748
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,159
uh

1749
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:05,120
for the for the 3gpp right now this uh

1750
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,239
there's a project in 2

1751
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:13,120
about the ups the the upf uh exposure

1752
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:13,840
uh

1753
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,840
capability uh

1754
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:16,640
to

1755
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,640
to 5g system

1756
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,560
so in this in this project there is uh

1757
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,520
there's some discussion regarding to

1758
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,080
uh to use the the trusted af to

1759
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,080
influence upf traffic

1760
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,640
so actually that one

1761
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,840
um

1762
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,320
you know when i was uh

1763
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,320
composing this draft i'm thinking okay

1764
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,000
to use uh

1765
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,480
like a controller the trust ap the trust

1766
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,480
ef can be like a controller

1767
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,880
such that uh for all the

1768
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,040
like the relay the staging and the

1769
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,760
control plan to integrate between the ip

1770
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,520
domain and the 5gs together so

1771
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,560
i was at that moment and also right now

1772
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,520
and later uh for the future to con

1773
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,320
to look at the trust af things to see

1774
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,330
how it's going to

1775
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:06,560
[Music]

1776
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,400
influence the ups

1777
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,760
things

1778
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,520
so yeah this is the next steps

1779
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,440
okay so that

1780
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,520
is my talk

1781
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,080
uh comments please

1782
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,920
okay thank you

1783
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,480
for your presentation i think um a few

1784
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,639
things i think uh yeah this is a new

1785
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:29,440
topic interesting i think one thing i

1786
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:33,199
clearly see that you know in the id that

1787
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:36,320
you are not suggesting changing the 3gb

1788
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,159
architecture or all right

1789
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:41,760
i think i like the first statement

1790
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,880
but i think

1791
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,600
we want to understand exactly you know

1792
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,159
yeah what what the changes will be and

1793
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:49,840
you know what we can do here but uh

1794
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,080
before that yeah let's see you know if

1795
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,679
anybody has any comments and questions

1796
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,840
uh who is in the queue one second

1797
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,080
any questions from

1798
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,280
the room

1799
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,880
i see hannah yeah i know please

1800
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,120
yeah yes uh as i

1801
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,880
already have it in my previous comment

1802
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,880
there is a reason why

1803
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,400
multicast utf is central

1804
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,040
it is because it's servicing multiple

1805
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,920
chain of these and the reason why

1806
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,040
it needs to

1807
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,040
service multiple genome pieces that

1808
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,320
deter

1809
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:35,040
synchronizing edtp sequence numbers

1810
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,880
to ensure that

1811
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,600
there are no

1812
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:43,000
complicated pdu

1813
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,639
okay

1814
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,960
so so there is a technical reason why

1815
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,760
it's

1816
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,280
up there in the hierarchy and not of

1817
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,400
course that at the edge

1818
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,320
uh sorry your wife's a little broken but

1819
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,120
yeah

1820
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,480
that's true

1821
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,679
you may have to

1822
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,760
speak up hannah i think even i could not

1823
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,679
follow it at least for some part

1824
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:07,520
if you don't mind quickly repeating the

1825
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,840
question please

1826
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,880
was not it was not a quest question yeah

1827
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,120
it was more of a comment that there is a

1828
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,080
technical reason why

1829
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,719
multicast upf is centralized and

1830
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,880
and the reason is that

1831
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,440
the multicast upf is servicing multiple

1832
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:31,239
gene rp's in order to synchronize

1833
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:36,040
pdcp sequence numbers

1834
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,679
yes well

1835
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:43,679
but the thing is like you know it's i

1836
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:45,440
try to uh

1837
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,799
uh how about like uh

1838
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,960
for for mb uh upf so the thing is like

1839
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,600
when the three gp set up the the control

1840
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,560
plan

1841
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,840
and then there is uh some uh criteria to

1842
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,320
select the mbupf

1843
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:06,080
yes i agree with you one amp upf uh can

1844
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,280
be used to

1845
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,679
to talk to multiple

1846
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:11,280
genobies

1847
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,080
here it's like say even if you put this

1848
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,120
one close to some distributed

1849
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:20,239
locations you still can do the similar

1850
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,199
things

1851
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:23,760
especially for for the large uh

1852
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,920
deployment for

1853
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,239
for some uh for some countries with uh

1854
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:29,679
large uh

1855
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,360
networks uh mobile or 5g networks

1856
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,639
so

1857
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:35,360
i

1858
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,400
uh to be honest i am not seeing any

1859
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,120
discrepancy here it's like

1860
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,400
say suppose you deploy the mbpf in the

1861
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,159
centralized or in the distributed

1862
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,600
location

1863
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,400
so it still can handle the multiple

1864
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,480
right so so png this is a great

1865
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,800
technical discussion let's uh you know i

1866
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,440
think uh hundreds uh i know feedback why

1867
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,440
don't you respond in the mailer we take

1868
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,560
it from

1869
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,280
yeah

1870
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,760
i think uh we'll also ask you know let's

1871
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,239
also ask others to review the document

1872
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,920
and i think um

1873
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,199
if there no

1874
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,360
if there is interest we can see what we

1875
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,199
can do so okay

1876
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:14,960
the next step is truly we want to see

1877
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,840
some discussions on on the mailer yeah

1878
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,080
but dean you know i want to i just have

1879
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,639
a general comment we have about 35 more

1880
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:24,560
minutes in the meeting and one more

1881
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,960
presentation so there is an interesting

1882
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,360
discussion why not use this time right

1883
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,520
now in order to go you know go through

1884
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,520
it

1885
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,120
no we have to repeat at least one

1886
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,560
presentation and we also have one more

1887
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,120
topic here

1888
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,120
all right uh

1889
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,560
next

1890
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,880
yeah thank you again uh tng for your

1891
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,800
presentation i think uh yeah there is

1892
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,000
interest let's let's stick to the mailer

1893
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,960
next one is yeah

1894
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,080
next topic is on next is the satellite

1895
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,040
uh communication this is a

1896
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,159
again a new proposal satellite network

1897
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:08,159
problems and solutions from l3

1898
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:09,679
perspective

1899
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,000
i was not sure what we are proposing

1900
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,199
here but uh let's hear from the authors

1901
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:16,880
uh can you hear me

1902
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:17,760
yes

1903
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,280
please

1904
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,960
it's all yours yeah

1905
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,120
okay thank you uh

1906
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,080
uh hello everyone uh my name is linhan

1907
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:30,400
and my presentation has a couple of uh

1908
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,080
drafts first draft was the problem under

1909
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,480
requirement for satellite level which

1910
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,400
was published in a

1911
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,520
111 and the second one is a

1912
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,960
semantic address uh published in 112 and

1913
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,760
this ietf we published two drafts

1914
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,239
related to the solution and one is

1915
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,880
interactive routing second one is ospf

1916
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,760
monitor node

1917
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,199
because this

1918
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:03,280
topic is quite broad and

1919
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,239
we don't see any dedicated

1920
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,639
wg can hold it so

1921
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:11,840
we tried to uh present in different uh

1922
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,800
working group to seek more commons

1923
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,400
and uh so far only uh ospf

1924
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,360
we we know we we have to go to asr but

1925
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,520
for other things we still don't know

1926
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,560
where we

1927
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,760
have the best wt riviera 6 comments from

1928
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,719
different

1929
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,239
communities

1930
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:33,600
uh second slides please

1931
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,400
so what is the objective for our work uh

1932
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,480
our work is for the uh

1933
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,840
to explore the open solution uh

1934
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,320
specifically a

1935
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,840
layer three layer

1936
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,280
for large scale lu constellation lu

1937
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,560
is a low

1938
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,280
earth orbit

1939
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,880
and

1940
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,520
any problem

1941
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,880
okay so the constellation is used for

1942
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,000
the internet access and ntn integration

1943
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,719
with 5g and bi

1944
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,360
and first this kind of network has a

1945
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,159
huge number of nodes for example just

1946
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:16,159
like the styling more than 10 000

1947
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:19,760
satellites and more than million

1948
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,840
ground stations

1949
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,440
second is that we assume the

1950
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,840
interstellar link is used

1951
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,480
right now the uh for example the

1952
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:33,839
starting first data service only uses a

1953
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,040
relay technology which doesn't have iso

1954
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,800
leak but right now they start to expand

1955
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,560
experimented

1956
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,360
with isl the satellite will be connect

1957
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,400
together and form a network

1958
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,880
and the third objective is that the

1959
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,440
satellite network has to provide global

1960
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,760
coverage it's just like a

1961
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:59,120
very local or very small distance

1962
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:03,120
and also we try to uh explore solution

1963
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:06,600
which can be used for the uh

1964
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,880
regenerative modes

1965
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,520
proposed by 3gpp

1966
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,480
in this mode means that every satellite

1967
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,400
is kind of

1968
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,040
player multiple functions

1969
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,440
from tinobi to the

1970
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,120
network node

1971
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,480
and for that kind of requirements ip is

1972
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,159
the infrastructure

1973
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:30,320
for the ntn integration

1974
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,880
it is the player like the transport

1975
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,560
network for the

1976
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,040
current 5g of 4g network

1977
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,360
so what we do we will do the basic ip

1978
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,400
technology for satellite network and so

1979
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,360
far the

1980
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,120
draft are only

1981
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,440
informational experimental

1982
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,960
we won't seek the

1983
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,280
feedback from wg

1984
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,239
and obviously this topic is quite

1985
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,080
complicated

1986
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,120
so far we only have a

1987
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,960
three draft about solution definitely

1988
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,360
it's not enough i think maybe more will

1989
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,639
come

1990
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,239
what we will not do we will not do

1991
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:09,920
anything regarding the 3gpp it's okay

1992
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,760
and uh first uh about problem that's uh

1993
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,600
the first draft we had and uh

1994
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,639
the draft may not be is a quite a long

1995
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:23,120
so if you want to see more explanation

1996
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,159
by slice we have a workshop which was

1997
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:29,360
done to the university of missouri

1998
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,880
and

1999
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,760
the

2000
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,880
slides answered most of the questions uh

2001
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,480
collected in icf and other discussions

2002
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,880
and most of the questions are not really

2003
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,280
about the technical is about why we do

2004
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,520
this kind of work

2005
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,960
and

2006
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,360
secondly that we have a little bit

2007
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,880
detailed introduction about what 3gb png

2008
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:53,920
ram

2009
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,679
uh are

2010
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,280
published for the requirement for

2011
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,199
satellite level

2012
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,760
they have a very detailed

2013
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,120
description

2014
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,440
and

2015
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,920
for those requirement the ip definitely

2016
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,840
is kind of a requirement

2017
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,159
infrastructure has to provide iot

2018
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:14,560
connectivity

2019
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,600
also we we provide some simulations for

2020
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,159
mobility links and paths

2021
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,560
from those simulation you can see how

2022
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,159
our challenge of this problem

2023
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:29,360
the next slide please

2024
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,440
and

2025
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,159
this is a second about a second draft a

2026
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:38,000
semantic select address and

2027
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,840
for this ietf we have some updates add a

2028
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,880
call and also add the 32-bit semantic

2029
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:45,840
address

2030
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,360
at this section

2031
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:50,719
and for because people may not be aware

2032
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:53,760
of this so i have a simple introduction

2033
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,800
here

2034
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,159
satellite network is kind of where all

2035
01:30:58,159 --> 01:30:59,280
its

2036
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,840
moving objective

2037
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:04,480
objects so it has multiple layers uh

2038
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,040
layer is kind of uh

2039
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,760
depends on the altitude of satellites

2040
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,320
and each layer is a interleaved grid

2041
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,199
level which means

2042
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:17,520
percent satellites uh moving in one

2043
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,199
direction another fifty percent of

2044
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:22,080
satellites moving another direction

2045
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,239
and uh by this uh uh uh organize the

2046
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:28,960
network we can easily

2047
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,920
think about to identify the network by

2048
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,320
uh different index right now we

2049
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:37,360
introduce three uh index one is the

2050
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:40,159
uh shear index which will tell which

2051
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:42,480
layer of the satellite belong to and

2052
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,040
second is obvious plan index which will

2053
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,440
tell which object it will belong to the

2054
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,080
third one is a seller index there is a

2055
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,480
tail which is a satellite in the orbit

2056
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,600
for example

2057
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:54,639
this one

2058
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,400
uh the um

2059
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,199
is the the force index is zero means the

2060
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,679
shear index is zero means all altitudes

2061
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:04,480
belong to uh uh uh

2062
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,440
zero uh shares second one is the pain is

2063
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,400
um orbit means that this orbit belongs

2064
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,679
to index of the tank of the orbit

2065
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:17,199
and the last index is uh

2066
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,520
represents the which satellite in the

2067
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,520
orbit

2068
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,480
next slide please

2069
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,120
so this is about the

2070
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,560
lattice draft which we propose the uh

2071
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,280
rotating solution for satellite

2072
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,159
and

2073
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:36,159
why we need to

2074
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:38,639
think about new solutions

2075
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:40,960
because of the currently distributed

2076
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,239
routing algorithm uh igt or bgp will

2077
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,480
face a lot of challenges

2078
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,520
and

2079
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,480
we have a constant satellite ground

2080
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,520
station link flipping and very frequent

2081
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,080
also the constant link matrix uh

2082
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,480
changing because of the

2083
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,760
link

2084
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,159
distances changing

2085
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:08,880
and also the constant unsteady link

2086
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,120
flipping uh

2087
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,920
unsteady link also

2088
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,719
defined in in the problem statement

2089
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:17,760
draft

2090
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,600
which is the links between adjacent

2091
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,120
satellite moving to different directions

2092
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,280
and also possible link interaction at

2093
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,719
the follow area

2094
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,400
which links are the

2095
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,639
links between adjacent satellites moving

2096
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,239
to the same direction

2097
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:33,840
because those

2098
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,800
satellites will cross over at the polar

2099
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,080
area

2100
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,600
so the links

2101
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,239
may also be interrupted

2102
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,320
and all about

2103
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,120
about will cause a huge ipp protocol

2104
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,120
message flooding and reduce the service

2105
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,360
time automatically

2106
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,320
next slide please

2107
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:57,920
next slide

2108
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,400
you can board you can hold your slide or

2109
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,400
yourself

2110
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,760
now you know how to float

2111
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,520
it doesn't work

2112
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,440
or maybe

2113
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,080
next slice

2114
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,599
one second

2115
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:44,800
yep

2116
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,760
no no no earlier

2117
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,679
earlier

2118
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:52,880
again

2119
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,040
again

2120
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,840
okay okay next slice

2121
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:02,560
please okay so this is reveal how the uh

2122
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,840
how the uh satellite network is uh uh

2123
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,560
moving through uh topology looks like

2124
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,760
uh we have a uh

2125
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:12,840
satellite

2126
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,239
moving at very high speed

2127
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:19,920
and the 50 percent moving to uh

2128
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,239
north to source and 50 percent moving

2129
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:24,639
from south to north

2130
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:26,159
and the

2131
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,480
link matrix between the

2132
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,360
uh iso is keep changing because of

2133
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,679
distances keep changing

2134
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:36,159
and also ground station to cell link

2135
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:39,360
will be frequently uh changing and also

2136
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:42,639
the link matrix will be changed

2137
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,040
besides the satellite moving the ground

2138
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,520
station is also moving with the earth's

2139
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,639
rotation

2140
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:49,679
so

2141
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,760
that's why the topology is every

2142
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,480
everything is moving in this technology

2143
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:57,839
next slides please

2144
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,320
so uh what is the problem when we use

2145
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:03,679
the igp for satellite network uh

2146
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:06,639
the because of link number is huge and

2147
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:09,280
for example starlink we have over one

2148
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:12,159
billion ground station to sell i loop

2149
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:13,199
and

2150
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:14,880
every satellite a ground station to

2151
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,360
satellite link will be flipping

2152
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,280
in about five to ten minutes that

2153
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,679
depends on altitude

2154
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:24,080
if we use a traditional igp this will

2155
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,480
cause huge number of lsa flooding before

2156
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:27,600
network

2157
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,760
so there's a simple mass

2158
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,840
which can

2159
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,159
roughly estimate that

2160
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:36,960
every second we will have more than 3000

2161
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,040
times times link flipping

2162
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,360
definitely this will dramatically reduce

2163
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,199
the service time

2164
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:45,360
here we have the service time definition

2165
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,520
is a

2166
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,800
reduce

2167
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,679
remove the reconvergence time then the

2168
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:54,800
remainder time will be service time it's

2169
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,159
estimated

2170
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:59,280
that less than 20 percent for a network

2171
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,400
next slice please

2172
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,199
so what is a

2173
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,119
solution was best solution for central

2174
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:09,040
network for uh ip connectivity

2175
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,880
definitely we have to think about what

2176
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,040
is the special characteristics for the

2177
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,880
center network

2178
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,639
and the satellite network is a carrier

2179
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:19,119
network for internet access and antenna

2180
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,839
integration

2181
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,360
if i may comment all right you may want

2182
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,360
to relate you know how this work would

2183
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:30,800
be relevant in dmm to dm working group

2184
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,600
okay so uh actually you

2185
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,600
yeah another five minutes if we can wrap

2186
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,119
it up because i want to make sure john

2187
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,040
has his time yeah

2188
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,840
okay so basically when i presently in

2189
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,119
other groups people think the dmm

2190
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:48,080
may be more epic and some people even

2191
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,040
ask me why the pmm cannot be used for

2192
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,679
free so that's why i come here to seek

2193
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,320
more comments yeah so i i quickly go

2194
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,000
through then the

2195
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,840
seller network is a transport network

2196
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:04,719
and and also the constellation is uh uh

2197
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:07,040
where all it even it is extremely

2198
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:10,080
thailand it's a multiplayer and a great

2199
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,639
network even interleaved

2200
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:13,520
and

2201
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,400
limited number of errors i see

2202
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,119
and also the address as i said is that

2203
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:22,960
can be self explained

2204
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,719
third point is that satellite position

2205
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,360
is predictable with the time

2206
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,119
because we know the

2207
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:32,880
element of the elements so

2208
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,960
all satellite adjacency and the link

2209
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,960
metrics can be estimated

2210
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,920
next slide please

2211
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:42,840
so we have

2212
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:46,560
a think about the some uh solution

2213
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,760
principles

2214
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,000
first is that we have to

2215
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,159
maximize the usage of computation

2216
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,320
because i said the satellite is the

2217
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,199
position is critical so we don't need to

2218
01:38:57,199 --> 01:39:00,960
use a protocol to dynamically uh

2219
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,560
populate those

2220
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,920
informations

2221
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,400
such as the network topology link matrix

2222
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,639
and the

2223
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:11,119
ground station to satellite link

2224
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,520
so we can borrow the but we can borrow a

2225
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,360
current igp for satellite network

2226
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,920
topology and state detection uh for

2227
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,880
example we we have this draft which will

2228
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,320
isolate extremely unstable link

2229
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,800
and also probably more draft will come

2230
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,800
out for the past

2231
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,239
and we will utilize the special

2232
01:39:31,239 --> 01:39:33,600
characteristics for satellite for

2233
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,239
example the address part

2234
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:38,560
and also we want to minimize the rotting

2235
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,960
overhead because right now with all

2236
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:41,840
those

2237
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,840
information

2238
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,880
routine

2239
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,119
is a steel challenge because

2240
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:49,920
as i said the regular routing the

2241
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,400
flooding issue if we use the soft

2242
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,639
rotting and second routine the overhead

2243
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:55,920
is cooking

2244
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,840
so for this new draft we we we propose a

2245
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,000
new interactive routine

2246
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,199
and

2247
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,679
we use a instruction list instead of

2248
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:06,960
segments

2249
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,000
and the segment address

2250
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,840
uses semantic address compressor

2251
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,080
interaction thus will be

2252
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:18,320
much less overhead next slide please

2253
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,719
so this is how instruction interactive

2254
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:24,960
routing works it's very simple

2255
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,639
for example if we

2256
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:29,040
know the path from here to here

2257
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,360
then cross some

2258
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,480
satellites

2259
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:35,280
then we can easily convert the

2260
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,719
path to these

2261
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,600
whole past to be some segments

2262
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,840
then the from the segments we can

2263
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,400
convert to be our instruction list

2264
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,119
the instruction list is composed of the

2265
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:48,719
function and

2266
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:51,440
arguments the functions that will tear

2267
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:55,360
fall into which direction and until

2268
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,119
which satellite

2269
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:59,760
for example this incremental satellite

2270
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,920
id means that the incremental direction

2271
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,920
until reached a satellite id equal to

2272
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,719
x17

2273
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,639
and the secondary instruction is that

2274
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:10,560
the forward to increment the direction

2275
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,960
of the orbital plane

2276
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,400
index until the orbit uh plane

2277
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:19,280
equal to c and third one is uh

2278
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,679
incremental direction forwarding

2279
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:23,360
to a set uh

2280
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,239
of satellite id and until cell id equal

2281
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:29,920
to four last one is the end of the

2282
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,360
folding and the

2283
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,760
the package to the ground station by the

2284
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,000
interface id

2285
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,960
next slides please

2286
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:44,159
yeah this is how the

2287
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:47,040
user plan looks like if we uh

2288
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,000
uh

2289
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,880
use the uh tonerless mode

2290
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,320
which means the

2291
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,560
instruction can be directly embedded

2292
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,679
into the

2293
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:56,960
some

2294
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,960
extension right now we propose to use

2295
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,400
the rocking header

2296
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,360
and

2297
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,000
then the packet will be

2298
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,080
formed at the ground station and then

2299
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,480
send to another ground station and for

2300
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:11,280
3g pp point view then of course we can

2301
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:15,600
insert the gtpu tunnel here then

2302
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,280
everything is the same just the

2303
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,600
following mechanism is different because

2304
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,840
we don't even need to look at the source

2305
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,320
and escalation address in the

2306
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,199
header

2307
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:28,839
next slides please

2308
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,560
so a summary of the interactive routing

2309
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,199
it fits into the special requirements of

2310
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:37,520
satellite level and reduce the

2311
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,840
distributed protocol messenger

2312
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:43,119
which is a big o hat for for the

2313
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:44,560
solution

2314
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,280
and it will eliminate the population of

2315
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,760
huge number of internet prefix and the

2316
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,080
segment routing sid

2317
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,440
and also

2318
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,080
we can see that for the forwarding it's

2319
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,480
simpler because we it's a satellite it's

2320
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,360
a different not like a regular router so

2321
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,760
we can reduce the tcam usage because the

2322
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:07,040
tea time is still pretty expensive uh in

2323
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,880
satellite because satellite environment

2324
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,400
is different

2325
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:13,360
and by interactive routing it will has

2326
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,280
much less

2327
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,920
size overhead and for example overhead

2328
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,119
will be number of segments plus one

2329
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,400
times two

2330
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:26,080
octaves normally and

2331
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:29,360
for regular satellites network if iso is

2332
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,520
not broken then very limited number of

2333
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,440
segments

2334
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:36,000
lastly that we can reduce the

2335
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,239
iso link bandwidth consumption for

2336
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:40,800
control purpose because iso link is

2337
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,280
still very expensive

2338
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:45,600
maximum about 10 gig so

2339
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,960
so far so

2340
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,280
the reduced link consumption is still

2341
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,840
very valuable

2342
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:54,639
custom that's it

2343
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,880
thank you thank you lynn uh i'm not

2344
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,719
going to take any questions at this time

2345
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:00,960
but i think

2346
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,600
lynn if you think the working group

2347
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,760
can help on you know

2348
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:07,920
yeah i just want to see some comments

2349
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:11,199
from the dmm because the people uh

2350
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:14,480
trying to change them asked me to come

2351
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,199
ask the dmn if a german can solve the

2352
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:20,000
problem if not cannot solve then this

2353
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,280
definitely is a work we can do yeah yeah

2354
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,159
let's let's let's discuss on the mailer

2355
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:27,440
let's see you know

2356
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,440
how it relates to mobility and what we

2357
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,600
can do here and if it's in the chat

2358
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,520
so with that thank you so much

2359
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,239
and next topic is john uh can we go back

2360
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:41,199
to your quick quickly an update yeah

2361
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:43,920
thanks

2362
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,760
again this is an update on the working

2363
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,280
group document john this time we can

2364
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,920
hear you please go ahead okay great

2365
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,480
okay next slide please

2366
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,679
so uh

2367
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:55,840
the the changes in this i'll try to be

2368
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,440
as brief as possible in the interest of

2369
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:00,239
time um thanks for giving me this

2370
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:03,440
opportunity to present again so the

2371
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,679
the new draft i mean updates from

2372
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:07,920
version two to three

2373
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,560
is that uh the comment that the draft

2374
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,920
text is not focused is being addressed

2375
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,320
and also

2376
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,400
add changes to

2377
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,000
reference

2378
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,159
uh the drafts on slices for example in

2379
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:23,199
teas

2380
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:24,800
and then a few other miscellaneous

2381
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:25,920
changes

2382
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,600
so if i could go to the next slide

2383
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,600
please

2384
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,280
so the changes uh to

2385
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,960
focus this uh

2386
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,000
draft

2387
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,960
is

2388
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,199
mostly in the introduction but there are

2389
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:41,760
a few miscellaneous changes also

2390
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:42,560
so

2391
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,880
the key changes i'm just putting a few

2392
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,719
snippets here to give you

2393
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:51,840
um a feed a look into what has been done

2394
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:55,440
basically the slice aspects as it

2395
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,760
relates to 3gbp is highlighted here so

2396
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,560
basically that the slice in 3gpp is a

2397
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,600
logical chunk of 3gpp resources

2398
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,040
and then in volatilized form we add you

2399
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,639
know why we need

2400
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,600
or what is being done in this draft the

2401
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:14,080
fact that 3gbp standards do not address

2402
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,320
the ip transport network capabilities or

2403
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,360
slices

2404
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:20,239
and so on you know you can read through

2405
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:21,199
those

2406
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:22,480
items

2407
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,440
and

2408
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,199
also

2409
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:28,719
you know what what we do in terms of the

2410
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:30,400
network interfaces

2411
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,520
and the slicing in

2412
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,280
in the transport network and how it is

2413
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,320
mapped

2414
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:39,600
so those changes are made very crisp and

2415
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,560
we remove all the other

2416
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,400
decks that

2417
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,000
you know is related to routing and

2418
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,280
everything else

2419
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:50,639
so it's very focused on slicing 3gpp and

2420
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:51,840
what

2421
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,440
what is being done

2422
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,360
to facilitate that in the transport

2423
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,159
network so that's the major change if we

2424
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:01,440
go to the next slide

2425
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,440
okay the actions that are remaining

2426
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:08,080
that came up in previously were to share

2427
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,520
this with other working groups that's

2428
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,280
something we've got to do

2429
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,480
and then

2430
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,480
i think we would like to get more

2431
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,480
detailed reviews within the

2432
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,480
this working group

2433
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:21,199
and i think at this at that point we

2434
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:24,080
should be ready to move forward

2435
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:27,280
okay and address everything else

2436
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,159
okay i think that's all

2437
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,760
sorry

2438
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,199
yeah thank you thank you john for your

2439
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:36,239
presentation so from the author's point

2440
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:38,639
of view you think the document is in a

2441
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:40,719
good shape you know

2442
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:42,800
ignoring the review part

2443
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,800
from that from the text point of view

2444
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,960
and from all the open issues that have

2445
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,040
come up so far but of course i have not

2446
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,560
seeing many discussions but at least

2447
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,679
from your point of view this is on track

2448
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:55,840
yes i think we've addressed uh

2449
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,679
everything that's been coming up and has

2450
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,040
come up and

2451
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,880
focused it also yeah

2452
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,360
okay so but we want some reviews some

2453
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,199
serious reviews john i think that is the

2454
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:07,440
problem right i think uh the next steps

2455
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,559
probably we should focus on that

2456
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,920
thanks yes

2457
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,639
yeah

2458
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:17,199
thanks again and one second is was there

2459
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,360
any other

2460
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,679
just

2461
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,719
yeah i think we can probably ask

2462
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:26,480
murakami-san to

2463
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:28,159
present it again

2464
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:30,400
earlier you did the presentation but

2465
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,040
nobody in the room was able to hear can

2466
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,119
we try this time let's see if it works

2467
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:37,280

2468
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:40,080
okay can you hear me

2469
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,400
uh we can hear you i want the room

2470
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,239
somebody in the room to confirm whether

2471
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:47,839
murakami-san is coming out okay now

2472
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,719

okay thank you so uh

2475
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,560
i'm gonna make you a brief update about

2476
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,159
your mobile user friend message

2477
01:48:58,159 --> 01:49:02,400
including so please go to the next slide

2478
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,960
so here is a change from here there also

2479
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,840
button to the one button so we define uh

2480
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,960
admob message uh totality a sequence

2481
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:14,800
number for gtpu message and also

2482
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,000
added

2483
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,639
flavor consideration sections

2484
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:21,920
uh next week

2485
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,040
this is a change from zero one to zero

2486
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,960
two buttons so

2487
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,679
instead of here uh item draft uh we

2488
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:34,280
report uh rfc 8754

2489
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:37,520
uh next speed

2490
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,320
so this is a change from territory and

2491
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:43,280
category button we added security

2492
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:46,159
constellation sections

2493
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:48,960
please next

2494
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:50,560
yeah so

2495
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:53,480
this is a change from here 03 to 04 and

2496
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:57,280
0.205 latest version so we just fixed

2497
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:01,520
here some title in the graph

2498
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:05,280
so as a next step we are thinking that

2499
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,679
the document has been already very

2500
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:11,199
stable so we would like to make here a

2501
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:14,719
wg adaptation call

2502
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:18,560
yeah

2503
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:20,239
see

2504
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:21,840
uh

2505
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,760
yeah thank you

2506
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,320
kamisan any any questions

2507
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,280
from anybody in the room

2508
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:33,679
any questions from the remote

2509
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:36,679
participants

2510
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:42,080
questions comments

2511
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,880
all right thank you murakami-san i think

2512
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,320
uh what are the next steps

2513
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,880
i think adoption i think we need uh i

2514
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,599
think let's paul let's uh take this to

2515
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:55,599
the mailer

2516
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:58,400
and see what the folks you know just

2517
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,920
want some more discussions and we can

2518
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,520
absolutely initiate a working group

2519
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:03,440
adoption call in the next before the

2520
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:06,320
next eight year yeah but if you can uh

2521
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,320
if authors can trigger some discussions

2522
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,159
and make sure everybody something people

2523
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:12,080
read this document i think that will be

2524
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,400
great

2525
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,199
