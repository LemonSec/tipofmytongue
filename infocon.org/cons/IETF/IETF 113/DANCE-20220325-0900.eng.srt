21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
west coast folk regardless of what the

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,000

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
yeah i'm a happy cookie this time

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
all right well numbers are getting

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,158
fairly stable

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,400
it looks like you have

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
there

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,159
like

33
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,040
actual humans hello people

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,660
hello people in real life

35
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,738
[Music]

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,680
so i do have to show off my my super

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,479
spiffy dane mug

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
that won't help unless i have my camera

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
yes

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,920
see that's nice nice and shiny

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,000
yeah we see the mirror image version but

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
uh

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
i didn't i didn't realize

44
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,920
that that meat echo didn't flip the

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,680
image

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
well

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,360
so my uh my camera is weird because it's

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,200
actually upside down and then i video

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,120
process it to turn it right side up in

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,959
order to keep the boom for the camera

51
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,879
out of the way of my vision i'm i'm very

52
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,480
strange like that

53
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
you know only geeks could do crazy stuff

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
like that so

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
how many meetings have you joined this

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
how many meetings have you joined this

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,040
week with the upside down image though

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,239
just one just just the one so

59
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,840
i don't even remember what that one was

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
but

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
um

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
let's go ahead and get started it looks

63
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,000
like numbers are getting fairly stable

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,080
there's nobody standing at the back of

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
the room this probably won't be a

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,040
two-hour meeting so we have plenty of

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,400
time but

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
so welcome to the dane authentication

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,599
for network clients everywhere dance

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,959
we need music uh a meeting um so your

71
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,760
chairs today are west hartiger paul has

72
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,680
taken over as the

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,080
are you the a.d paul for the for the

74
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,840
group

75
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,440
now uh yes i am

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,519
okay so paul's taking over as the aed

77
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,319
newly indoctrinated into the aesg and

78
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,560
i'm really happy that joey is uh offered

79
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
to help us as my co-chair for dance

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
thank you joey

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,519
uh the goal of this group is to shut

82
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,680
down before i can no longer find icons

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,440
to put on the titles page of all of our

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,159
meetings so this is the latest one

85
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,519
the good news is the internet needs

86
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,799
keeps creating new stuff so that

87
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
probably isn't a problem

88
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
uh the note will i'm sure all of you

89
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,319
have read and processed the note well um

90
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,840
the essential

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
notes are be aware of what you're saying

92
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,360
at a microphone or else you know lawyers

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
get involved and nobody wants that

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
there's a bunch of bcps that talk about

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,159
it

96
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,239
the iutf has a code of conduct that we

97
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,760
all live by which includes treating

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,560
people with respect speaking slowly and

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,720
limiting the use of slang and

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,799
terms that people don't understand

101
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,040
dispute ideas by reasoned argument not

102
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,478
by

103
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,238
violent disagreement

104
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,160
and use best engineering judgment

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
finding the best solution for the whole

106
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
of the internet is the goal of the ietf

107
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
and then contributing to ongoing work

108
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,639
within the etf

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
this is the working group information

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,479
for dance we have a data tracker of

111
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,160
course we have a purpose

112
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
the mailing list is dance.etf.org i

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,080
assume everybody is probably on it but

114
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,520
if you're not there is the url to join

115
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,120
we now have

116
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,759
three active drafts to consider

117
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,759
two of which are adopted and the other

118
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,520
one is not as we'll talk about in a

119
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,650
minute

120
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,160
[Music]

121
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
this session is being recorded we will

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
do the queue management using the meat

123
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,039
echo online site tool so

124
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680
if you are in the room please do use the

125
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
the mini client or

126
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,240
um i think that there's supposed to be a

127
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,720
scannable url in the room i actually

128
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
don't know i hope you guys do if you're

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,410
in the room

130
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,840
[Music]

131
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,080
uh the agenda today as i said you know

132
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
this and this probably will not take two

133
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,759
hours unless we dive into a whole lot of

134
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,479
discussion uh we'll take 10 minutes for

135
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
sharing related stuff

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,639
we already have this is meeting number

137
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,520
two

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,960
we had two buffs and then this is

139
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,039
meeting number two and we already have

140
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,440
an implementation so i'm super happy to

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,280
hear that that the hackathon actually

142
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
had

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
an implementation of dance-related stuff

144
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,360
so we'll get a presentation from them

145
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,039
look what it did to the font that's fun

146
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,560
the architecture document we'll talk

147
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
about a little bit and the solutions to

148
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,400
solutions documents of course we will

149
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,800
talk about uh and then we'll have a

150
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,919
little bit of time at the end for open

151
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,280
mic if people want to talk to things

152
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,319
remember one of the things we agreed to

153
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,280
er in the in framing the charter was

154
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,440
these were sort of the target documents

155
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,319
to start with there are some other

156
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,080
potential uses of of dance technology

157
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
that we were deliberately putting off

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,479
until these sort of got out the door

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,240
so we're happy to talk about those but

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,160
they're not within scope until we get

161
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,240
essentially these documents dunish

162
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,400
so we did have a call for adoptions i

163
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,759
started it on february 28th uh issued it

164
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,240
for three weeks which ended the last

165
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
week

166
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
the authors have recently published

167
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,319
updates to those documents so they are

168
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,520
now draft ietf instead of draft

169
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
hue and

170
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,479
the good news is that there seem to be

171
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,800
very good support for all of them

172
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
so those are now official working group

173
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,919
documents thank you for everybody that

174
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,360
helped

175
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,199
respond with your willingness to

176
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,479
participate and help with those

177
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,960
documents

178
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,520
i will say that the mailing list has

179
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,560
been generally quiet if you look at the

180
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
activity level on the mailing list there

181
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,680
is generally been very low volume of of

182
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,560
notes

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,400
so you know that brings me a little bit

184
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
of concern you know we do want things to

185
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,319
continue and i realize we're early on

186
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,840
and the documents are made not at a

187
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,759
point where we're ready to discuss the

188
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,280
minutiae of them

189
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
i hope we're getting to that point but

190
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,639
if you look at the message chart on the

191
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,400
right-hand side you'll see that there's

192
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
not been a whole lot of messages most of

193
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
the ones in february were responding to

194
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
me saying yes i agree to help with the

195
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
documents

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
so you know our thoughts on well how can

197
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,800
we increase discussion on the mailing

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
list and get more work done would be you

199
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
know please have more discussion on the

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,919
mailing list about the documents

201
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,240
remember that providing early review and

202
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,599
feedback is a good thing for the

203
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,960
documents so that we don't wait for all

204
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,560
the discussion to happen during last

205
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,919
call

206
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,599
and then of course discussing you know

207
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,199
use cases and things like that is always

208
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,680
a good thing to do too so

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,800
i am if anybody wants to speak to why

210
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,080
there's not been a huge amount of

211
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,879
discussion i'm i'm certainly willing to

212
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,960
listen to arguments and and uh things

213
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,199
but in the meantime

214
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,879
we'd like to see that pipe up so

215
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,639
and then back to the agenda so

216
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
i think we're up to hackathon

217
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,960
implementation results

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,199
um

219
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,199
i'm not quite sure of the couple of

220
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,120
people who was going to present who is

221
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,840
that this morning

222
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,958
someone walk into the mic or taking

223
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,799
notes

224
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,559
okay

225
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,559
oh yes and tim is taking notes thank you

226
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,360
tim for being willing to take notes

227
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,800
uh and let me get your slides

228
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,920
up are you doing it

229
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
all right thank you

230
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
um

231
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,480
so hello everyone uh gay bartomina from

232
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,080
ethnic i will present you briefly

233
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,880
the

234
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,000
uh implementation results that we've

235
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,680
uh done during the academ and also uh

236
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
the use case that we have using laura

237
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,399
one in iot

238
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,959
uh next type please

239
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,240
so uh

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
as you already know probably

241
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
we've worked on the uh two documents

242
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,519
that are here so the first one being

243
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,560
the

244
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,440
then

245
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
oh well the intent authentication and

246
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,399
the second one being the tls extension

247
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
to send the client id

248
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,240
to user server next type please

249
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,720
so

250
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,440
for the first draft we based on our

251
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
implementation on an existing uh dane

252
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
library

253
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
by schumann so

254
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,320
we didn't re-implement the whole day in

255
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
validation

256
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,120
what we did though

257
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,320
was

258
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,760
creating a

259
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,120
testing environment

260
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,839
to

261
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,760
emulate the

262
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,079
our use case with a basic client and

263
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,959
server doing mutual tls authentication

264
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
and we implemented the extension the tls

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,959
extension for both that's 1.2 and 1.3

266
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,120
i'll get back to that later

267
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,959
um also

268
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,880
in case of the

269
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,040
claim id being not sent in the extension

270
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,920
uh we fall back on using the

271
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
subject alternative name from the

272
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,640
certificate

273
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,079
but we still require uh the uh

274
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,959
tds extension to be present uh just like

275
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,519
there is no no extension uh data

276
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,959
also uh we have support for uh

277
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,160
authorization rules so that we can

278
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,360
process the client id and

279
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,320
according to whatever rules or you want

280
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,519
well accept the connection or reject it

281
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,399
the

282
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,160
one we did like the most basic one we

283
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,480
and the one that

284
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,760
was sufficient for us was just

285
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,959
accepting all client id uh on a

286
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,720
well on a given domain so our authenti

287
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,279
being like sub domain of a given domain

288
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,600
list we accept them and we reject

289
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
everything else

290
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,839
next type please

291
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,079
thank you

292
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,640
so for the tls

293
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,680
extension implementation we base our

294
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,440
work on the golang tls library and we

295
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,279
extended that so

296
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,320
i just want to to

297
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
mention here

298
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,240
that i was a bit confused uh on the

299
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,839
implementation because

300
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,079
on tds 1.2 well i don't know if it is a

301
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,160
misunderstanding on my side or or not

302
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,160
but on cs1 2 it seems that the client id

303
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
where the client is actually sending the

304
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,040
extension first and then the server is

305
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
responding because it's using like

306
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,360
client hello and server low

307
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,920
but uh

308
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,480
ts1213 is using message uh certificate

309
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,440
request message and certificate message

310
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,240
so it is the server starting the

311
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,360
well send

312
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
sending the extension first and then the

313
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,440
client and this causes issues uh because

314
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,480
uh at the clientele part we still don't

315
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
have like this uh

316
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,200
version like a negotiation so we we

317
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
don't know whether or not to to to use

318
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,360
ts12013

319
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,839
uh on the for the server side so if

320
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,720
someone like want to clarify that uh now

321
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,399
right it's honest um normally you should

322
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,920
be using uh this extension in the in the

323
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,360
same way in 1.2 and 1.3 when it comes to

324
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,200
the use of client and server hello so

325
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,720
there should be no difference uh

326
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,800
whatsoever

327
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,120
so you're you're saying that we should

328
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,000
uh always use clientele in serverless

329
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,560
and not the certificate uh request and

330
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,320
certificate message

331
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,160
unless you have a very good reason to do

332
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
so

333
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
according to the draft it's just that

334
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,600
incorrect in cs103 we're using like uh

335
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
certificate uh request and certificate

336
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,360
message and that this has the advantage

337
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,480
to like

338
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,000
not uh

339
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,320
send the client id and clear text

340
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,399
that's a that's a

341
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,639
good question to look into it yeah let

342
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,639
me have a look at that

343
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,800
uh schumann you want to speak

344
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,319
uh sure can you hear me okay

345
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,199
yep yes we can hear you fine

346
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,079
yeah so uh that is a good point so

347
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,720
the reason is uh yeah normally they

348
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,800
should be the same uh the reason they're

349
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
slightly different is because

350
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,360
of the need to

351
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
encrypt the client extension because

352
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
there are privacy concerns

353
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,160
and there's no way to do that in tls 1.2

354
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
because it has to be sent in

355
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,839
the client hello in in tls 1.3

356
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,440
you can send the

357
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,199
extension as part of the certificate

358
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,560
request message but you're right that

359
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,079
comes after

360
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,880
the certificate has been uh

361
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,920
prompted by the server side

362
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,480
in the certificate request

363
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
so yeah the order is a little bit

364
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
different but i don't think there's a

365
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,480
way

366
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,639
to do that with tls 1.2 right now the

367
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,000
draft says

368
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,079
there's no way to implement

369
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,440
privacy of the extension with tls 1.2 so

370
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,560
i think there were some folks

371
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,880
recommending that you know this may be a

372
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,199
new uh application or a greenfield

373
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,120
application and maybe we should only

374
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,360
support tls 1.3

375
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,959
but in the end i think we decided that

376
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,399
there may be

377
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,399
a

378
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,040
kind of a deployed field of clients that

379
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,519
use tls 1.2 and we would have to

380
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,440
support 1.2

381
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,839
as well

382
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,079
that is honest again um

383
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,000
but it could still be useful then to

384
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
send uh use the fluxes then flex

385
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,079
extension in in the client hello of

386
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,560
tls1.3 to indicate uh the support

387
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
um of this specific extension so that

388
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,480
when the server sends this later on in

389
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
exchange the client is not suddenly

390
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
surprised and see stuff that it's not

391
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,160
supposed to

392
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,920
sure yeah that's fair it could send an

393
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,959
empty uh extension in in the client

394
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,600
hello uh just to signal that it plans to

395
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,120
use it uh

396
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,959
sure i mean if the support for doing

397
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,119
that uh we could enhance the draft

398
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,680
okay thank you

399
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,759
um

400
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,560
so yeah that's uh all i needed to do

401
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,959
here to decide in this slide so yeah

402
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,040
thank you we can move on to the next one

403
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,120
um so

404
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,399
a bit of uh context i know the this is

405
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,360
what this was kind of what i had to say

406
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,880
about the implementation i would just

407
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,399
now speak about the

408
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,360
uh

409
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,440
use case that we have

410
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,639
so uh

411
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,120
next slide please and i think you can go

412
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
to the next one

413
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
right now okay

414
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,279
so

415
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,199
in the context of

416
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,399
lower one

417
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,160
we have like devices that are provided

418
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,120
by manufacturer and

419
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,240
to to have like the security between the

420
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,560
device and the application server

421
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
uh we're using pressured key so the

422
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,040
manufacturer

423
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,079
inject a key in the device and then

424
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:42,959
uh

425
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,920
share it with whatever well

426
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,880
actor that is involved uh next slide

427
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,480
please

428
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,839
so this sharing key sharing can be done

429
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,240
in different ways uh

430
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,120
either by using nfc the device is

431
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,519
compatible or just printing back on the

432
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,839
back of the device or send by may

433
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,199
whatever

434
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,079
next slide please

435
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,919
um so

436
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,079
during the device onboarding um

437
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,959
the

438
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,439
device uh so first sorry uh the network

439
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,520
is divided into parts like the radio

440
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,000
frequency space and the iep space

441
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,559
uh and when the device uh want to join a

442
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,120
network uh so it will send a join

443
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,960
request and that will be uh intercepted

444
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,679
by the network servers so the

445
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,760
little cloud uh

446
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,679
on the

447
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,120
uh on the picture

448
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,080
uh

449
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,960
so the network server will then resolve

450
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,840
the address of the join server so we're

451
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,960
using like

452
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,000
uh service discovery to to

453
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,960
know the join server uh associated with

454
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,480
a a device and the joint server will

455
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,360
uh

456
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,640
well say if yes or no the device is

457
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,760
allowed to to join the network and then

458
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
using the pre-shared key

459
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,960
uh we uh

460
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
we will establish uh encrypted uh

461
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,679
session between the device and the

462
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,360
application server

463
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,080
so

464
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,799
on our use case uh we will not be

465
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,960
focusing on the radio frequency space

466
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
and we'll see that in a moment but just

467
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,080
on the ib space next slide please

468
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,039
so yeah

469
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,200
uh the

470
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,000
if you if you want if we wanted like to

471
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
achieve uh

472
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,520
end-to-end security so

473
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,679
including the radio frequency space uh

474
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,280
using like uh asymmetric key or

475
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,520
certificate architecture we would not be

476
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,080
able to do that due to the very uh

477
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,559
constrained network uh

478
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,240
that we are having on the radio

479
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
frequency space

480
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,320
uh

481
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
as of right now uh a compressed

482
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,440
certificate will be like

483
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,120
146 bytes and

484
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,039
the size of the packets the maximum size

485
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
of packet is like

486
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,880
52 bytes um

487
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,559
yes

488
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,360
um

489
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,760
there's a common misconception but when

490
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,000
people refer to some radio technology is

491
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,960
that they

492
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,160
look at the mdu at the specific layer uh

493
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,440
and then say it's x bytes and then if

494
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
you the perception is if you want to

495
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,600
send something larger it's not possible

496
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,280
of course it's possible uh because it

497
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,120
just used fragmentation

498
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,000
um

499
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,320
sure this is a fair point uh

500
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,240
in number one we have a very very uh

501
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,120
slow emission rate so it's like one

502
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,160
message in a few seconds or minutes so

503
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,480
if we were to use fragmentation here it

504
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,640
will just take a very long time so

505
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,200
that's why we rather not want to do

506
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,160
fragmentation here

507
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,640
next slide please

508
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,760
so uh because of the constraint uh

509
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,000
or on the radio frequency space we'll

510
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
just like be focusing on the ip space

511
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,840
right now and

512
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,159
uh maybe if we have in the future or a

513
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,640
better way to encode certificate or not

514
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,720
or just public keys or on very

515
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,039
constrained

516
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,320
well packet size will uh do end-to-end

517
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,919
encryption from the device to the

518
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,159
application server using public key

519
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,640
right now we'll stick to uh pre-shot key

520
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,120
and only focus on the uh

521
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,480
ip space for mutual authentication here

522
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,480
so uh the ib space is a

523
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
we have like different uh kind of

524
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,559
servers so i speak about the networks

525
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,000
that are joined server application

526
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,240
server those are servers that uh can be

527
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,120
managed

528
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,600
by different stakeholders so

529
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
at some point we want to add some trust

530
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,120
in that and we're doing that using

531
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
mutual authentication and a

532
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
private pki

533
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,639
uh next slide

534
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,280
so the issue that we have like with a

535
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,120
common like uh

536
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,400
pka i like the web pair is that

537
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,520
we don't have like us to see a bundle

538
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,559
available in all uh

539
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,280
for the server to to use directly and

540
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,400
even if we had that available well

541
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,720
using uh as a

542
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,200
certificate that is like signed by a

543
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,159
common ca have some cost and even the

544
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,240
the free solution like let's encrypt

545
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,320
have some uh issue because we have like

546
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,159
constraint on the name that uh is not

547
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
allowed by let's entry basically we want

548
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
to do names with like i don't know

549
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,440
16 or 20 labels then let's encrypt

550
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,679
doesn't allow that

551
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,679
so we resulted in the pki

552
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,840
so but this means that we have like to

553
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,640
distribute the root certificate to every

554
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,440
entities and that is friction next slide

555
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,679
please

556
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,080
so this is like our

557
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,760
architecture or

558
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
right now like we have like a root ca

559
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,080
that is distributed intermediate c that

560
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,200
are assigning

561
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,240
a

562
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,120
certificate for each entity then and on

563
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,760
the bottom of the slide you have like

564
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,050
the

565
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,919
[Music]

566
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,559
dns configuration because as i said

567
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,440
we're using uh service discovery based

568
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,960
on the device so on the uh joining us uh

569
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,480
zone you have like

570
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,400
one record per uh device uh that is

571
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
either pointing to directly at the

572
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
address of the joint server or

573
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
a cname to the address of the joint

574
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,679
server

575
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,720
and the net ids is a similar zone for

576
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,880
network server so

577
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,080
this was just

578
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,480
mentioned uh because i wanted to

579
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,400
highlight the fact that we already have

580
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,440
the need

581
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,360
for a dns uh

582
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,280
well zone having

583
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,159
one and try per device and

584
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,600
network server

585
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,719
uh next time please

586
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,080
so uh because we have already

587
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,000
uh one

588
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,799
entrepreneur uh device and network

589
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,919
server we

590
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
it doesn't really have a lot of friction

591
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,679
to add a second one for the tlsa record

592
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,480
so

593
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,240
this is uh

594
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,400
i think it's important because it

595
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,480
doesn't have any more friction like if

596
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,120
we didn't have this zone it would mean

597
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,600
that we had to manage the zone

598
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,159
but we're already managing it so that

599
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,000
doesn't really matter

600
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,919
so now with

601
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,520
uh dane

602
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,000
we're just like uh

603
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,320
[Music]

604
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,279
doing the ultimate mutual authentication

605
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,919
so the network server will

606
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,120
send the

607
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,520
client id or the

608
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,360
dane client id

609
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,760
using the tls extension

610
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,799
and we have like the tlsa record on the

611
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,600
net

612
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,960
network server zone and on the same

613
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
the other side we have like the joint

614
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,880
server having a telescope recall on the

615
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,559
joint service area

616
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,080
and we are basing on trust that every uh

617
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,559
record all right this was my last night

618
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,799
anyway so

619
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,880
every uh

620
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,400
record is into the same zone so uh if we

621
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,880
trust every record in this zone we will

622
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,279
uh keep like the trust that we needed at

623
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,120
the first um

624
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,480
so yeah

625
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,360
that that's it

626
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,559
questions or comments

627
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,559
whatever

628
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,080
the dls protocol does it run between the

629
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
network server and the join server or

630
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,240
between whom or between the network

631
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,400
server and the application server

632
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,039
uh it is between the network server and

633
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,080
the join server okay um

634
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,000
well right now the implementation that

635
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,360
we use is using a single uh

636
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
server for both the join server and the

637
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,559
application server but ultimately it is

638
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,640
really between the join server and the

639
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,919
network server

640
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,520
we didn't

641
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,200
expand it now to other

642
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
well communication

643
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,279
so for example like network server to

644
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,000
network server uh and so on

645
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,919
and but

646
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,640
so the the net um

647
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,360
in

648
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,640
if i recall uh laravan's sort of

649
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,679
architecture correctly was it not that

650
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,760
the network server and the churn server

651
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,400
actually belong to the same domain uh

652
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,080
like the admin same administrative

653
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,639
domain or

654
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,000
um

655
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,400
yes they could um

656
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,200
but we we still have like uh if we are

657
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
doing warming or so we still have like

658
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,320
different uh stakeholders

659
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,960
and even if they are in the same domain

660
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,200
uh well yes especially if we're doing

661
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,880
running if everything is in the same

662
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,559
domain we don't have any much but i

663
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,840
think the roaming part is something i i

664
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,520
read through the specifications last

665
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,960
year but my understanding was that they

666
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
made an update to the specifications to

667
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,720
support roaming but then there were some

668
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,960
other entities involved that you didn't

669
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
show and i don't know where that

670
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,640
specification actually went to whether

671
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,880
that's actually common these days or

672
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,679
whether that's um they abandoned uh that

673
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,640
effort

674
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,120
maybe where's why just from from a

675
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,679
for the sake of uh sort of having the

676
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,840
the scenario and the entities properly

677
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,919
lined up

678
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,039
um

679
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,080
yeah

680
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,799
i couldn't really say a lot a lot of

681
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,880
things are on the roaming part i know

682
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,840
how well we implemented it and

683
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,080
i'm not sure uh

684
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,760
how is the state of the implement of the

685
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,080
specification right now okay sorry i

686
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,919
think it would be interesting to have

687
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,440
the dane client

688
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,240
on on a iot device because in some sense

689
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,360
um

690
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,919
there's very little about iod in this

691
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,080
scenario uh because you're not running

692
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,799
it like it's essentially running in the

693
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,960
on the network side between two servers

694
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,200
uh and it would be nice to have it uh

695
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,279
the link client on an iot device because

696
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,279
that's where the constraints would

697
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,679
uh show up that's where you would see

698
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,720
some of the

699
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,880
maybe interactions with some low power

700
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,360
networks or whatever uh that could be

701
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,279
interesting yeah ultimately that's what

702
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,320
we want to do uh okay yeah not uh we

703
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,399
don't have that and maybe the go client

704
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,080
wouldn't be of much use there either

705
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,080
unfortunately

706
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,480
else with questions

707
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,559
yeah i can go can you hear me

708
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,080
yeah

709
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,320
uh yeah so uh

710
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,000
thank you for doing the implementation

711
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
of the drafts um

712
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,559
i was already planning to extend my

713
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,240
library to support looking up a

714
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,200
generalized tlsa record name to support

715
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,440
this so thanks for beating me to it

716
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,399
um

717
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,600
and

718
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,720
one more question i had um does the go

719
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,440
tls library still support no hooks or

720
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,360
api to implement extensions i see you

721
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,840
had to fork the entire go tls library

722
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,440
which seems a little heavyweight but i

723
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,520
assume that's probably the reason is

724
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,880
that right

725
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,600
yes the gold library that doesn't really

726
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,880
allow for

727
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,000
much

728
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,760
like extension or also so i i i just had

729
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,679
to to fork it

730
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,880
it is not like ideal and i i know it but

731
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,360
uh i didn't really really have another

732
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,000
way to do that

733
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
okay got it yeah so i i guess it might

734
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,200
be worth

735
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,720
chatting with the go folks to see if

736
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,320
they are planning to implement a

737
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,240
generalized api to

738
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,919
for for people to be able to write new

739
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,159
extensions rather than having to fork

740
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,720
the whole thing so um

741
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,919
that might be something worth looking

742
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,039
into

743
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,480
because i know openssl and other

744
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,600
libraries

745
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,320
do have apis to create extensions

746
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,080
but thank you

747
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,600
eventually it'll all be in the base and

748
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,120
nobody will have to extend it at all

749
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,960
right uh that's true

750
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,360
we might get there too

751
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,880
hi stannis um

752
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,279
like from my experience it's unavoidable

753
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,240
to incorporate uh the functionality of

754
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,720
the extensions into the core

755
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,440
because um the extensions

756
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
often require

757
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,760
changes internal to the dls stack so i

758
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,200
don't so if

759
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,279
i guess you will have no other route

760
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,240
than

761
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,159
sort of contributing your extension back

762
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,080
into the the core and you would have to

763
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,320
do the same for empathy ls for wolf ssl

764
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,200
and for

765
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,600
open ssl for that matter

766
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,720
but they are

767
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,039
all these uh folks are

768
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,440
welcoming extensions in general they're

769
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,880
very open for contributions

770
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,720
okay yeah that's a good point so i think

771
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,279
with openssl in the past i've been able

772
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,360
to implement the functionality of an

773
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,919
extension just using their api to create

774
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,200
a new extension and they have callbacks

775
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,840
for the tls verification side on the

776
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,640
server where you can add functionality

777
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,360
so

778
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,600
but you're right in the general case you

779
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,440
may have to

780
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,799
uh modify the cuts in the library

781
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,559
yeah for all the verification i am also

782
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,200
using like callbacks for um

783
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,039
in the go uh

784
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,200
implementation it's just that the

785
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,039
extension itself

786
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,879
couldn't be implemented like otherwise

787
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,760
gotcha thanks

788
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,600
with that i don't see any more questions

789
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,760
uh thank you very much for both the

790
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,519
implementation and the discussion based

791
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,919
on it um fascinating work awesome to see

792
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,320
it uh implemented so so quickly

793
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,080
uh it's thank you

794
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,240
for good progress so thanks very much

795
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,799
all right next up in the agenda is only

796
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,000
with a

797
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,840
discussion about the architecture

798
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,000
document um or any of the authors that

799
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
want to talk about it

800
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,910
i believe you are

801
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,320
[Music]

802
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,760
there you are yep fire away

803
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,519
i don't think we have slides for this so

804
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,480
we will

805
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,760
i'll put the agenda back up

806
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,519
do not hear you yet

807
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,240
your microphone was on but no actual

808
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,240
audio

809
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,960
trying again still don't hear you

810
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,979
[Music]

811
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,120
no luck so far

812
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,200
uh he's he's enjoying the audio a couple

813
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,640
of times but

814
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,480
it's not actually transmitting audio

815
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,519
somehow

816
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,200
i don't know if it's a device selection

817
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,600
problem or

818
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,360
joey joey's right you could leave me

819
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
echo and come back and try again but it

820
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,880
could be a device configuration in the

821
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,279
upper right hand corner

822
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,279
permissions

823
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,000
yes always could be permissions

824
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
we'll give a minute i think we have time

825
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,519
but um otherwise we can switch and go on

826
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,880
to schumann with the solutions documents

827
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,840
all right why don't we do that um so

828
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,480
will you continue playing um

829
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,320
why don't we switch to schumann and you

830
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,080
can talk about the solutions documents

831
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,799
in the meantime

832
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,440
uh schumann go ahead

833
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,039
you need to raise your hand

834
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,399
do you want to share the slides and

835
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,480
control them or do you want me to uh

836
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,679
actually

837
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,440
would you mind doing that

838
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,600
of course not last time i tried i messed

839
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,120
up and was

840
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,720
well a minute ago i actually left the

841
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,159
room by accident so you know

842
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,360
all right you should be good to go

843
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,120
okay all right so um this

844
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,000
is just an update on the status of the

845
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,679
protocol documents

846
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,760
uh as you know i've presented these

847
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,559
drafts in detail at a number of earlier

848
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,399
meetings so i'm not planning to go

849
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,600
through

850
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,840
the entire protocol uh this time so this

851
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,839
will be quite brief

852
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,239
even though i see i've been given 40

853
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,679
minutes for this

854
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,159
um and you might recall also that these

855
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,079
documents have existed for quite a

856
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,359
number of years

857
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,719
long before

858
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,679
the dance working group was even engaged

859
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,720
so next slide

860
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,639
and as you may have seen on the mailing

861
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,560
list and

862
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,480
what wes mentioned these two documents

863
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
were formally adopted

864
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,199
and just yesterday i renamed them with

865
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,119
the working group

866
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,320
document titles and pushed out the dash

867
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,960
zero zero versions of each of them

868
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,679
and they are the uh dane tls client

869
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,879
authentication

870
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,560
document and the pls extension for

871
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,679
conveying

872
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,040
a client stain identity

873
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,720
uh next slide please

874
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,680
and uh there was really only one change

875
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,280
that was made since the last revision

876
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,240
and that was to the tls dane client

877
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,400
identity draft

878
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,440
so

879
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,520
previously the draft said that the tls

880
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,800
server may

881
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,280
optionally send an empty extension to

882
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,920
signal the support of this mechanism

883
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,720
but

884
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,359
it turns out after some

885
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,480
reading of the spec that doesn't

886
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,680
actually work with tls 1.3 the client is

887
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,000
only allowed to send the extension in

888
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,119
its certificate message if it has seen

889
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,440
the corresponding extension in the

890
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,720
certificate request message from the tls

891
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,560
server side so it can't really be

892
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,680
optional

893
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,280
on the server side so

894
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
the text in the draft

895
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,140
has been modified to

896
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,960
[Music]

897
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,560
fix to address this

898
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,680
so

899
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,520
folks if you could please

900
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,839
give a careful read and make sure we got

901
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,040
all the

902
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,119
language right in in the draft on this

903
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,720
point that would be appreciated

904
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,439
next slide

905
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,599
okay and here's the

906
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,119
specific citation from rfc 8446 tls 1.3

907
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,200
about that which says extensions and the

908
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,640
significant message

909
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,960
from the client must correspond to

910
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,440
extensions in the certificate request

911
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,800
message from this order

912
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,040
next slide

913
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,119
here's a quick updated protocol

914
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,440
annotation diagram with the relevant

915
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,359
information highlighted in red it's just

916
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,200
the thing on the right hand side the

917
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,119
dane find any extension in the

918
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,240
certificate

919
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,320
message that's no longer optional until

920
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,880
that's one thing

921
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,400
next slide

922
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,720
uh okay so there was one uh other

923
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,880
comment on the list during the adoption

924
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,359
call uh about the content of the draft

925
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,720
specifically and that was from michael

926
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,800
richardson who says

927
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,839
that

928
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,680
uh the introduction is weak in the

929
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,760
client authentication draft

930
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,880
so uh that was kind of intentionally

931
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,560
intentional this is mainly a protocol

932
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,800
specification document and didn't go

933
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,920
into

934
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,720
a great deal

935
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,040
amount of detail about application use

936
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,720
cases specifically

937
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
but i think i do agree with michael's

938
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,760
later comment that integration

939
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,000
of this draft with the treatment of that

940
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,160
latter subject about

941
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,320
use cases in the architecture document

942
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
will likely address that

943
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,359
uh

944
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,359
but you know if there's additional text

945
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,440
that anyone feels should go into the

946
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,920
protocol specifications document uh you

947
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,680
know please bring it up and we can we

948
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,359
can discuss and decide what to do about

949
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,560
that

950
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,800
and uh yeah i'd be happy to fix the

951
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,839
capitalization of iot to conform to the

952
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,680
existing and ones in that space

953
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,920
uh

954
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,400
and the next slide

955
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,960
to sum things up we think the protocol

956
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,280
documents are largely done

957
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,760
and we're looking for feedback about

958
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,320
anything that's missing from them or

959
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,400
needs to be clarified or expanded

960
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,200
uh

961
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,960
as you just saw one issue already come

962
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,560
up came up earlier today from the

963
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,960
conversation with uh hannes and kyle

964
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,160
about

965
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,880
whether even in tls 1.3 we should send

966
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,640
an mp extension in the client hello

967
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,040
message so

968
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,880
i guess we should have a

969
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,200
chat about that and decide uh if that

970
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,720
should go into the document that

971
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,800
actually was

972
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,440
one of the uh

973
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,960
i'm reminded one of the original

974
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,640
rationales for

975
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,760
existence of the client id draft

976
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,160
and that came from a discussion actually

977
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,480
with um many years ago with with victor

978
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,240
duchovny

979
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,000
to deal with the use case in the smtp

980
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,560
transport security community where

981
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
you couldn't actually

982
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,440
um

983
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,359
uh prompt on the server side you

984
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,040
couldn't prompt the client for a

985
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,200
certificate message

986
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,040
a client certificate unilaterally

987
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,680
because there were lots of broken

988
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,960
uh tls stacks in use by uh in the smtp

989
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,320
client arena where they would get

990
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,640
confused by that so the server would

991
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,560
need an explicit indication from the

992
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,800
client that it wanted to do dain

993
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,040
authentication and only then

994
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,440
would the server actually uh prompt the

995
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,960
client for a certificate right i mean

996
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,320
that's dealing with

997
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,720
uh broken behavior so i wasn't a big fan

998
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,400
of that but that was one of the

999
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,240
one of the reasons well one of the

1000
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,320
original rationales for the client id

1001
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,079
extension so

1002
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,320
you know down the road other reasons

1003
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,560
came up such as you know surgically

1004
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,839
picking out

1005
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,079
a client identity from a certificate or

1006
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,119
supporting

1007
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,960
tlsa uh

1008
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,599
with raw public key authentication

1009
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,359
uh

1010
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,680
anyway um

1011
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,760
and uh so i do think the plan work on

1012
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,440
the architecture document may inform

1013
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,960
other things that need to be added to

1014
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
the draft but i don't know what those

1015
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,560
might be at the moment and the same goes

1016
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,319
for implementation experience and i

1017
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,680
think we've already had a little bit of

1018
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,520
discussion about that today

1019
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,400
and

1020
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,560
with that uh i think i'll stop so i have

1021
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,440
some filler slide at the end for people

1022
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,160
who aren't familiar with the entire

1023
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,480
uh uh protocol uh they can go through

1024
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,400
that but i'm not planning to talk about

1025
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,160
that today unless

1026
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,640
discussion points arise so i'll stop

1027
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,839
here

1028
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,760
yeah i would say that the the audience

1029
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,040
in the room probably already has seen

1030
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,880
them so

1031
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,319
most of them but

1032
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,480
anybody have questions or comments for

1033
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,720
the the documents i appreciate everybody

1034
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,960
having read them again and being willing

1035
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,560
to work on them i appreciate that

1036
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,160
greatly

1037
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,240
anybody have

1038
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,839
things they want to discuss or bring up

1039
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,920
certainly the must versus shoulds are a

1040
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,680
good thing for everybody to make sure

1041
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,560
are

1042
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,240
right that's always often a contentious

1043
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,240
point

1044
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,359
than that schumann it looks like you're

1045
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,680
good

1046
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,680
all right and supposedly ollie has fixed

1047
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,800
his microphone issues so

1048
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,599
uh you want to come back

1049
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,400
i hope so can you hear me yes there we

1050
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
go all right awesome

1051
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,200
fantastic

1052
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,640
uh so you don't have slides so you just

1053
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,040
uh want to chat about where we are with

1054
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,280
respect to the document it's uh

1055
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,520
from a chair's point of view it's grown

1056
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,839
uh greatly and you know it's it's neat

1057
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,240
to see so many use cases spelled out in

1058
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,590
it but go ahead

1059
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,960
[Music]

1060
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,680
uh yeah i apologize for my lack of

1061
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,119
powerpoint skills this week but uh i had

1062
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,119
to jump in uh

1063
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,720
unexpectedly

1064
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,920
uh the architecture document as it is is

1065
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,119
a collection of thoughts ideas and

1066
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,359
a lot of empty

1067
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,520
pointers

1068
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,680
as a working group we should properly

1069
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,240
take that and sort it out

1070
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,079
i forwarded to the mailing list this

1071
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,400
morning i understand if people haven't

1072
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,760
followed up on

1073
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,920
everything on mail today

1074
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,119
but we had an earlier discussion

1075
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,520
in november about the structure of

1076
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,599
documents

1077
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,480
and based on that i think we need to

1078
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,200
include the dancing rules in the

1079
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,599
architecture document that means

1080
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,160
helping people that write implementation

1081
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,480
documents

1082
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,760
like i

1083
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,400
potentially could do for sip or webrtc

1084
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,079
and others

1085
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,800
another topic is iot

1086
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,280
on considerations and requirements for

1087
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,240
those documents

1088
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,920
and that means that the iot usage that

1089
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,920
is pretty detailed in today's

1090
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,839
architecture document should probably

1091
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,240
move out to an implementation document

1092
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,960
but because of changes in the

1093
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,800
employment i believe

1094
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,200
the current editor

1095
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,160
has limited capability to do that so i

1096
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,879
should properly

1097
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,160
try to find other people to work with or

1098
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,760
take a first

1099
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,079
stab at it myself to reorganize the

1100
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,400
architecture document but

1101
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,280
as schumann pointed out we need a

1102
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,520
architecture document to go

1103
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,240
in line with the rest of our documents

1104
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
that's pretty much all i have to say to

1105
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,200
say

1106
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,960
yeah thank you for bringing that up i

1107
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,160
want one

1108
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,440
point is um ashes unfortunately has had

1109
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,400
to move away from his role in

1110
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,760
editing these documents and there is

1111
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,200
sort of a replacement author kind of

1112
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,119
stepping in as well but

1113
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,319
um

1114
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,560
if you know it would be beneficial if

1115
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,839
the author teams wish it would be

1116
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,839
beneficial to find additional editors to

1117
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,359
help push these forward especially the

1118
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,079
architecture document is fairly large

1119
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,839
please do reach out to the chairs and we

1120
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,119
can

1121
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,680
negotiate whether whether more help is

1122
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,160
needed i suspect that

1123
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,760
the architecture document is you know

1124
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,560
fairly large in particular

1125
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,119
harness is running to the mic

1126
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,680
um

1127
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,599
yeah

1128
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,040
i had participated in earlier

1129
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,119
discussions but then sort of like got

1130
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,160
lost in other activities and so um

1131
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,000
just help me to provide a little bit of

1132
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,280
get a little bit of context so the

1133
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,280
architecture document is that still an

1134
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,960
individual document is that's the one

1135
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
you're referring to or is are we talking

1136
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,800
about something else here

1137
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,880
yeah it's not currently a working group

1138
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
document it's an individual document

1139
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,680
with a couple of authors yes

1140
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,000
okay and like

1141
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,079
so i hear you've got i'm saying

1142
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,400
essentially you want to

1143
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,240
sort of cut that architecture into

1144
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,200
pieces and and have a sort of like

1145
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,960
classical architecture document but then

1146
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,319
implement there's guidance document for

1147
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,800
uh individual areas uh

1148
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,040
like iot sip and you mentioned other

1149
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,920
things is that is that yeah

1150
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,680
that that was what we discussed in

1151
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,040
november

1152
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,720
saying that the architecture document

1153
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,040
which was really the document we had at

1154
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,400
the both

1155
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,800
uh should be slimmed down to more

1156
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,720
classical as you say architecture

1157
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,920
document but also include

1158
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,119
rules and requirements for implementers

1159
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,520
that want to write documents for

1160
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,079
the various other areas like iot

1161
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,520
like sip or other things yes

1162
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,200
point of order from

1163
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,119
what we agreed to during the charting to

1164
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,520
chartering discussion was

1165
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,640
uh we would start with the two existing

1166
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,560
solution documents and we would add an

1167
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,160
architecture document to help lay out

1168
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,440
the framework

1169
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,400
and

1170
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,640
that additional protocols and things

1171
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,480
like that would be you know subject to

1172
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,160
rechartering at some point in the future

1173
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,480
after we got stuff done so

1174
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,680
you're absolutely right there's a

1175
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,560
contention between how much you know

1176
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,160
individual protocols can be put into the

1177
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,400
architecture document i think defining

1178
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,119
the use case examples is a safe way to

1179
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,480
do that right you could you could

1180
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,839
include pieces in the architecture

1181
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,000
document for this is how we expect it to

1182
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,720
be used but we're not defining it now

1183
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,319
not normal text so

1184
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,880
i'm curious what it makes you like when

1185
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
whether you want to adopt an

1186
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,480
architecture document as a working group

1187
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,800
item to actually then

1188
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,319
make some progress on this rather than

1189
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,800
having it linguish around in a working

1190
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,280
group as an individual document uh for a

1191
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,720
while

1192
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,319
um

1193
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,079
you had all this i remember we had these

1194
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,839
discussions um during the chartering

1195
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,000
process and there was an iot use case

1196
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,560
which was pretty fancy and and uh

1197
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,960
um i'm hoping to see some of that sort

1198
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,480
of being

1199
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,839
sort of picked up somewhere and

1200
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,680
showcased and so on

1201
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,240
or like hackathon wise and then

1202
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,760
described also in some architecture

1203
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,200
document i think that would be pretty

1204
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,160
cool

1205
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,079
but i understand like obviously like the

1206
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,079
eap use case and other use case which

1207
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,119
are more

1208
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,240
like

1209
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,280
nuances of uh the architecture

1210
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,640
and uh

1211
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,200
yeah i don't i don't know so so the

1212
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,400
reason

1213
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,319
uh one of the other things that came out

1214
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,160
of the chartering discussion was to push

1215
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,240
especially the solutions forward without

1216
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,480
letting them languish behind so that's

1217
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,839
actually the reason i did the call for

1218
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,440
adoption for them first they were really

1219
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,079
ready to go if the architecture document

1220
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,319
if people feel that it is ready to be

1221
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,640
adopted uh we will certainly call a call

1222
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,280
for adoption and i would let um only in

1223
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,359
the the authors actually you know uh

1224
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,000
discuss or dictate when that might be

1225
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,240
when a good time to to do that might be

1226
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,920
i know jim is um

1227
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,760
asking in chat as well why hasn't it

1228
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,760
been adopted uh last i checked there

1229
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,079
were still sections that weren't um uh

1230
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,760
fully fleshed out

1231
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,520
yeah

1232
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,160
so uh we probably need to take a stab at

1233
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,720
cleaning up a bit um

1234
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,920
before for that but uh i i can come up

1235
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,920
with a proposal on that

1236
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,599
for discussion

1237
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,760
uh there is also some technical issues

1238
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,599
but i'm i'm sure we can solve that

1239
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,520
quickly that i think

1240
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,440
ash is the one with the commit rights on

1241
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,200
the github ripple but

1242
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,160
that's

1243
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,400
things that are easy to solve

1244
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,559
yeah that's that's a management issue

1245
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,880
all right uh barry you have a comment no

1246
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,000
this is barry liba i always question why

1247
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,839
we often seem to think that documents

1248
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,680
have to be substantially ready before

1249
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,960
they're adopted

1250
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,640
um the working group is going to be

1251
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,640
working on the document if we're going

1252
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,480
to do an architecture document and we

1253
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,240
have a framework for it even an outline

1254
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,079
we should just adopt it and call it a

1255
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,920
working group product and start working

1256
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,680
on it

1257
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,920
right right so let me ask a different

1258
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
question is there any objection to doing

1259
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,480
a i will call for a call for adoption

1260
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,920
anybody actually think it would be a bad

1261
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,079
idea to adopt it as is or ollie are you

1262
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,079
okay with it if we issue it now

1263
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,920
absolutely

1264
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,920
i'm okay all right there's a lot of

1265
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,400
agreements and plus ones and in chat so

1266
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,000
um joey and i will

1267
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,800
probably start but

1268
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,520
we probably need to bring up what

1269
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,440
we agreed on on on the mailing list

1270
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,200
there as well

1271
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,200
but

1272
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,040
you know barry's 100 right

1273
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,559
it does not need to be finished it just

1274
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,319
needs to be the point where the working

1275
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,800
group thinks that the the rough layout

1276
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,040
outline is very put is is in good shape

1277
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,680
and

1278
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,559
uh last i looked at it i think it is so

1279
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,319
excellent i think we will

1280
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,800
issue that next week then

1281
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,079
great

1282
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,599
okay

1283
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,559
anything else from you

1284
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,200
nope nope okay

1285
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,440
um that actually brings us to the end of

1286
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,520
the agenda as i said um you know i was

1287
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,200
debating when i was selecting a room

1288
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,880
we've always filled two hours before

1289
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,240
with discussion

1290
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,880
uh and we did not this time so i think

1291
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,800
you know next time unless we think that

1292
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,079
there's a lot more content we'll

1293
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,760
probably shoot for a one hour slot to

1294
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,200
leave these uh larger slots open uh for

1295
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,880
for more discussion

1296
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,440
um so do keep that in mind and i think

1297
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,359
uh next time i will default to one hour

1298
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,920
unless uh people you know feel like we

1299
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,920
have a lot more uh based on discussions

1300
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,480
on the mailing list and stuff as well so

1301
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,559
um anybody have

1302
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,839
anything for open mic or um other

1303
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,440
solutions that you want to discuss with

1304
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,640
respect to

1305
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,160
dance related technologies

1306
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,640
okay i don't see anybody dancing to the

1307
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,079
microphone so i think with that we will

1308
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,040
close very very early and call it good

1309
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,880
thank you everybody for coming and good

1310
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,559
progress today and

1311
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,599
we will issue a call for adoption

1312
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,960
uh shortly and send a note to the

1313
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,520
mailing list

1314
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,640
thank you paul for helping out in the

1315
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,240
room

1316
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,319
thank you tim very much for taking notes

1317
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,280
i've been following them along

1318
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,680
thank you everybody

1319
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,800
upstairs

1320
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,240
you
