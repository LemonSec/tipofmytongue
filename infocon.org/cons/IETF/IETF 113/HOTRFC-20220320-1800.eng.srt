37
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,780
[Music]

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,720
this will surprise no one right

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,120
and

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,360
so just to get just to get uh

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,400
get started here

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
i have a few ground rules that will be

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
very short and

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,160
i hope uh helpful for people

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,519
the

46
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,040
hot rfc is a request for conversation

47
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,319
and

48
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,239
it's a good way to find people to talk

49
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,560
to for various reasons

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,080
um

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
barry are you in the queue

52
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,000
oh okay thank you

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,760
it works

54
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,480
yes

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,519
the queue the qs testing is working also

56
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,800
um

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,159
you know i'm serious it takes a lot of

58
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,319
people to keep an eye on me

59
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,920
um

60
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,239
but hot rfc is a thing we started

61
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,000
probably about four or five years ago

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
that is a good way to

63
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
find people at the itf to talk to you

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
for various reasons

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
and we don't ever really ask what

66
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,360
reasons people have for wanting to talk

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,319
for four minutes because that's how long

68
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,599
people talk

69
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
is for four minutes

70
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,720
i have

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
not

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
i'm a working group chair and we use

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,239
meat echo but

74
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,720
we never meet in person

75
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,840
so

76
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,720
i'm

77
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,120
going to be learning a couple of things

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,599
as we go as i'm bringing people in and

79
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,360
out of the queue

80
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,720
so

81
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
the each speaker gets four minutes and

82
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,040
your time does not start until i say go

83
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,360
so that you don't have to

84
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,079
you know the uh be fumbling is

85
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,440
yeah my time not out of yours

86
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,080
and then uh at the end of four minutes

87
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
or at the end of your talk we will all

88
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,919
applaud

89
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
and when that happens please hand the

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,720
microphone over

91
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,960
we don't do questions here

92
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,880
so each person who's speaking is

93
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,199
providing follow-up information

94
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,639
and uh the con the conversations can

95
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,759
begin

96
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,600
at any point

97
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,440
i know that i notice now that we are

98
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,960
meeting earlier on

99
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,280
sunday nights

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
you can grab somebody in the hallway and

101
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,400
go to dinner

102
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,719
maybe

103
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,680
but do the right thing

104
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,680
so this is our agenda for tonight

105
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,400
um if i'm remembering right we have uh

106
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,039
eight speakers yeah um and uh a variety

107
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,600
of topics which is always true for

108
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,880
an rfc

109
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,400
and so

110
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,479
i should also mention that about

111
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,479
half of our presenters i think are

112
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,840
remote

113
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
so

114
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,280
we will make sure that they are

115
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,039

116
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,560

133
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,198

136
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,840
okay

137
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,639
uh

138
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,199

various quality of communication

176
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
services and the idea is this could

177
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,320
benefit even a completely qos ignorant

178
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,800
application using ordinary unmodified

179
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
apis and what sort of things are you

180
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,800
talking about possibly

181
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
ways to get

182
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,680
improved bandwidth or latency or

183
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,080
whatever by tweaking header fields or

184
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,760
maybe using a slice if you have network

185
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,600
slicing and things like that this would

186
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,320
mostly be useful in a localized domain

187
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
no on the wire protocol changes and of

188
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
course if the application is aware of

189
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,519
qos and things like that it can perhaps

190
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,160
have better control and be able to do

191
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,200
more

192
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,600
detailed and complicated things so what

193
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
happens when you make a network

194
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
connection these days it's pretty easy

195
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,040
your application typically goes to the

196
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,320
dns the name gets back an address makes

197
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,880
a connection you talk to this uh remote

198
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,279
network interface

199
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,920
so what would be different with this

200
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,040
idea

201
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,080
well the idea is that you somehow encode

202
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,480
the qos desired in the request of the

203
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,600
dns

204
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,360
and in the dns response there's

205
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
information about the method for

206
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,240
obtaining that qos and and possibly the

207
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
application that's using its ordinary

208
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,120
apis

209
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
you know doesn't really understand that

210
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,200
but maybe your first hop router or some

211
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,440
early hop router understands that and

212
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
can tweak your packets to get the

213
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,320
desired effect

214
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
so how are you going to do that well the

215
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
dns request the best flexible part is

216
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
the name you're querying and there's a

217
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,480
separate draft which talks about how to

218
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,240
express qos requirements in dns requests

219
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,800
and for responses the idea is to use

220
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
semantic addressing and that means that

221
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
the address does more than just identify

222
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
a network interface but also has

223
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
additional information about how to

224
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
connect to that address for example

225
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
in the low order bits

226
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,079
so maybe just get a quad a record back

227
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,680
and lower the bits tell you how to

228
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,279
actually do it and as i mentioned the

229
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,000
first or an early hop router can make

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,399
selected modifications perhaps to the

231
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,240
packets on the fly or make the right

232
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
routing there

233
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,519
so

234
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,680
in the case of an application which has

235
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,360
no changes at all

236
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,200
then you have to have it be configured

237
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,399
with or somehow give it this dns name

238
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,560
which has this qos in it

239
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
if it's dns name knowledgeable then it

240
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,320
can construct such names perhaps to

241
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,880
request various qualities of service uh

242
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,480
maybe in the extension of all this

243
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
there'd be new rr types not just

244
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,600
semantic addressing where you just get

245
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
an address

246
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,399
and of course you can combine two and

247
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
three together

248
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,839
so what kind of

249
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,360
quality service are we talking about in

250
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
a course level you might want to just

251
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,440
say i'd like minimum latency because i'm

252
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
a gaming application or i want maximum

253
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
bandwidth or the like you'd also like to

254
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,839
be able to specify uh more precise

255
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,600
metrics uh perhaps some maximum jitter

256
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
in microseconds or or

257
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,920
minimum bandwidth and megabits or

258
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,920
whatever

259
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
so for more information uh there's this

260
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,800
draft on how to express these

261
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,480
requirements for uh qos and there's a

262
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,160
draft on uh semantic routing and uh how

263
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,639
you song and i are the authors of this

264
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,279
and hopefully uh people will get more

265
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,040
information i am by the way presenting

266
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,440
on the expressing qos requirements draft

267
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,920
during the dns op working group meeting

268
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,440
this week

269
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,920
so that's it

270
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,759
[Applause]

271
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,800
thank you donald

hello

282
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,480
and i am uh sharing preloaded slides for

283
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,040
you and

284
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,079
it looks like this one

285
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,360
is that working for you

286
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,360
yes

287
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,079
trying to remember

288
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,319
do you

289
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,399
how do i put you in charge of this

290
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,760
oh i need to hover over mark's name

291
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,120
cool there

292
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,720
and

293
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,279
this one

294
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,480
test slide control

295
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,959
yeah okay yeah perfect for it

296
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,120
thank you lorenzo also from the back

297
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,839
room

298
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,959
um cool

299
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,760
um so mark can you can you control your

300
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,360
slides now

301
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,360
i do not see how uh oh yeah okay i see

302
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,279
all right yes i can

303
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,600
okay excellent

304
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,519
so i am

305
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,519
telling you when to um

306
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,519
when to start and

307
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,040
um

308
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,399
you can start

309
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,760
now go

310
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,800
hi so my name is mark pettigon and i'm

311
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,519
going to talk about verified internal

312
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,199
draft using computerized specifications

313
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,240
so

314
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,519
the idea of a computerized specification

315
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,639
is to combine three things is to combine

316
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,920
a

317
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,720
document format in this case i chose

318
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
ascii docker

319
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,360
a so-called dependently type programming

320
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,560
language

321
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,160
i chose idris ii which is a one that was

322
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,000
fitting my need

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,079
and this is augmented with the ability

324
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,560
to take the result of a computation done

325
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,959
in idris 2 and to inject the result of

326
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,199
this inside the document that is

327
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,240
processed

328
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,959
so i developed a tooling

329
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,440
which permits to to take a document in

330
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,079
this format and to generate

331
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,000
an xml to rfc v3 file

332
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,560
from this specification ready to be

333
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,639
submitted as an internet draft

334
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,639
so here's a little bit how it looks so

335
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,480
this is in three parts on the top you

336
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,720
have an extract of an existing computer

337
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,759
right specification which was lfc 8492

338
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:32,320
889 sorry and you can see that you have

339
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,560
on top you have after

340
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,360
on

341
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,279
on the left you have this symbol which

342
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,600
is called bird marker

343
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
which signal where the code is so this

344
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,199
is some idris code and then you have the

345
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,240
text

346
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
which has uh the insertion of the of

347
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,839
some results which start with a

348
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,360
and are between a packet right

349
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,680
so the text here

350
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
will be converted into a

351
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,320
credible text

352
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
so the second box is the command which

353
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,440
is executed to generate so you can see

354
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,720
here

355
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
from this text we simultaneously

356
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,040
generate the xml to lfc the text html

357
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
and the pdf file

358
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
from that and on the bottom you see the

359
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,399
result of this which

360
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,000
which is a various

361
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
transmission so the idea is that you can

362
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,920
simply change one of this parameter

363
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,759
number transmission

364
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,839
or delay and the system will

365
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,639
automatically generate the correct thing

366
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,920
which is on the pattern

367
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,120
so the problem is that uh using idris

368
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,519
and the computer rate specification that

369
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,440
way is quite difficult it takes some

370
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,480
time to write this code so

371
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,360
what i have been doing for the last few

372
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,399
months is to write standard libraries

373
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,120
that contain

374
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,160
trade defined libraries

375
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,280
for various things that are useful for

376
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,919
people that are writing ietf

377
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,400
and internet craft right

378
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,480
so this is done by using what's so

379
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,520
called embedded dsl dsl is a domain

380
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,319
specific language and which permit to

381
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,119
construct some interesting things and to

382
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,480
do that

383
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,799
right right so i have a library for

384
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,160
denominate numbers abnf

385
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,559
and petrinet which is still under

386
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,480
development that there is other in

387
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,000
development too

388
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,880
so just to show you how it works with

389
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,039
an abn fd dsl

390
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,000
you can see on the top you have again

391
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
the code and the text

392
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
so the code is a sim

393
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,640
simple usage of this adsl to define uh

394
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,600
here uh an abnf rule

395
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
and then the code

396
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,679
uh text which is just underneath we

397
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,840
generate the thing so it does two things

398
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,160
it verifies that your ibnf is correct

399
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
and by correct i mean that

400
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,720
all the rules have

401
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,360
a different name that all the names are

402
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,720
used at least one it verifies also that

403
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,799
your ibnf doesn't loop right which is

404
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,360
something which is not verified very

405
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,400
often

406
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,440
but in the in addition what it does is

407
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,400
that it generates the alpha and the

408
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,960
text on the nif

409
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,480
so

410
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,960
that's that's that's all if you want to

411
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
to know more there is a document that

412
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,480
contains everything including how to

413
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,000
download and install the tool

414
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,400
[Applause]

415
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,679
thank you mark

416
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,520
um and so we would have paul conga

417
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,559
talking next i believe

418
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,539
[Music]

419
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,399
i think so

420
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,520
i think i have to turn oh there we go

421
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,559
okay yeah

422
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,600
i'm getting better at this i swear

423
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
okay

424
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,160
but haven't said go yet so

425
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
let me

426
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,880
yeah

427
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,440
you're on okay my name is paul condon

428
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,760
and i want to discuss with you a couple

429
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,440
initiatives that are taking place in the

430
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,600
ieee that i think are of interest to the

431
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,960
ietf

432
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,000
um

433
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,960
and particularly ieee 802.1 next slide

434
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,480
please

435
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,840
um

436
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,600
so first of all i'm gonna be talking

437
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
about standards going on in the ieee

438
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,679
it's just my personal view i have to

439
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,840
show that disclaimer slide next next one

440
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
please

441
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
uh so there's three initiatives that i

442
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,320
think are most interesting motivated by

443
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,120
low latency low loss high reliability

444
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,679
ethernet based data center networks that

445
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,400
support rdma and ai and hpc work gloves

446
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
the three initiatives are congestion

447
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,799
isolation i've talked about this before

448
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,919
uh in other hot rfcs as well as

449
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,240
iccrg and other places

450
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,200
uh pfc enhancements and source flow

451
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,280
control all of these are amendments to

452
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,000
the big standard 802.1 queue

453
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,679
and you can find a lot more background

454
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,280
information on this paper we published

455
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,960
recently about date lossless data

456
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,280
centers next slide please

457
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,360
so real quick congestion isolation if

458
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
you're familiar with the way data center

459
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,559
networking works today

460
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,360
we're using ecn marking to indicate

461
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,280
congestion that gets fed back to the

462
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,240
source

463
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
and and hopefully the source slows down

464
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,840
quickly enough if it doesn't happen

465
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,440
quick enough we may

466
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,559
invoke priority-based flow control pfc

467
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,960
in order to not drop any packets because

468
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
loss is a problem with some of these

469
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,400
protocols so what

470
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,360
there are some problems with

471
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,720
priority-based flow control in

472
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,320
particular it creates head of line

473
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,640
blocking congestion spreading

474
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,400
it's difficult to use

475
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,880
um so congestion isolation what it does

476
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,280
is it identifies the flows that are

477
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,760
causing that congestion and it uses a

478
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,000
separate cue or a separate traffic class

479
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,159
and so it moves them out of the way in

480
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,840
an attempt to avoid uh using pfc it has

481
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,799
a signaling message that goes one hop up

482
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,559
and it can be a layer two or a layer

483
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,880
three message uh again i've told a lot

484
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,320
about the standard in the past it's

485
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,559
pretty much done it's in its final stage

486
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,720
the equivalent of last call

487
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,200
next slide

488
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,480
so

489
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
pfc as i mentioned is still used today

490
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,200
however it's very difficult for many

491
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,960
people to use um

492
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,360
it has it requires that you calculate

493
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,200
what's called headroom which is the

494
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,120
amount of buffer you need in order to

495
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
absorb packets in flight

496
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,320
and

497
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,480
that's dependent on cable length but

498
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,880
also internal delays and implementation

499
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,080
details so it's complicated to figure

500
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
out what pfc

501
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
headroom should be

502
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,520
so this enhancement uses the time

503
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
persistent time protocol to

504
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,039
automatically measure

505
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,039
the delays between the end stations and

506
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,120
automatically calculate that pfc so

507
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,840
there's no requirement for user

508
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,400
configuration we also found a problem

509
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,679
with pfc being encrypted over maxsec

510
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,880
protocol

511
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,559
and so we're going to fix that as well

512
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,360
in this enhancement next slide please

513
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,559
i think the one that you're going to be

514
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,880
interested in is source flow control now

515
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,600
i i source flow control

516
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
uses some of the ideas of congestion

517
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,520
isolation but it doesn't move any

518
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
traffic to a different queue what it

519
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,679
does is it signals across the network

520
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,000
and remotely invokes priority-based flow

521
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,760
control so it avoids some of the

522
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,000
problems of priority-based flow control

523
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
uh in doing that

524
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,679
and uh

525
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,360
again this is a brand new project just

526
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,960
getting started so it's an opportunity

527
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,039
for people to to get involved so the

528
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,799
next slide

529
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,919
so i have scheduled a a side meeting for

530
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,480
this week to go into the details of all

531
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,200
these protocols in much more deep depth

532
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,760
we do have a non-ietf working group

533
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,520
mailing list that's been around for a

534
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,960
while as well that's for people

535
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
interested in congestion control for

536
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,240
rdma

537
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
and i'm going to use a

538
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
microsoft teams as well during that side

539
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,400
meeting so try to bring other people in

540
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,440
so

541
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,080
i made it

542
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,320
it was perfect thank you

543
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,320
close that deck and

544
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,080
yeah next one is ulrich

545
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,320
and let me bring your slides up

546
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,120
that would be too lovely

547
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,720
you are

548
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,679
the trustworthy digital supply guy

549
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,000
sorry

550
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,720
no that's that one of these there's a

551
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,440
multi-signer somewhere yeah

552
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,279
yeah that one okay

553
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,480
and i am doing that one

554
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,480
and

555
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,679
there we go

556
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,600
okay and

557
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,080
we are

558
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,039
go

559
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,039
okay hello my name is olej vista i work

560
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,039
for the swedish internet foundation and

561
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,200
this work combined with schumann hook

562
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
and we are working with a whole group in

563
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
the multi-signer project

564
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
next slide please

565
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,600
and

566
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,559
so the

567
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,000
our goal is to

568
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,960
fix some inconsistencies in the dns sec

569
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,400
rfcs

570
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,360
and the next slide please

571
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,440
and uh so a short recap of what

572
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,600
multisign is it basically is the idea

573
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
that you have a dns zone and you have

574
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,039
two independent signers of the zone that

575
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,640
signs the zone and dispute it on the

576
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,919
internet

577
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,799
and

578
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,520
for this to work you have to exchange zs

579
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,400
case

580
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,720
and uh next slide please

581
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,240
let me hop over that one next slide

582
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,120
please

583
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,480
this is just for reference if you want

584
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,880
to look at this narrator so there is a

585
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,039
challenge in this

586
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:27,860
that um

587
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,440
[Music]

588
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,840
the providers have to use the same

589
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,600
algorithm and if they use different

590
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,960
algorithms

591
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,159
then

592
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,440
you've got problems you can't do this

593
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,360
basically with today's

594
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,840
rfcs and

595
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
we think that isn't

596
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,520
a problem that should be closed because

597
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,360
one of the um

598
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,200
let's say special applications of

599
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600
multisignup is you can

600
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,919
have a signer currently and you would

601
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,320
like to move your domain to a different

602
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,360
signer

603
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,600
and you don't want to go insecure

604
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,440
then you need to do multi-signer in the

605
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,400
middle

606
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,480
and

607
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,400
well if you're big enough maybe they

608
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,799
would the the

609
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,720
service providers would uh

610
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
humor you and use support the algorithm

611
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,120
you want but for most of us this won't

612
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,799
happen and you just have to use what

613
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,480
they get you give you and if they give

614
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
you different algorithms

615
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,279
you can do this okay next slide please

616
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,720
and so the

617
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,320
the problem is that um in the um

618
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,080
the nsx rfc it says that any uh if there

619
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,360
is a

620
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,120
in your dns key set

621
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,080
then you have to have signatures for it

622
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,960
and

623
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,039
next slide please

624
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,960
and of course if you have a signer that

625
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,640
doesn't support one of the algorithms

626
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,320
then you can't do that

627
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,679
and so then

628
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,720
there's an another rc that says

629
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,360
well if you are a resolver you shouldn't

630
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,520
look at this you should only see if

631
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
there is some valid signature and then

632
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,760
you should accept the whole thing

633
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,559
and

634
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,080
obviously these

635
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,720
two rfcs are not totally

636
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,440
in sync about what's the right way to go

637
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,400
here

638
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,279
and so next slide please

639
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,159
and

640
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:12,880
one

641
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,320
we think one of the

642
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,120
part of the fix could be this in rfc

643
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,640
6840

644
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,880
there there's it says should not insist

645
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,200
on this uh on all algorithms and um well

646
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,039
an obvious solution here would be a must

647
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,919
not uh that would make life very much

648
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,279
easier for us

649
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,600
next slide please

650
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
so and then there is a validation

651
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,840
requirements obviously so if a resolver

652
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,200
gets an

653
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,520
answer and it doesn't support the

654
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,080
algorithm that just this

655
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,880
nameserver instance gives back

656
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,960
then obviously there's a problem

657
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,080
and

658
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,159
we would need to find a fix for that and

659
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,679
that is why we're here today because

660
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,559
there's

661
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,320
some questions left with this how we

662
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,480
make this work and we would very much

663
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,399
like input from the community and next

664
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,440
slide please because um

665
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,520
this is the next problem it's downgrade

666
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,640
protection because we heard a lot about

667
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,840
this you know having all algorithms in

668
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,440
all signatures

669
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,720
is a type of downgrade protection and

670
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
well maybe it is but i think we would

671
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,559
need to talk about the security

672
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,440
properties of the whole solution

673
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,760
and i think there's hope hopefully some

674
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,320
people here in the room that can

675
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,240
are more qualified to discuss it than i

676
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,159
am and we would be really happy to talk

677
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,520
to you

678
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,000
and with that i

679
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,080
have one second

680
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,200
left

681
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,080
i'm done the rest is just and and this

682
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,399
and so this is your rest life right uh

683
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,320
cool thank you yes

684
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,639
thank you

685
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,159
and i believe that brings us to

686
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
kieran

687
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,080
and

688
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,879
i think karen was yeah kieran is remote

689
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,200
let me let me find slides for that

690
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,880
and

691
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,720
can you hear me

692
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,720
this is visualization of plc right

693
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,039
yes

694
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,320
okay

695
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,200
and i'm sharing that

696
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,520
and uh let me

697
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,399
figure out how to

698
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,640
oh sorry

699
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,799
i think you should be able to control uh

700
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,799
the slides now

701
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,639
and let me reset a timer

702
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,000
you so you can control the slides are

703
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,120
you seeing the controls for that

704
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,399
okay

705
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,960
hi everyone my name is karen

706
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,440
um i'm receiving a lot of feedback is it

707
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,440
just me or is it coming from the room

708
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,960
yeah

709
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,559
if you're not if you're not presenting

710
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,760
please mute definitely

711
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,760
uh so uh i'm trying to promote a topic

712
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,880
on industry control networks and uh

713
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
as you know automation in industry

714
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,799
and factory flows is growing there is

715
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,720
there are a lot of sensors and devices

716
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,600
that make automation happen and control

717
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
processes on the factory floors and

718
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,120
behind all the sensors and devices they

719
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,320
are controlled by um rugged computers

720
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,159
called plc's

721
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,159
and they are the basic building blocks

722
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,720
of process control and automation

723
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,840
and

724
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,360
they are helping autom robotics motion

725
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,519
control smart manufacturing smart

726
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,840
factory type of use cases

727
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,279
and as the automation is improving these

728
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,000
plc's need to perform a lot more complex

729
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,480
tasks which means they should have more

730
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,919
processing power and more memory to run

731
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,519
more number of scan cycles

732
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,559
and they come in different sizes so yeah

733
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,880
and it depends on what kind of process

734
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,480
they are controlling it could be

735
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
something as simple as receiving the

736
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,640
temperature information or inserting the

737
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,640
pressure changing the wall uh values or

738
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,799
it could be more complex processes where

739
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,279
you're controlling multiple

740
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,919
sensors and actuators together or it

741
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,559
could be one plc controlling uh multiple

742
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,600
other plc's so the general architecture

743
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,760
for the plc is on the left hand side

744
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,320
that you have a control unit which

745
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,320
comprises of cpu and memory where you go

746
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
from where you do all the programmable

747
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,720
aspect and then there are io modules

748
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,799
that actually control the actuators

749
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,679
those sensors on the factory floor

750
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,240
so my idea is actually this idea is

751
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,640
pretty common uh and it's picking up the

752
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,679
trend is can we virtualize the control

753
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,200
unit away from the i o modules it has uh

754
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,519
several benefits that now you can

755
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,919
control the size of a

756
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,880
control unit you could customize

757
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,120
memory and power a compute power based

758
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,519
on your requirement and you also don't

759
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,640
need to build up uh rugged cages or

760
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,880
something to maintain your plc's on the

761
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,399
factory floor because

762
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,840
many times they are in the harsh

763
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,080
environments

764
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,279
um but so it's a great idea to work on

765
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,480
virtualization but the structure of how

766
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,720
information flows on factory flows is

767
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,399
pretty hierarchical

768
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,880
and one of the key requirement for

769
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,360
supporting virtualized plc is to de

770
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,200
disaggregate this thing

771
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,240
and how the network will change

772
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,559
this is what i'm working on we will try

773
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,799
to answer some of those questions that

774
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,240
how do you deploy

775
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,799
virtualized plcs and what are the

776
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,000
different properties of

777
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
the plcs in terms of addresses

778
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,640
verification how you allocate compute

779
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,799
resources to those devices

780
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,000
and some other questions listed here

781
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
i will talk about this thing in more

782
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,799
detail for enduring iot ops and i've

783
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,320
posted

784
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,960
the time for the meeting as well as

785
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,799
where we can have discussion

786
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,640
if you guys are interested in this work

787
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,159
please join me

788
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,480
thank you

789
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,730
[Applause]

790
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,840
and

791
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,519
is uh berta

792
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,760
uh

793
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,000
let me let me bring up your slides

794
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,960
and then we can get you going

795
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,440
and

796
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,480
is the why there you have

797
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,719
yep

798
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,879
okay so we have that up and i'm

799
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,839
restarting your timer

800
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,520
you're on

801
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,000
so hello my name is berta seracanta and

802
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,320
i'm a phd student from universidad

803
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,880
politecnica de catalonia and today i'm

804
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,800
going to talk about wide area network

805
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,560
auto scaling for cloud applications

806
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,480
next slides please

807
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,720
um so imagine we have this scenario

808
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,119
where there are three main parts and the

809
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,200
first one would be a company branch

810
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,599
where there are all the users located

811
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,240
the second one would be the cloud side

812
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,160
where there are the applications that

813
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
these users consume

814
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,040
and finally the third one would be

815
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,119
software-defined network which links

816
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,119
both the users and the applications and

817
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,359
provides some connectivity

818
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,480
um

819
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,200
and now imagine in this scenario we have

820
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,760
a growing number of users that

821
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,320
require this application so the load

822
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,280
grows and the cloud decides to allocate

823
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,839
more resources to that application so it

824
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,599
can manage all the requests that they

825
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,119
are getting

826
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,280
next slide please

827
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,160
um so if we now look at this situation

828
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,079
we have seen that the cloud has done

829
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,920
something which is great

830
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,320
um but there's the danger that now the

831
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
network becomes the bottleneck

832
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,119
so

833
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,960
um

834
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,400
what we are proposing is a solution that

835
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,200
um

836
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,359
tries to understand what's happening on

837
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,160
the cloud so they can network and do the

838
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,440
similar things

839
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,000
so we can avoid having this bottleneck

840
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,079
next slide please

841
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,720
so how can the network react to these

842
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,040
cloud auto scaling events um in the

843
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,560
cloud there are two different things

844
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,359
done

845
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,960
the first one being vertical auto

846
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,200
scaling which means adding more

847
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,720
resources to

848
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,640
replicas of the application that are

849
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,280
already deployed and the second one is

850
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,119
horizontal auto scaling which means

851
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,599
deploying more replicas of

852
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,079
the application to distribute the load

853
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,520
more evenly

854
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,280
so by leveraging the software defined

855
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
networking's capabilities and its

856
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,760
underlays we have proposed a solution

857
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,280
based on

858
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,760
the right path and allocating

859
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,070
elastic bandwidth on terminals

860
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,240
[Music]

861
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,520
to translate

862
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,680
how to scaling to be also done in the

863
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,800
network

864
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,839
and if you want to see more of actually

865
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,680
how we have implemented this you can

866
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,920
come and see us at panargy

867
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,760
presentation that takes place on

868
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,560
thursday at 1pm

869
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,880
and also we have

870
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,200
a paper so if you want to scan the qr

871
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,040
code feel free to do so

872
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,850
thank you

873
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:37,259
[Applause]

874
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,200
um hank are you here

875
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,160
ah okay excellent walk slow and i'll get

876
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,640
your slides up

877
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,040
no no

878
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,839
there's the box

879
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,640
is that a clock

880
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,240
see

881
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,640
i guess that's a clock

882
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,839
hi i'm hank

883
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,160
and i'm going to talk about

884
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,359
let me let me let me start our our uh to

885
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,680
reset our timer

886
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,440
and

887
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,079
here we are

888
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,720
item will be over time

889
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,079
the presentations are getting shorter no

890
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,760
no no no pressure no pressure at all

891
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,000
let me unpack the first slide slowly

892
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,839
so the title is trustworthy digital

893
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,040
supply chain transparency services and

894
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,920
uh so i'm i'm here on behalf a lot of

895
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,359
people talking about this and so let me

896
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,920
unpack the um the end of the parenthesis

897
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,000
here there's a email list

898
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
on the slide that's skit

899
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and skip means supply chain integrity

900
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,880
transparency and trust so if you are

901
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,359
interested in the topic supply to that

902
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,000
itf email list um there are weekly

903
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,720
meetings on mondays all this is not on

904
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,119
the slide deck but we have to present

905
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,400
hot rfc stuff here and this uh two

906
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,200
types of uh content one of those about

907
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,800
architecture and one is about a specific

908
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,770
cozy um

909
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,200
[Music]

910
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,440
standard we want to promote here so

911
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,400
that's a hot rfc and already wasted a

912
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,560
minute so let's go for the next slide i

913
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,280
have four slides

914
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,320
so so all of you know supply chains

915
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,400
there's a very specific one that's

916
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,040
interesting to the itf i think because

917
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,119
is about software and i think there's a

918
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,119
lot of hype about software right now

919
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,359
because there's a executive order i

920
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,839
heard about in the u.s and it's somehow

921
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:50,720
about

922
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,000
securing

923
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,800
cyber security and i guess it's about

924
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,400
software and also something called the

925
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,640
software build of material but in the

926
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,200
end all this is going to

927
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,960
solve a problem and the problem is the

928
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,040
auditability of all of that and i think

929
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,800
we as an itf

930
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
we can help there because all of these

931
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,640
red texts

932
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,280
in this example that i just pulled from

933
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,359
slides that we will present at sectors

934
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,119
patch by the way

935
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,480
on tuesday shows a lot of problems that

936
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,040
we can uh want to want more transparency

937
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,280
about and supply chains so next slide

938
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,599
please

939
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,760
so now i'm going to do a quick dive into

940
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,960
the two things which are the

941
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
architecture and the res receipts on

942
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,359
here so let's start with the left left

943
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,599
right side first right

944
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,680
and and and then you have the artifact

945
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,880
in your supply chain it can be

946
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,560
everything can be a fish

947
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,520
it can be a s-bomb that's very on vogue

948
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,920
it can be a car so anything and there's

949
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,839
an artifact that is produced and

950
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,240
variated in supply chain that you can

951
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,480
create statements about and you issue

952
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,520
them

953
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,359
and the issuing happens

954
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,160
by

955
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,079
signing them and then you're in an

956
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,880
issuer and this is a gun already cozy

957
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,800
stuff so on the left side you're the the

958
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,880
receipt thing you already see some cdl

959
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,079
there that

960
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,480
reveals this is a counter signing thing

961
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,520
so when you have the issued signed claim

962
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,440
you can put a

963
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,920
identity document thing like i did this

964
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,160
in there and then this is a claim claim

965
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,920
might be a bad term let's not talk about

966
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,760
this right now but then you put it to

967
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,000
this transparency service that's the

968
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,160
ledger you might heard a blockchain

969
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
that's not a blockchain it's close to it

970
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,319
but it's an append only ledger and the

971
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,280
important thing is you can trust this

972
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,839
ledger and then when you did the commit

973
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,680
of this transparent claim to your supply

974
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,200
chains everybody wants to know about

975
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,960
this and come back you get a receipt

976
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,400
and the receipt is a counter signing

977
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,960
method about merkle trees that we do and

978
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,119
then it's a transparent claim so now we

979
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,680
have this statement that is the uh

980
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,200
statement about the artifact you have

981
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,119
the claim itself and the received and

982
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,839
now you can offline validate that you

983
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,760
can put trust in the trial in the ledger

984
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,599
and the transparency service and just be

985
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,520
offline and that's an important feature

986
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,040
i think but also you can go back to the

987
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,480
ledger and do the service um audit trail

988
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
back to this because at the bottom left

989
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,319
there's auditors we want to make sure

990
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,040
this all happens did it happen correctly

991
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,640
and so there are a lot of things in the

992
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,720
drafts you can talk about and we have a

993
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,359
special receipt format that helps doing

994
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,400
this so the last slide please

995
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,440
and i'm over i'm so sorry you know it's

996
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,599
related back there's cozy working group

997
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,200
and there's the reds working group cozy

998
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,280
as the received reds working group is

999
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,040
helping the ledger to be actually

1000
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,520
authentic and do authentic things and of

1001
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,760
course this is somehow related to the

1002
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,440
certificate transparency work in rfc

1003
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,440
6962 so all of this is interesting i

1004
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,200
think there's a conglomerate of people

1005
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,359
that would really want to do this and

1006
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,280
more about this at the sac dispatch

1007
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,800
sorry for being

1008
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,520
somehow over

1009
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:07,020
[Applause]

1010
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,720
you and i were exchanging witty repartee

1011
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,960
for about 10 seconds at the beginning so

1012
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,800
you were good you were good

1013
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,599
um and uh have daniel

1014
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,480
as the last speaker

1015
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,720
daniel are you

1016
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,598
in meet echo

1017
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,640
uh i can

1018
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,960
and i'm not going to share that anymore

1019
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,200
and i'm going to share this instead

1020
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,440
and

1021
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,720
okay so

1022
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,839
and you uh you

1023
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,000
should be able to control these now i

1024
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,160
think

1025
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,359
so i

1026
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,280
i can see the first slide but um

1027
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,040
i'm not sure

1028
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,119
oh yeah okay

1029
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,599
it works

1030
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,680
so

1031
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,680
go

1032
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,800
yeah hi everyone so

1033
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,880
i'm going to talk about air flight co2

1034
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,800
emissions um associated to our um itf

1035
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,960
meetings

1036
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,040
so the basic question is

1037
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,599
can the itf continue with business as

1038
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:38,880
usual

1039
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,440
um on the one hand we have uh in-person

1040
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,760
native meetings which involve

1041
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,000
uh around a thousand international

1042
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,520
flights

1043
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,000
and um on the other hand we have science

1044
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,520
that urge us to reduce our co2 emissions

1045
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,839
the ipcc six assessment report are just

1046
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,040
partially being published and um

1047
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,839
already u.n security secretary general

1048
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,040
called it a red code red for humanity

1049
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,960
um the guardian described it as a

1050
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,160
starkest warning yet of major inevitable

1051
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,960
and irreversible climate changes

1052
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,400
so

1053
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,880
the basic question now we need to ask is

1054
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,240
what we should do and what can we do

1055
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,280
um

1056
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,160
so we started to ask ourselves um a

1057
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,480
subset of questions um

1058
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,720
we term such as

1059
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,839
how

1060
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,800
if we apply the ipcc recommendation then

1061
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,040
what would be the impact on the itf if

1062
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,079
so

1063
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,880
um what is exactly the amount of co2

1064
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,520
emitted by um an iit for attending one

1065
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,599
two three meetings a year

1066
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,960
and

1067
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,079
how

1068
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,800
following the trends of sustainable

1069
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,599
aviation would impact the itf

1070
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,240
and last um i mean um

1071
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
should we consider sustainability in a

1072
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,240
broader sense than only the co2

1073
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,079
emissions

1074
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,800
so this is a small studies which we we

1075
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,960
started we have code publications and

1076
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,560
data all available on that website

1077
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,960
we presented that to the

1078
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,119
iab ad workshops in

1079
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,680
november or december i can't remember

1080
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,880
and we will um share that presentation

1081
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,359
again um during the shmu

1082
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,720
session this time during this itf so

1083
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,560
it's basically an invitation for you to

1084
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,960
come and to attend that um presentation

1085
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,480
so

1086
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,560
if we see um

1087
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,520
how the report has been um i mean the ib

1088
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,839
report is currently

1089
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,160
reporting this situation is a

1090
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,640
initial result suggests

1091
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,280
that the cost of um holding multiple

1092
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,000
impersonative meetings per year are

1093
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,400
likely unsustainable although the

1094
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,800
analysis is ongoing so

1095
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,240
um

1096
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,560
actually

1097
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,000
we do have um some um brazil's that are

1098
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,200
not

1099
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,680
that um a little bit more straight

1100
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,200
straighter than um what the report is

1101
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,160
kind of suggesting and um

1102
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,359
what um our conclusions are um

1103
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,839
that uh holding three meeting in-person

1104
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,319
meetings a year is um

1105
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,040
uh unsustainable um

1106
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,280
and uh whatever time whatever path we

1107
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,079
take uh it seems like uh uh limiting it

1108
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,480
to one per year um

1109
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,079
is uh probably

1110
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,440
something uh

1111
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,040
we should aim at

1112
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,599
and that sustainability goes beyond co2

1113
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,280
emissions and that we would like um

1114
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,800
maybe considering adhering to

1115
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,640
sustainability programs so that's

1116
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,480
everything we're going to discuss

1117
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,680
in xmu this week

1118
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,400
thank you

1119
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,800
