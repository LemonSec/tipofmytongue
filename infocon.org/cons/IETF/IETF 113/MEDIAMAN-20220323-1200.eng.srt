1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
so it's now

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,320
12 noon and we have a whole four people

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
in the room

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,320
and uh

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,720
12 people signed in

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,880
to the to the media

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
to the meet ago

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,960
which is about approximately what i

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,560
should expect i think

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,079
so we'll give it one more minute and

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,520
then we'll just start we have

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,640
let me see

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,960
yes muthu here's

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,440

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,599
oh yes

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,440
i was

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,559
seeing if

19
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,920
trying to see if manu is present

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
just checking that we have all the

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,439
present

22
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,158
presenters

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,920
you're in the queue

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,320
but we have

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,479
the only way i can test to make sure i'm

26
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,360
properly connected yeah

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,000
just wave your hand at

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,240
the queue

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
okay

30
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,000
so manny will have to pick up when he

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
arrives

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,320
i must uh

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,719
admit that i have no idea speaking of

34
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,280
pronouns uh whether manu is he or she

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,159
manus pony

36
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,679
the one that got that does the

37
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,959
slides have

38
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,200
me multiple suffixes for media types but

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
i i got

40
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,000
that person shreds

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,440
i mean in this context it's the average

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,280
person is a

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,120
the every person is likely to answer to

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
he but you never know

45
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
yeah

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,920
so let's get started this is the first

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
face-to-face meeting of the

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,760
or

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,040
face to some phases meeting to of the

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,080
media man working group

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,720
we have a

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,120
hopefully administrative task in front

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
of us

54
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,400
in deciding on how the rules should be

55
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,519
to

56
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,760
register top level mime types and

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,519
other

58
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,519
changes to the mime type registration

59
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,239
process of which we have

60
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,800
one specific proposal

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,440
on the table in front of us

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,760
so standard procedure

63
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
if i can find the next slide but

64
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,440
note well

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,239
you're running a meeting under idf

66
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,680
policy if you don't understand

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,920
everything on this slide

68
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,958
yeah work in front of you

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,319
i somehow managed to get the

70
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,680
template without the

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,239
standards for good behavior slide on it

72
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,599
but

73
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,839
i suppose you have seen all this already

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
meeting tips for

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,480
using me meet echo

76
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,599
remote participants

77
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,799
use of a headset is strongly recommended

78
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,920
to reduce the chance of echo

79
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,360
and

80
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
project when you're

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,480
when you need to

82
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,920
some links if you need them

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,358
and here's our agenda

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,240
the general format is your

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
every presenter gets five minutes and

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,759
then they add tenants open for

87
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,759
discussion

88
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,320
and in the end we have

89
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,040
10 minutes for wrap up

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,600
we have one hour from

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,400
four minutes to go

92
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,360
so

93
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,280
any comments on the agenda

94
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,120
seeing nobody on the queue i'll

95
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,960
just hand it over to

96
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,199
martin for

97
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,000
the new top level types documents

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
just say next slide when i supposed to

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,479
get skip

100
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,800
okay thanks help can you hear me

101
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,639
yes okay

102
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,440
so

103
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
next slide

104
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,039
uh the first point i want to get across

105
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,400
is that

106
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,560
our current chart this

107
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,120
currently doesn't say that we have to

108
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,440
create such a document but

109
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
we have to determine whether

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,919
we

111
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,199
need such a document so keep that in

112
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,720
mind

113
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,759
okay

114
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,880
next

115
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,680
slide

116
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
well

117
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,759
after harold twisted my arm and got me

118
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,199
to become an editor for this draft

119
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,680
i just thought i would kind of go

120
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,039
through

121
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,400
and

122
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,440
find all the documents that actually

123
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,280
do define top level media types

124
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,759
and here's what i found

125
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
rc 20 7070 is not mentioned in the

126
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,680
current draft but um

127
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
alex malikov sent me a mail

128
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
and told me that that was the number

129
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,639
that i needed

130
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,000
there's also

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
first of april

132
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
one

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,520
and there's the haptics top level

134
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,960
uh proposal that we'll discuss later

135
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,000
and then also i found a chemical top

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,120
level type that is

137
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,080
not officially adjusted and it has a lot

138
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,720
of x hyphen types

139
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,240
subtypes

140
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,840
in it so these are just

141
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,080
the examples that we can look at

142
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,680
and think about what cat here that we

143
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
want to

144
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,759
define if we indeed want to

145
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,199
define them

146
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,919
okay next slide

147
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,479
the

148
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,319
basic

149
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,759
the the base that we are working from is

150
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,280
rfc 6838

151
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,360
which is media type specifications and

152
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,919
the administrations and the

153
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,639
pieces that are relevant for this work

154
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,680
are

155
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,720
section

156
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,639
4.2.5 and

157
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,000
4.2.7 and in particularly the

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,160
bolded

159
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
pieces

160
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,400
application media types can be used for

161
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
anything that doesn't fit under any

162
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,960
other types

163
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,639
and types always means top level types

164
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,000
actually

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,879
and the

166
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
additional top level types

167
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
should be quite rare and they can be

168
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,199
defined via standard stack

169
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,720
rfc

170
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
so the question is whether we need

171
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,639
anything more than

172
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,520
than what we have already in this

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,039
rfc

174
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,599
next slide

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,680
uh

176
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
this is mostly

177
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
well

178
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
kind of putting section three of my

179
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
draft on a slide

180
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,039
this is just a collection of potential

181
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,440
criteria that we could actually

182
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,799
use

183
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,320
uh

184
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,958
well one thing is that each

185
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,679
new level top level type should be air

186
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
and therefore each

187
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,360
probably needs separate consideration

188
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,839
and

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,080
if there are a lot of types actually in

190
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,120
the wild that was the case for font and

191
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
this is the case now for a fan chemical

192
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,920
that might be an indication

193
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,720
of the need to actually formally define

194
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,040
that top level type

195
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
and also

196
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,519
on the other hand undefined top level

197
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,440
types should be highly discouraged yeah

198
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,480
and

199
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,040
so these two the last two points are a

200
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
little bit in

201
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,640
uh

202
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,920
contest to each other next slide

203
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,640
just uh i forgot one important thing

204
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,080
betty can you take notes

205
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,600
robert robert stefanik takes notes

206
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
thanks a lot just make sure you if we

207
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,680
decide on the thing that you get get it

208
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,160
into the notes

209
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,040
okay

210
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,800
let's go on

211
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
okay

212
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,760
then this lists the formal criteria

213
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,880
which

214
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,839
standard stack rfc we probably want to

215
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,920
keep that but we can of course discuss

216
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
that

217
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,399
uh we need clear criteria for what

218
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,720
belongs in the new top level type and

219
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
whatnot

220
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
and

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,120
we need some initial registrations if

222
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,839
there's just an idea for a new type if i

223
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,440
know actual

224
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,720
uh

225
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,760
actual types there

226
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,560
that's probably not gonna work

227
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
uh in

228
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,519
some document i so i mentioned of common

229
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,399
parameters that might be a plus for a

230
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,279
new

231
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,360
top model type

232
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,399
and also the question is whether or not

233
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,680
to use a

234
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,079
working group to define a top level type

235
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,959
and i think we should leave that open

236
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,040
because we have seen in the past both

237
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,199
examples okay next slide

238
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,720
in terms of content

239
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,560
these are some

240
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,160
questions on the previous slide

241
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,480
okay so this is barry lieber um can you

242
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
flip the slide back carl

243
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,760
thank you the um

244
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,040
i want to just want to make sure we

245
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,959
don't just do that first bullet

246
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
standards track rfc without thinking

247
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
about it

248
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
as long as we're changing the rules for

249
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,640
this we might consider

250
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
whether having standards whether having

251
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,600
new top level types go through the

252
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,320
expert reviewer rather than having to

253
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,880
have standards track rfc

254
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,640
uh we may decide we want to keep the

255
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,440
standards track rfc path but

256
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,640
i just want to make sure we don't just

257
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,160
blow that off

258
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
out of hand

259
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,399
alexei do you have a thought on that as

260
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,200
one of the reviewers

261
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,399
sorry i need to log in and add my myself

262
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,760
to the queue but um so uh

263
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,519
yeah i would rather keep it standard

264
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,600
track it it should be high enough bar

265
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,839
they are so rare

266
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,320
um

267
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,440
yeah

268
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,160
so

269
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
let's uh let's try to to take the

270
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
discussion after the full presentation

271
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,480
yeah so fine

272
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,959
i just set a

273
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,839
back to the schedule sorry about

274
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,399
okay on this slide i put a few

275
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,240
uh points that they found in previous

276
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,120
definitions of top level types these

277
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
previous definitions like the font like

278
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
the model type and so on

279
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,959
they have to kind of

280
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
advertise they have to

281
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
advocate for this new type and they

282
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,000
bring forward various

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,519
uh

284
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,839
criteria

285
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,639
one thing that is that definitely well

286
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,360
we have audio we have image we have

287
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,240
video and so we might in the future have

288
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,320
something all factory but although the

289
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,399
technology for that is maybe not ready

290
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,920
yet

291
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,880
uh also whether

292
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,079
some types have a temporal aspect or not

293
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,560
or a spatial aspect

294
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,920
it can affect that

295
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,720
also

296
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,360
whether it's easy to convert

297
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
within a type

298
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,600
a top level type then between top level

299
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,160
types for example it's easier to con

300
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,320
convert an audio format to an audio

301
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
format

302
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,880
than to an image and so on

303
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,120
and

304
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,839
also the practice or need for dispatch

305
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,800
on top level types

306
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,399
and the existence of actual subtypes of

307
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,639
potential subtypes might be

308
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,120
criteria and then of course type

309
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,680
specific criteria but

310
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,920
it's really these things are yeah and so

311
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,560
we can find criteria like the ones i

312
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,880
have listed but we always have to be

313
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,160
open for

314
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,959
new stuff i think okay next slide

315
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,000
iana considerations uh

316
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
what i discovered is that there is

317
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,199
currently no registry for top level

318
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,639
types there is a registry for

319
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,839
subtypes that is organized by top level

320
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,519
types but

321
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,040
the documentation varies for example

322
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,519
you can find that there is a model top

323
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,600
level type but you

324
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,560
it's

325
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,800
not possible from the industry to find

326
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,920
where this is defined yeah

327
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,040
so

328
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,079
maybe we have to

329
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,760
tell iona to organize this a slightly

330
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,240
tiny little bit better

331
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,760
uh

332
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
at least have the type name and the

333
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,000
defining rfc

334
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,320
maybe some other

335
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,279
um

336
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,560
things

337
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,599
okay next slide

338
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,480
okay these are mostly notes to myself

339
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,079
in

340
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,959
most cases

341
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,560
uh

342
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,040
the documents speak about type and

343
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
subtype whereas

344
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,600
it's easier to say top level type to

345
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,360
make it clear

346
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
also the questions where the top level

347
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
should be with five now without and so

348
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,040
on

349
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,920
uh but that's that's really details

350
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,880
okay next slide

351
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,040
okay and that's hull slide that's

352
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
actually not my slide so back to harold

353
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,759
thank you

354
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,680
thanks for the introduction

355
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,160
so now

356
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
the question of in front of the working

357
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,880
group that we have to decide by the

358
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
have to have to have an idea by the end

359
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
of the segment is to

360
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,279
whether to adopt this or not

361
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,519
as a working group drafts

362
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,680
and

363
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,639
the content is of course subject to this

364
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,399
discussion on all the individual points

365
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,800
given and formats and

366
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,120
formulations and all all everything that

367
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
we do when we

368
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,440
get a proper review of any draft

369
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,950
but

370
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,079
[Music]

371
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,320
the flow's open barry you're first on

372
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,639
the queue

373
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,160
okay this is barry lieber first i'll um

374
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,320
go to the the last point of uh do we

375
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,440
need a media type registry we do have it

376
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,360
uh at the beginning of the media types

377
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
registry there's a section that lists

378
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,800
the

379
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,240
the sub registries for each media type

380
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
for each top level type so we actually

381
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,160
do have that in the registry i think

382
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,560
that's that point is not necessary to

383
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,959
address at all

384
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,319
and so i want to get back to the

385
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,759
i think there is actually a minor subtle

386
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,319
issue that it is in the registry but

387
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,079
that's what ayanna created there is

388
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
actually no creation of the top level

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,039
registry so i think um

390
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,919
martin's point about that uh

391
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,079
knowing rfc is defining top-level types

392
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,280
is sometimes tricky it's very true i

393
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,760
actually i did find model for him and i

394
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,240
emailed him but it's like

395
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,160
this is because i already spent half an

396
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,600
hour searching for it last time

397
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,559
i think all we may need to do is put a

398
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,720
reference at that at the beginning here

399
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,000
that has

400
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,080
the rfc for each

401
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,919
level

402
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,679
and reference

403
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,919
yeah yes i i think the question of

404
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,919
whether there is a registry and we need

405
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,240
to add something or whether we need to

406
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,080
create the agency with the things that

407
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,520
we want that's really a

408
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
semantic question that doesn't really

409
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,200
make any difference

410
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,400
right it's a small issue yeah so the

411
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
other one is that what i brought up

412
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,799
before the my reason for

413
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,520
saying we should think about at least

414
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,600
is i'm looking at chemical

415
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,400
as as a thing that's it's not anything

416
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,240
we have any expertise over whether that

417
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,400
should be a top level registry or not

418
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,640
the i the ietf

419
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,559
participants in general

420
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,120
are not really steeped in

421
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
whether a new media type should be

422
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,640
created it's the experts you ned murray

423
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,400
who are the ones who really have a sense

424
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,360
of that

425
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,440
and basically the ietf is going to do

426
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,280
whatever you suggest

427
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,919
so why not just skip the whole

428
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,559
standards track thing and and let that

429
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,880
go through the media types experts as

430
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,919
well

431
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,840
and i'm ambivalent i can go either way

432
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,039
i'm just bringing up the issue

433
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,600
uh with my

434
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,320
yeah alex a alexey with media my media

435
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,840
type expert hat on

436
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,200
sometimes experts need help

437
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,080
so i don't mind considering the question

438
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,559
of registration procedure that is fine a

439
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,039
possible tweak on it might be

440
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,000
um

441
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,480
specification required as in expert

442
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,600
review

443
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,679
specification needs to be written

444
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,320
doesn't have to be atf specification

445
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,720
but maybe with an escape clause saying

446
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,600
that

447
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,918
experts can request itf review

448
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,880
i think i think that that that would be

449
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,960
sensible

450
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,200
but

451
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
coming back to the question about

452
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,000
document adoption i think we should

453
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
it's quite clear there are lots of open

454
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
issues and things that are not

455
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,200
you know yet to be resolved but i think

456
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,240
well martin did better job than any

457
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,039
anybody else of us so he has a document

458
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,799
so i think we should adopt it

459
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,120
um

460
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,640
let's see

461
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,840
one

462
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,159
more random comment about possible

463
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,480
criteria for the top level media types

464
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,880
might be

465
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
if all subtypes have a shared

466
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,679
property or restriction

467
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,679
and i actually can give examples like

468
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,960
for text

469
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,159
uh

470
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,240
for all text uh

471
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
media types

472
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,159
they all have to be

473
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,080
crlf

474
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,440
uh each line is here left so if your

475
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
chair certain coding doesn't allow for

476
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,000
that

477
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,159
it cannot be text media type

478
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,080
that's a restriction that is common for

479
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,200
all of them

480
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,000
take start here

481
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,799
i think it still applies to that

482
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,840
the like the uh thunderbird used to to

483
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
support uh

484
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,520
um utf-16 variants

485
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,760
for text and i think they took it out

486
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
because probably they were told that you

487
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,880
cannot do that

488
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,360
um i'm closing the queue after

489
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,919
after alex i finished but finishes by

490
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,520
the way um

491
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,640
and similar like uh

492
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
multipart has certain restrictions about

493
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,320
what can be inside it how it's formatted

494
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,760
so again if if there is a set of

495
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,120
related things they have common

496
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,799
properties or common restrictions that

497
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,440
might be a criteria for

498
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,600
top level

499
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,520
okay

500
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,240
uh fail

501
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,039
keep it short

502
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,559
so yes we should have dropped the draft

503
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,400
uh the principle that i think that we

504
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,559
need to adopt here is

505
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,120
permissionless innovation so that

506
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,840
anybody can get access to register any

507
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,200
media type

508
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
without

509
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
having to kiss rings

510
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,880
but that only applies to the

511
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,000
actual registration itself

512
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,320
when we're looking at the top level

513
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,840
concerns

514
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
that's a matter of organization of the

515
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,880
registry it isn't a gating

516
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
function and so i think that it's

517
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,360
entirely right and proper to have

518
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,760
standards track required

519
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,600
uh to reorganize for organization

520
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,480
so long as you don't have to kiss rings

521
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,840
to get registration

522
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,600
thank you john

523
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,880
i'm speaking with my non-existent hack

524
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,840
as the author of uh as co-author of one

525
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,159
of the relevant documents here

526
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,280
um

527
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,760
it's been cleared in discussions and

528
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
other topics

529
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,840
in the last few weeks

530
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,880
that uh that probably there is a problem

531
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,679
with the standards track categorization

532
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,320
and and and

533
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,559
the next step there

534
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,960
um which is that putting requiring

535
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,559
something beyond standards track

536
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,280
actually involves two separate things

537
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,080
one of them is that the

538
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
isg after listening to the type of

539
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,640
viewers and uh and waving its hands and

540
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,480
running a last call which often gets no

541
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,760
response

542
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,559
um

543
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,720
order having blessed something

544
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,960
uh but the other is that it provides an

545
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,600
opportunity for community input and

546
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,240
responsibility input and discussion

547
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,520
uh the media type reviewers are

548
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,360
wonderful people they have done a great

549
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,440
job but they are not experts in all

550
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,960
possible fields which might be covered

551
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,799
by top level types

552
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,039
and forcing the opportunity for a

553
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,440
community discussion on those things if

554
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,360
only to inform them but under the

555
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,760
current procedures there's no way to do

556
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,919
that so it's informed the isg

557
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,159
is is actually a valuable contribution

558
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,440
to this

559
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,720
process so until and unless we revise

560
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,600
the categories of approval for

561
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,279
um for

562
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,520
top level categories approval for any

563
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,039
iana register

564
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,400
uh we're better off leading the top

565
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,159
level types as uh as standards track

566
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,880
even if the ia even if the isbx is a

567
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
little bit pro-forma

568
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,799
thanks

569
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,120
thank you

570
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,240
i also support standards track for most

571
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,679
of the reasons given i think john said

572
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,200
more elegantly than what i was about to

573
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,039
say which is as a media type reviewer

574
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,039
for something big like this i would

575
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,200
prefer the air cover of you know making

576
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
sure that i'm not making a mistake by

577
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,559
approving a top level type

578
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,960
so um i and i also support adoption of

579
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,159
the document thank you martin for

580
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,880
putting it together

581
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,880
thank you we're at the end of the queue

582
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
and

583
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
phil what

584
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,679
phil do you feel strong need to have a

585
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,919
last remark

586
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,440
oh drop out

587
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,320
so

588
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,760
i'm hearing

589
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,200
consensus for adopting the document

590
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,799
i'm hearing a strong propo preponderance

591
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,919
of speakers who

592
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,840
are in favor of

593
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,320
using standards track for

594
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,120
as a getting criterion for new tuple

595
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,720
types

596
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,159
and

597
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,679
i don't think there's any reason to run

598
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,159
a poll on this we should uh confirm it

599
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,840
on the list but

600
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,400
let's do let let's uh assume that let's

601
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,840
just throw in that i'm good with that

602
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,360
decision i just wanted to make sure we

603
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,919
discussed it yep

604
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,679
okay

605
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,840
so

606
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,880
we have now

607
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,039
the driving example of uh

608
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,039
muthusami's

609
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,840
haptics drafts

610
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,080
the first candidate to be processed

611
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,279

612
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,279

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,000
thanks harold uh good morning good

650
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,080
afternoon good evening everybody my name

651
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,439
is yeshwanth muthusami

652
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,559
so what has happened since the last time

653
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,279
i i was since the time that i uploaded

654
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,760
version zero zero of the media uh man

655
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,720
draft

656
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,080
for haptics in mpeg the

657
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,039
iso bmf's seventh edition was approved

658
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:29,760
and

659
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,000
and published in january of

660
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,799
2022 and that is significant because in

661
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,520
that we specify haptic tracks as a

662
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,840
top-level media track at the same level

663
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,919
as audio and video

664
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,679
and in mpeg the haptics phase one

665
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,399
codex standard is making good progress

666
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,240
towards his first ballot which is

667
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,679
expected in uh in october of of 2022.

668
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,640
uh in mpegi which is in immersive media

669
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,880
scene description the haptics phase two

670
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
use cases and requirements have been

671
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,120
approved these are those which pertain

672
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,000
to xr and avatars and interactivity and

673
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,240
work is underway to define the three

674
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,880
haptics related extensions to gltf which

675
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,279
is a framework used in scene description

676
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,640
uh just an

677
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,320
update on what has happened since i

678
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,039
uploaded the medium and haptics draft

679
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,760
and in ietf itself thanks to

680
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,240
martin we just went through the top

681
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,880
level draft and from our reading we

682
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,640
believe that the haptics in internet

683
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,399
draft does indeed satisfy all the all

684
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,760
the criterion

685
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,799
all the criteria that were listed in in

686
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,039
section three and in the in the rest of

687
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,039
this presentation i'm going to be

688
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,960
going into a little bit

689
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,559
deeper into how the draft that

690
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,240
does do that so

691
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,440
with that

692
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,159
just a quick recap of the basics since i

693
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,320
haven't seen much traffic on the haptics

694
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,360
draft on the media types list it haptics

695
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,600
refers to the generation of

696
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,360
touch related

697
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,919
sensations in a device or interface it's

698
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,559
widely used in a variety of consumer

699
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,679
devices to provide touch feedback and

700
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,240
the haptic technologies require some

701
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,640
form of activation to create a tactile

702
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,440
sensation in smaller devices like mobile

703
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,600
phones or controllers these are

704
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,360
typically small vibrating motors if you

705
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,640
go to large

706
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,080
automotive

707
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,919
touch screens the actuators as

708
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,039
specialized pso electric materials and

709
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,760
haptic capabilities are now part of

710
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,120
every modern

711
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,760
smartphone gaming and vr controller the

712
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,799
most pro

713
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,760
prominent of which is the sony ps5 dual

714
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,440
sense controller

715
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,640
okay

716
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,440
so

717
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,919
going right down into the the the

718
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,039
criteria that martin had had listed uh

719
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,240
so i had i i i list each criteria and

720
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,840
the parts in blue

721
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,399
is our response or our understanding of

722
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,720
how the haptics internet draft does

723
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,600
indeed meet those meet that criterion so

724
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,840
the two new new top level types are rare

725
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
enough and different enough that each

726
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,679
application needs to be well evaluated

727
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,000
separately we believe that the haptic

728
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,799
structure top level type is unlike any

729
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,480
of the top level types that are

730
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,120
currently uh currently recognized by

731
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,000
ietf and it does it is different enough

732
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,039
to to merit top level status for all the

733
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,600
reasons that we mention in our draft

734
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,559
and

735
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,000
it needs to be

736
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,360
documented in a standard track rfc and

737
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,679
that is indeed the intended status of

738
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,399
our draft uh it should include initial

739
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,640
registrations of the actual types as

740
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,200
soon as our draft is approved uh we do

741
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,559
plan to it will be blue plan to register

742
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,880
the actual types which are currently

743
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,000
defined in the in the draft and may or

744
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,760
may not need a working group well we are

745
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,120
talking about it right now in this

746
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,320
working group

747
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,360
uh

748
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,159
so uh the existence of a certain number

749
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,240
of subtypes would be

750
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,559
grouped under the new top level type

751
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,799
at a minimum at least one success

752
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,200
subtype should exist but the existence

753
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,960
of one test subtype is not enough uh we

754
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,519
none of these subtypes that you see here

755
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,679
have actually been

756
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,760
been registered yet i just want to make

757
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,159
that clear but they have been described

758
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,720
in the in section in in section 2.5 of

759
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,039
the haptics draft for example we talk

760
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,080
about these potential subtypes which are

761
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
actually

762
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,640
very widely in use right now for example

763
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,440
a hap is the standard encoding on all

764
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,600
ios devices and ios connected

765
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,440
game peripherals

766
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,600
org is a proprietary extension to the

767
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,480
arc format to store haptic media that

768
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,120
made its debut in android 11.

769
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,760
ibs is an xml-based vendor-specific for

770
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,720
format that's used in many mobile phones

771
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,000
from lg and gaming phones from asus and

772
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,240
hacked is also a vendor-specific format

773
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,480
that's using mobile haptic

774
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,519
advertising and certain japanese games

775
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,720
in addition in section 2.6 of our draft

776
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,519
we

777
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,080
we envision in a number of haptic

778
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,240
subtypes as part of the various haptic

779
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,039
standards which are in various 10

780
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,000
various stages of standardization uh the

781
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,559
hmpg which would be the mpeg haptics

782
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,279
phase one coca-cola standard which is

783
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,679
which i as i mentioned is likely to go

784
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,000
into see into cd ballot in october of

785
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,600
this year the h-i-e-e which is the ieee

786
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,919
p1918.1.1

787
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,399
vipro tactile coco coding standard that

788
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,200
is that is currently under ieee sa by

789
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,320
ballot and then the last two are are

790
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,600
subtypes that we are planning to

791
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
register which is

792
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,840
based on in in

793
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,919
numerated effects haptic

794
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,559
coding format that's based on midi and

795
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,360
the

796
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,600
audio to vibe haptic

797
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,480
coding format so there are a number of

798
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,000
existing haptic

799
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,879
subtypes which can be registered under

800
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,879
this new type

801
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,118
sorry let me go to the next slide

802
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,879
just making sure okay up the i seem to

803
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,480
have mr space

804
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,520
page sorry about that okay now existing

805
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,399
use of a undefined top level type might

806
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,159
be indication of a need but then of

807
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,639
course views of undefined top-level

808
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,280
types is highly discouraged no undefined

809
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,679
top-level haptic types are are currently

810
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,800
in use as far as as far as we can tell

811
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,679
uh

812
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,839
top level types mostly help humans it is

813
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,760
unclear to what extent level types can

814
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,119
be used by applications as used and and

815
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,639
therefore

816
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,719
evaluating how a new not

817
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,159
top level type

818
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,640
uh helps humans understand types may be

819
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,359
crucial the only point we want to make

820
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,560
here is that the proposed haptic

821
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,160
top level type pertains to the human

822
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,560
sense of touch just as the existing

823
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,200
audio video top level types pertain to

824
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,000
the senses of hearing and and vision

825
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,359
respectively

826
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,920
uh moving on to the next one which i

827
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,560
believe is mine

828
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,040
do i go on or do i wait for mountain

829
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,280
i don't want to interrupt

830
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,240
okay

831
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,760
okay you'll you're first thank you

832
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,160
all right i'm almost done here so uh

833
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,359
need for clear criteria for what types

834
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,359
do and don't fall under the new

835
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,240
top level type uh any subtype that deals

836
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,160
with one of the haptic submodalities

837
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,000
which uh which which are described in

838
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,640
the draft which is vibrotactile

839
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,359
kinesthetic spatial surface of the

840
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,920
thermal haptics is a clear candidate for

841
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,000
inclusion under the haptic top level

842
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,400
type as far as the

843
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,920
desirability for

844
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,880
common

845
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,400
parameters is concerned uh all data

846
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,079
formats which are

847
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,920
in the haptics id which put into the

848
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,760
sense of touch would need to be under

849
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,359
the proposed uh tactics top level type

850
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,079
and another feature that is common to

851
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,599
all of these haptic

852
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,400
subtypes is that they all would require

853
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,720
a haptic subsystem such as low level

854
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,520
haptics apis which in turn would require

855
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,680
hardware capabilities such as one or

856
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
more actuators in the device as i

857
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,079
mentioned earlier to actually render the

858
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,960
haptics media so those are the common

859
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,280
features you look for when you are

860
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,800
trying to make a

861
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,119
decision

862
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,960
with that that

863
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,320
brings me to the end of my main

864
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,640
presentation if you notice on the slides

865
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,599
i have a whole bunch of uh backup slides

866
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,520
which are meant for the audience to go

867
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,359
through or

868
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,520
go over on their own time but i included

869
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,800
them because of the relative uh

870
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,960
no

871
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,079
level type and but i'm happy to take any

872
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,040
questions at this point

873
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,079
okay

874
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,520
martin you're first on the queue

875
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,839
yes

876
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:27,280
uh thanks for yeshwanth to uh

877
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,200
kind of compare

878
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,480
his new type with my criteria but i

879
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,040
think i just wanted to say we have to be

880
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,400
careful

881
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,000
to know

882
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,119
uh

883
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,920
who is the dog and who is the tail

884
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,880
i mean

885
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,280
my draft isn't

886
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,599
even yet a

887
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,400
working group draft and i'm not claiming

888
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,240
that my criteria are complete or they

889
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,119
are

890
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,359
any of them are necessary

891
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,520
so

892
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,320
we we have to be careful if for example

893
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,520
if you type there's some cat here that

894
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,920
we find that can help

895
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,200
or that you you don't qualify then we

896
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,760
have to look at the criteria maybe fix

897
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,800
them

898
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,440
anyway i just wanted to

899
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,720
say that we have to

900
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,839
it's not that i'm going to define the

901
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,000
criteria and you just have to follow

902
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,359
it's actually

903
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,480
maybe the other way around also

904
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,800
sure

905
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,839
if i might

906
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,000
quickly respond i mean

907
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,240
your point is well taken my martin but

908
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,079
this is all i had to go this is all i

909
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,680
had to go by

910
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,400
and it also helped that your draft

911
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,280
preceded mine in the in

912
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,359
the presentation sequence so i was

913
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,960
taking advantage of that

914
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,400
but but your point is taken

915
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,520
thank you phil

916
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,280
yeah um

917
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,400
taking a point that john made uh

918
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,320
in the last discussion

919
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,240
and applying it here

920
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,480
it occurs to me that

921
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,119
uh one of the very useful areas for

922
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,880
having reasons for having different top

923
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,320
level types is going to be

924
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,119
the ads may want to

925
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,839
assign different experts according to

926
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,680
top level type

927
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,000
and that is likely to be exceptionally

928
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,119
useful

929
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,119
in a case like this

930
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,960
where you've got

931
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,040
uh you know the whole haptic field is

932
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,880
going to be something that needs quite a

933
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
bit of expertise

934
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,160
if you're going to avoid ambiguity

935
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,599
or multiple issues of

936
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,599
you know issue of multiple code points

937
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,560
to the same specification or whatever

938
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,680
and so uh yeah i i think that this is

939
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,800
definitely along the right lines it

940
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,720
definitely needs a separate top level

941
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
type because

942
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,320
this is not

943
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,599
it's not like application where

944
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,359
everything's different and you're never

945
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,760
going to get coherence

946
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,599
it's not like anything we've done before

947
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,720
and

948
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,200
you're going to need expertise to

949
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,079
understand this is a rapidly changing

950
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,040
environment and a moving target

951
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,520
and so moving into your own thing does

952
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,319
make sense to me

953
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,240
thank you phil murray

954
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,280
um just responding to martin quickly i

955
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,560
think we have an advantageous

956
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,319
situation here where

957
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,800
we're defining both the

958
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
the standards track document that's

959
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,839
going to explain how you create a top

960
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,520
level type and then a first case coming

961
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,960
along with it developing them in

962
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,480
parallel and shipping them both to the

963
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,440
isg at the same time is perfectly fine

964
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,040
and i think that i think the two moving

965
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,240
the two of them together is going to

966
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,879
work pretty well

967
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,599
john

968
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,000
yeah i i want to be careful that we

969
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,880
don't invent too much procedure here

970
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,720
because it just gets in the way it slows

971
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,079
things down

972
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,400
um

973
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,680
so

974
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,480
so two observations one of which is that

975
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,760
we'd have to ask the current set of

976
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,599
reviewers

977
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,400
uh

978
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,040
but my guess is based upon when i was

979
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,480
actually actually involved in the

980
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
reviewer process

981
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,440
that uh

982
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,000
that decisions who gets to review which

983
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,480
application are partially based on who

984
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,240
knows something about it

985
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,119
um and uh and if that's not true we

986
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,480
could go off and formalize it but i

987
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,560
don't think would accomplish anything

988
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,920
it does imply something which has gotten

989
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,200
involved in the

990
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,560
uh pre-working group haptics discussion

991
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,079
uh and is consistent with what phil said

992
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,160
uh which is that implicitly the

993
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,480
requirement for a new top level type is

994
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,119
we figure out who reviews it

995
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,760
and uh and if that means tuning the

996
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,599
reviewer process

997
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,359
uh that's fine

998
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,760
uh if that means that we may have to add

999
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,480
a review of each top level type that's

1000
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,440
fine

1001
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,599
but i don't know that we need to tie

1002
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,680
ourselves up and do procedures for this

1003
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,280
or maybe we do

1004
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,359
thanks

1005
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,839
thanks i think i think that the

1006
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,839
the problem

1007
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,000
of whether or not to allow for multiple

1008
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,880
reviews actually comes back to the

1009
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,119
top level type discussion and no

1010
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,800
actually it doesn't it

1011
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,520
it comes to a lit another point which is

1012
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,200
the

1013
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,599
possible redesign of the registration

1014
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,920
procedures for subtypes because after

1015
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,200
all reviewers is part of the subtype

1016
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,770
okay i think we have

1017
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,200
[Music]

1018
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,200
um

1019
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,200
i think we have exhausted this topic for

1020
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
the moment

1021
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,480
and we seem to have found no new reasons

1022
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,839
why this why haptics is a bad idea

1023
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,119
so and uh

1024
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,800
some some compelling arguments for why

1025
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,720
it's a good idea

1026
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,680
so we'll just have to

1027
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,079
wait a little bit until we get the

1028
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,240
rest of the stuff

1029
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,000
fixed up so that we can actually move

1030
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,119
those documents forward

1031
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,480
i'll then

1032
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,160
pass the sh pass the token again to manu

1033
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,400
hi harold can you hear my audio

1034
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,000
i can hear your audience

1035
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,560
wonderful um hello everyone my name is

1036
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,000
manu sporney um i'm the editor of a

1037
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,680
couple of specifications over at the w3c

1038
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,640
uh jason ld decentralized identifiers

1039
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,800
and verifiable credentials

1040
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,680
and that work kind of spawned the need

1041
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,800
for the media man suffixes

1042
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,400
work

1043
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,680
really quickly

1044
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,760
going to cover today

1045
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,480
some of the goals for mediaman suffixes

1046
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,599
uh the changes made since the last time

1047
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,960
we met um some uh topics of concern that

1048
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,040
have come up in the past a couple of

1049
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,880
months since december

1050
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,760
and then see what the group feels are

1051
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,280
the appropriate

1052
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,800
next steps

1053
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,599
next slide please

1054
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,480
okay so what are the goals here um

1055
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,800
we're trying to establish

1056
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,319
how multiple media type suffixes

1057
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,240
should be processed so if you get a if

1058
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,200
you get

1059
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,520
a message with a

1060
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,400
media type with multiple suffixes

1061
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,240
uh what should you be able to do with

1062
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,160
that um so this

1063
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,000
uh you know question was brought up by

1064
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,520
media types like image slash svg plus

1065
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,680
xml plus gzip

1066
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,760
um in application slash did plus ld plus

1067
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,480
json uh anything that has multiple plus

1068
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,400
signs in it

1069
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,560
when we went to register these media

1070
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,599
types

1071
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,560
um

1072
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,800
the ones with multiple plus signs

1073
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,720
the registration

1074
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,480
folks processing the registration were

1075
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,440
like

1076
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,839
well what exactly does that mean right

1077
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,599
so that's what we're trying to

1078
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,040
answer with

1079
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,760
this document

1080
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,000
we're trying to establish registration

1081
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,920
policies for media types with multiple

1082
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,319
suffixes that's the that's the problem

1083
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,119
that

1084
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,040
the verifiable credentials working group

1085
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,280
at w3c hit when they tried to register

1086
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,200
or they were thinking of registering you

1087
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,960
know their media type with multiple plus

1088
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,760
signs same thing with the decentralized

1089
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,520
identifier working group

1090
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,800
um

1091
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,640
in in it looks like we're we're just

1092
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,400
getting more media types that have

1093
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,400
multiple suffixes in them

1094
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,280
um

1095
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,960
we also want to provide some security

1096
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,079
considerations uh when when processing

1097
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,960
uh media types with multiple suffixes

1098
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,040
um and i'll get into that here in a bit

1099
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,800
um but these are i think the the high

1100
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,359
level goals that i heard the working

1101
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,440
group said that they were interested in

1102
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,079
establishing in this draft uh next slide

1103
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,560
please

1104
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,280
okay so what changes have we made since

1105
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,599
the last time you met

1106
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,599
the old processing model in the draft

1107
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,040
that was submitted to the working group

1108
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,280
was just broken

1109
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,000
it worked for things in application

1110
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,200
slash

1111
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,160
but it did not work for image slash svg

1112
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,240
plus xml plus gzip so

1113
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,560
the pros has been rewritten uh we've

1114
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,520
added a few examples to demonstrate um

1115
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,760
what the uh how

1116
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,000
you should think about processing media

1117
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,880
types multiple suffixes

1118
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,920
and the new pros basically

1119
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,760
i believe works with all of the media

1120
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,800
types

1121
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,800
multiple suffix media types that are

1122
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,960
under consideration

1123
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,440
today

1124
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,960
third

1125
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,560
change that was made is there was a

1126
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,119
structured syntaxes suffixes registry

1127
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,119
this is not my area of expertise and i

1128
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,599
had no idea that registry existed

1129
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,319
but the fact that that registry exists

1130
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,400
is really useful

1131
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,440
and

1132
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,400
that

1133
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,240
the existence of that registry and using

1134
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,559
it to do processing has been

1135
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,040
included in the the latest draft

1136
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,920
and finally a security consideration

1137
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,599
section has been uh added because

1138
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,200
there's at least

1139
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,599
one attack that we've identified that

1140
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,280
people need to be aware of when they

1141
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,040
build tooling

1142
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,880
that processes media types multiple

1143
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,319
suffixes

1144
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,119
next slide please

1145
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,920
okay so what are the current topics of

1146
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,240
concern this is really what we need

1147
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,880
feedback on from the working group

1148
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,640
and participants

1149
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,200
there still hasn't been enough review um

1150
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,240
and i'm struggling to figure out how to

1151
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,720
get that review i know that people have

1152
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,480
said things in the past

1153
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,720
uh and they haven't spoken up recently

1154
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,960
so i'm thinking of just like trying to

1155
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,280
get them on the phone and talking

1156
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,040
through the draft with them

1157
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,880
um

1158
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,720
i think it'd be good to

1159
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,760
engage folks like ned because he did

1160
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,240
write the multiple suffixes registry

1161
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,680
thing i don't think he's provided

1162
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,960
feedback yet

1163
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,559
um

1164
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,880
you know other people have done uh

1165
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,119
reviews uh so

1166
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,720
um uh thank you to murray and and uh

1167
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,040
others that have provided input

1168
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,400
but but i'm wondering if we should be

1169
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,240
more targeted and i should just go after

1170
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,760
people that

1171
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,400
should have uh opinions about this uh

1172
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,359
people that have written drafts uh in in

1173
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,760
this particular orbit um the other

1174
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,520
question i have is i don't know if the

1175
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
new processing model is correct i don't

1176
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,760
know if it matches other people's mental

1177
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,400
model and um would really appreciate

1178
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,119
some feedback on that

1179
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,640
there's a link to the new processing

1180
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,040
model from the slides there and then

1181
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,880
finally there's this new security

1182
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,640
consideration section one of the one of

1183
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,720
the things people were concerned about

1184
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,319
was this

1185
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,200
concept of what happens if

1186
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,920
um someone sending you the media type

1187
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,640
lies to you on purpose to try and trick

1188
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,079
your tool chain

1189
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,960
into doing something weird like um

1190
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,640
bypassing uh some kind of uh security

1191
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,319
scanning process

1192
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,079
um by

1193
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,400
un-g-zipping something and then sending

1194
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,079
the resulting

1195
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,720
value directly to an application instead

1196
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,119
of sending it through um

1197
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:43,920
uh

1198
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,000
like a a virus checker or something like

1199
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,440
that um i'm grasping at straws for that

1200
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,200
attack um but i'm trying to

1201
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,720
establish that

1202
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,040
people need to think about that

1203
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,319
harold you also raised

1204
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,040
another i think maybe another attack in

1205
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,400
an email

1206
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,000
but when i went to write it up i got

1207
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,839
confused about whether or not you were

1208
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,280
talking about the media type fibbing

1209
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,599
attack or if there was another one so

1210
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,280
i'd appreciate some feedback um on

1211
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,599
other security considerations other ways

1212
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,160
that that things can go wrong

1213
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,839
um with uh uh processing uh multiple uh

1214
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:26,720
suffixes

1215
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,359
okay so those are the topics of concern

1216
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,119
would appreciate some feedback on each

1217
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,280
one of those items during discussion

1218
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,839
next slide

1219
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,680
okay so what are the next steps

1220
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,800
concrete

1221
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,760
things i'd like to maybe interview ned

1222
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,440
and

1223
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,880
murray i'd like some feedback from you

1224
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,640
and uh clearly anyone else martin

1225
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,160
would appreciate some feedback if you

1226
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,200
have any

1227
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,480
um

1228
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,319
uh and i know that mark nottingham said

1229
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,160
at one point he thought the spec was a

1230
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,880
bad idea and so i'd like to chase him

1231
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,359
down and see if he still thinks that

1232
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,400
um

1233
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,400
then you know revise the spec based on

1234
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,160
that and then i'm wondering about a

1235
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,920
finalization timeline there's there's no

1236
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,920
real rush um

1237
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,440
uh but uh there are multiple w3c working

1238
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,880
groups that are just in a holding

1239
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,559
pattern right now

1240
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:23,839
in fact the working groups have shut

1241
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,440
down and they're just like well i guess

1242
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,680
we'll register the media type whenever

1243
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,800
uh the multiple suffix thing is is um

1244
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,760
handled

1245
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,520
uh so we've got at least three different

1246
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,440
specs there that are waiting to register

1247
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,599
their their media types on the spec and

1248
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,760
it would be good to kind of understand

1249
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,160
where the group feels we are on

1250
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,079
you know finalization

1251
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,880
that's it harold back over to you

1252
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,839
thank you

1253
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,480
oh

1254
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,760
mike is open i put myself in my queue

1255
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,040
speaking as participants

1256
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,040
the

1257
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,040
the fibbing attack has been

1258
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,720
one of the more successful delivery

1259
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,240
methods for for

1260
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,720
viruses carried over email

1261
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,400
so it's not

1262
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,960
hypothetical it's very very real

1263
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,119
the other thing i was thinking of when

1264
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,440
reading through your security section

1265
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,640
is that it needs to

1266
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,839
say explicitly that

1267
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,319
when you're doing unpacking you do you

1268
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,800
have to consider security

1269
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,520
for all the thing the levels

1270
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,440
for instance there's a well-known attack

1271
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
on gzip

1272
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,240
which called gz bomb

1273
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,319
where you just

1274
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,880
provide certain primitives in gzip that

1275
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,720
expand to a file of a

1276
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,040
near infinite size

1277
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,759
and if you just

1278
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,200
blindly unpack anything without proper

1279
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,000
guard guards against such things then

1280
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,880
you will be sorry

1281
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,520
so that's uh just another another few

1282
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,119
words in the in the

1283
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,040
security section should take care of

1284
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,279
that

1285
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,799
and john

1286
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,160
yeah just to to follow up on that before

1287
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,480
getting to the point i wanted to make

1288
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,359
um

1289
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,520
it it's also true whether you classified

1290
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,160
a security problem or not that sometimes

1291
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,599
lying on

1292
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,480
uh media types is

1293
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,760
is is a problem as well and uh and

1294
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,400
occurs inadvertently but is no less

1295
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,680
disruptive

1296
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,240
uh and uh and if people need examples of

1297
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,160
that contact me offline

1298
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,920
uh and i will send you an appropriate

1299
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,960
message

1300
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,880
um

1301
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,280
but the other observation is and and i

1302
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,119
don't know if there's anything useful to

1303
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,920
be said about it now or done with it now

1304
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,160
uh but back at the dawn of time when

1305
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,680
when rfc 1590 was written

1306
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,680
my recollection is that we had a brief

1307
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,599
discussion about

1308
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,599
uh structured

1309
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,040
um

1310
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,960
uh subtypes

1311
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,640
and we came to the conclusion the right

1312
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,400
solution was parameters and not

1313
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,319
structured subtypes

1314
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,000
uh because structured subtypes led to

1315
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,599
precisely the slippery slope uh

1316
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,559
confusion multiple suffixes example

1317
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,040
which was given to be in this talk

1318
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,119
and i don't know how much further we

1319
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,880
want to go down this path

1320
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,960
this is a problem that we

1321
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,960
failed to deal with at the time the

1322
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,680
media types became a

1323
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,000
male and weapons maybe other things

1324
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,240
thing rather than a male thing

1325
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,319
a process we didn't bring the parameter

1326
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:43,920
stuff over

1327
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,359
but uh

1328
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,480
but my concern is that we're uh

1329
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,720
we're moving down a path

1330
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,040
as we go from one suffix to multiple

1331
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,520
suffixes and possibly questions about

1332
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,119
which suffixes are more important than

1333
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,599
which other suffixes in which we really

1334
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,400
dig ourselves into a whole and then uh

1335
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,319
and then reach out for a bigger shovel

1336
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,359
and i don't know the solution

1337
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,440
thank you thanks

1338
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,920
martin

1339
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,559
you have the last word

1340
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,440
i i just wanted to say that

1341
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,960
it wasn't totally clear to me whether

1342
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,640
you actually when you

1343
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,760
there's a registry of suffixes

1344
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,319
and the question is whether you also

1345
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,839
need a registry of suffix combinations

1346
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,280
or not

1347
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,440
and also the question by the way then

1348
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,150
register

1349
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,960
[Music]

1350
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,640
subtypes

1351
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,319
that include

1352
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,960
the fixed combination of suffixes

1353
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,200
that they can be used with

1354
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,160
or whether this is just some kind of

1355
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,920
uh well if if i attach for example a

1356
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,440
gzip

1357
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,000
plus gzip somewhere it just means it's

1358
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,319
it's gzipped and it's whatever is inside

1359
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:12,079
so how how um

1360
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,640
permissionless do we want to be there or

1361
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,920
not

1362
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,079
i i don't know but i think that's

1363
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,000
something that we should

1364
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,400
explicitly

1365
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,599
discuss and decide

1366
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:32,799
on that's it yes

1367
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,760
so we have thank you

1368
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,640
so we have uh

1369
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,720
four minutes left on there on agenda

1370
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,400
so we'll just have to say

1371
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,799
please please please review this

1372
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,599
document and attach comment send

1373
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,000
comments

1374
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,680
the question of

1375
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,960
of what needs to be registered in order

1376
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,920
to do this multi-level processing

1377
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,440
is a

1378
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,240
very key one

1379
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,480
we might have we might decide that we

1380
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,559
have to register all legal combinations

1381
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,640
so we might have to decide that we have

1382
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,599
to

1383
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,440
register

1384
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,319
only the suffixes and

1385
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,480
say nothing about which they

1386
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,160
which

1387
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,160
types they can be used to it

1388
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,079
or it might come down on some

1389
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,280
alternative i mean

1390
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,799
is text slash plain plus gzip

1391
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,240
legal

1392
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,079
mind type

1393
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,000
now at the moment it's not but will the

1394
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,359
will it be after we approve this

1395
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,839
document

1396
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,480
yep

1397
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,839
so that

1398
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,680
we have to i don't know if the answer is

1399
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,440
yes or no but i know what no that the

1400
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,960
document has to give a clear answer

1401
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,400
okay

1402
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,520
we have now gone through these three

1403
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,119
documents

1404
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,760
we have three minutes left i have one

1405
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,680
thing listed under

1406
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,760
any other business which means it came

1407
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,680
up on the mailing list

1408
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,440
which is that if we choose to open up

1409
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,240
6838 for revision

1410
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,960
which is another thing that doc the work

1411
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,040
group has to decide

1412
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,640
should we drop the mac file types

1413
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,160
from the

1414
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,680
from what

1415
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,760
from the forms that people fill out

1416
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,200
given that most people don't have any

1417
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,400
idea

1418
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,640
i'm unlocking the queue again now

1419
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,118
martin

1420
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,359
if we don't open the 6838 for revision

1421
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:51,359
but the fact that the

1422
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:54,000
well if it gets confirmed on the mailing

1423
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,359
list

1424
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,160
if my document goes forward

1425
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,520
it's already doing an update of

1426
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,000
6838

1427
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
just wanted to say that

1428
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,720
yeah thank you

1429
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,160
alexa

1430
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,319
yeah alexi um not sure about the whole

1431
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,960
reopening thing that might be a bit

1432
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,200
process heavy but um

1433
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,760
as far as mag types is concerned i kind

1434
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,839
of tend to defer completely to net on

1435
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:27,680
this because he's a mac user he has more

1436
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,799
i wouldn't like to take it out until uh

1437
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,880
he comments and i know at the moment

1438
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,200
he's not available

1439
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,359
so

1440
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,160
pete also a mac user

1441
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,880
yes pete resnick and it's been a long

1442
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,880
time since i've coded on the mac but as

1443
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,640
far as i know

1444
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,839
the mac file types are completely um

1445
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,680
deprecated on the mac

1446
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,799
it's using file extensions now so

1447
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,040
i

1448
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,359
i think is no new thing but um

1449
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,280
i think there may still be legacy

1450
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,280
support for

1451
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,839
um the old mac types but it's legacy

1452
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,680
support it's certainly not used

1453
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,280
underneath so i don't think there's any

1454
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,359
point in having them on the form

1455
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:18,960
um we could leave a space for notes and

1456
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,799
you know people can include that

1457
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,799
information if for legacy purposes they

1458
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,559
think they need to but i don't think it

1459
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,000
should be a requirement of the form

1460
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
anymore

1461
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,599
right and barry said he thinks they're

1462
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,280
gone with os 10 and it's been out for so

1463
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,000
many years i believe in the original go

1464
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,559
around of os 10 they still existed

1465
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,720
underneath

1466
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,680
but

1467
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,520
um all of the operating system stuff

1468
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,079
uses the file extensions now and not

1469
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,640
those underneath things so i i like i

1470
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,240
said i think it's perfectly reasonable

1471
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,079
to deprecate and put it in notes

1472
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,119
someplace in the form

1473
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,040
thank you

1474
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,200
with that we're at the end of our gender

1475
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,440
and i will just say

1476
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,559
we have a

1477
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,440
one action item

1478
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,119
decided on

1479
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,040
or

1480
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,160
we want we want the

1481
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,559
the top level document to be adopted by

1482
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,559
the working group

1483
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,640
we'll confirm that on lists

1484
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,359
we have one strong indication of

1485
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:26,559
preference

1486
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,599
that the document should say

1487
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,119
should say that standards track is the

1488
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,280
is an appropriate level bar

1489
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,280
whether we have more words than that we

1490
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,119
should discuss in the media yeah i think

1491
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,720
it's already in the document we're going

1492
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,040
to adopt and we'll discuss it as part of

1493
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,319
that

1494
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:47,200
okay i will just say thank you very much

1495
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,720
and see you on the mailing list

1496

01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,839
