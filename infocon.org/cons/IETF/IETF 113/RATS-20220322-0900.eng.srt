believe we'll probably be getting into

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,159
deep discussions it would be great if

27
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
you can make sure that we have

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,960
the items captured yes the only i'll

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,040
have a problem the last 15 minutes just

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,240
because that's when i have to get my kid

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,680

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,600

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,479

step three from eric start off

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,520
and then basically four from ink

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
but the

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
the presentations and the times haven't

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
changed right

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,959
they're just the order so you don't have

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,360
okay

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
i got you

42
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,920

43
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,239

so

120
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,199
as you can see and if you flip to the

121
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,759
next slide we have a very packed agenda

122
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,120
for today

123
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,280
hopefully you guys have seen this

124
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,199
because i don't know that we have a lot

125
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,039
of time we're already one minute over in

126
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,880
our our time slot

127
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
to bash it um

128
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
so i'm going to do a call

129
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,120
once twice

130
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
no changes let's go ahead and get

131
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
started

132
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,240
too late

133
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,639
no sorry go ahead hank what's the change

134
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,360
i think that i i subtly changed the

135
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,440
order of the agenda i'm sorry for that

136
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,000
because the the presentation blob is i

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,880
think

138
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,800
doing daa after uccs now so that that's

139
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,639
just a minor thing but i think the root

140
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,039
sequence is like off now if it's all in

141
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,720
sort of a group yeah go in whatever

142
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
order just as long yeah make sure that

143
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
i'm presenting what it is you're talking

144
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,599
to yeah and i have everybody's slides i

145
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,759
think i have everybody's slides

146
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,680
together uh

147
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
and so

148
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
i could present for you if you like

149
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,199
that's what i want to say i think in the

150
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,840
interest of time

151
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
we will be presenting the slides you

152
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,759
tell us how to flip them

153
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,319
uh so the only challenge would be if the

154
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,560
order is changed yeah if the orders

155
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,280
changed from what was in the

156
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,520
so so the first first up is

157
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,039

00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,120

and before i get into chara the details

166
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,360
just to remind you and review the set of

167
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,520
relationships between documents

168
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,759

uh and uh so there's a deep set of

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,279
relationships between a lot of the

174
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,200
giraffes that are being progressed and a

175
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,440
number of them are at the isg next slide

176
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,200
we are just about at a pass at the isg

177
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
there are two discusses which i believe

178
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,880
are minor and might also be

179
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,720
closed at this point we think we've

180
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
answered all the comments that are there

181
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
so we need one more vote in order to

182
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
close the document changes that have

183
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,200
occurred during the isg review

184
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,720
include adding a appendix describing ima

185
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,800
doing some reference changes and doing

186
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,760
some xpath uh syntax tweaks

187
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,279
uh i really don't think there's anything

188
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,920
that's a blocker at this point

189
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,479
next slide

190
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,720
and that's that one so that'll help you

191
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,399
get back on track right there any

192
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,240
questions on chara before i go to the

193
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,720
next one

194
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,120
all right thanks for watching

195
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
event stream subscription and this one

196
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,120
will be even shorter just to make sure

197
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,200
we uh get through stuff

198
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
uh what uh what event stream

199
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,720
subscription is is it uh takes chara

200
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,120
and the subscription work over in the

201
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,200
netcomf working group to make sure that

202
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,279
you can get a stream

203
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,040
of uh

204
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,640
tpm uh measurements off of a router or

205
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,240
another device

206
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,279
and

207
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,440
the goal here is to be able to not have

208
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
to do challenge response which is what

209
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
chara really talks about but instead get

210
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,200
a stream of information

211
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,959
when the pcrs are changing in a tpm and

212
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,279
so the result is a verifiably fresh set

213
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,560
of evidence

214
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,360
flowing from one device to another

215
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,839
next slide

216
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,800
status uh it's stable there have been

217
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,839
many comments have been some updates

218
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,079
we've been doing this mostly because as

219
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,800
we close out chara we should be able to

220
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,640
after char is done with the

221
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,480
iesg to go ahead and write a social and

222
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
socialize a security considerations

223
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,519
document

224
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,560
and then go to working group last call

225
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,399
it really is not a big document it

226
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,480
should not be a controversial one

227
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,399
but since we have a dependency on chara

228
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,959
we are sort of completing that work

229
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,680
before going and

230
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,959
requesting working group last call out

231
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,160
of this group

232
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,519
and that's pretty much the update for

233
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,839
this any questions on

234
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,200
um

235
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
on the

236
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,600
subscription work

237
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,120
none from the room

238
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
excellent and

239
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,760
last deck

240
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,200
and here's the r4c and

241
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,640
we'll keep on going so next slide

242
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
it's broken into two parts the first

243
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
part is the information element

244
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
definitions

245
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
for attestation results that are

246
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,600
generated by verifier to support

247
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,760
interactions secure interactions between

248
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
a tester and relying party

249
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,079
and so the first part is really about

250
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,000
claims effectively claims that are

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,279
generated

252
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,320
for secure interaction support

253
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,519
between two devices the second part is

254
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,000
end-to-end implementation options

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,959
both

256
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,680
via a background check model and what we

257
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,160
call ar augmented evidence which is a

258
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,120
combination of a background check and a

259
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
passport model

260
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,000
there are two implementations of this

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,040
out there

262
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,959
trusted path routing

263
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,839
which does things with a tpm

264
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,480
as well as verizon which is an open

265
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,360
sports project and i haven't updated the

266
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
slide because it actually has been

267
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,200
adopted by the confidential compute

268
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,959
consortium so that you can make the

269
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,200
interaction models with the information

270
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,560
elements work

271
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,279
in confidential compute type of

272
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,560
deployments

273
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,680
and so

274
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
this really is a general

275
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,200
uh

276
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,959
draft aimed at multiple types of

277
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,440
uh testers

278
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,839
next slide

279
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,120
now there's been a number of changes

280
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
since uh itf 112 first thing is working

281
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,279
group adoption and thanks everybody for

282
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,120
chiming in and providing comments it was

283
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
a good set of discussions on that

284
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,399
we've done a bit of text clarifications

285
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,240
on the values of specific

286
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,000
trustworthiness claims

287
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,720
and trustworthiness claims are

288
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,680
types of attestation results again that

289
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,240
are generated for the purpose of

290
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,519
understanding the trustworthiness of one

291
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,079
device for another there's also been

292
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,000
mailing list comparisons with the eat

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
security level and mailing list

294
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
comparisons of the eat software results

295
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
we'll have one slide on the software

296
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,519
results but again we're just doing a

297
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,880
quick update

298
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,639
also we've been aligning the trusted

299
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,199
path routing document

300
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,519
we have a new uh author there because of

301
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,800
the

302
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,040
the additions from meling ching from

303
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,079
china mobile so we are continuing to

304
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,000
percolate that

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,240
draft but we're not requesting working

306
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,720
group adoption until we really get some

307
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,880
market uptake there are at least some

308
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,360
people that are testing the service out

309
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
but there's no point in standardizing it

310
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,120
until we have some more general uh

311
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,040
adoption to make sure people are going

312
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,720
to go and stay with the same type of

313
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,839
deployment

314
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,839
next

315
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,639
slide

316
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,040
now quick highlight on trust reminisce

317
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,440
claims and trust rhythmist claims

318
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,600
uh as i said before this is an older

319
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,120
slide and i say it's based on the

320
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
passport model

321
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
it's really a combination of the top

322
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,519
half of the interaction model

323
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,839
which is a background check with a

324
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,079
passport model

325
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,160
and i highlighted from the slide

326
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,839
verifier b

327
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,120
and this is because we've had some

328
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,279
discussions on the mailing list

329
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,199
about what's the difference between

330
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,040
attestation results

331
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,680
that are being sent

332
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,920
from uh in the passport model

333
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,720
effectively from a central place to

334
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,600
again a a relying party that also has a

335
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,560
verifier on it and so highlighting that

336
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,079
there's a difference between attestation

337
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,639
results and the new evidence which is

338
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,079
then sent off to a verifier b

339
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,480
in the last step here is very important

340
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,680
because the relying party and verifier b

341
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,480
is a multi-uh role

342
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,199
that is gotta be well understood as we

343
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,120
define the information elements that are

344
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,199
part of the ar augmented evidence next

345
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,199
slide

346
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,639
uh other thing that i'm going to pull

347
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,079
out and we're not going to read the text

348
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,519
here there are a number of design

349
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,920
principles around

350
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,040
the ar

351
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
and in this case the ar for

352
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
trustworthiness claims

353
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,279
and these are important as well for when

354
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,519
you're designing attestation results and

355
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,320
these

356
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,720
have been in the draft for about a year

357
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
or so at this point

358
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,120
and it's very important to ins

359
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,600
understand what you're trying to

360
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,639
to

361
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,800
nail down as the rules that you're using

362
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
to create ar

363
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
in this case they're exposing a small

364
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,759
number of claims

365
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,120
uh enumerating very explicit states

366
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
making sure that

367
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,519
you have very explicit definitions that

368
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,839
rp developers understand

369
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,199
and you ex

370
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,959
support standard and non-standard

371
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,920
extensibility and as we go through the

372
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,519
trustworthiness claims in future itfs

373
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,199
making sure that these

374
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,519
trustworthiness claim

375
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,000
uh rules are hit makes things a lot

376
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,759
easier for the implementer

377
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,440
of the creation of the attestation

378
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,560
results

379
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,199
and their digestion by a policy language

380
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,040
sitting in the

381
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,920
relying party policy uh on the foreign

382
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,720
device on the right from the last slide

383
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
all right and last slide

384
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,440
we're going to probably talk about this

385
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,240
more later in the day here

386
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,160
as we go ahead and talk about some of

387
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,279
the

388
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,040
items that lawrence wants to do this is

389
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,839
a table that has undergone some

390
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,079
discussion on the mailing list over the

391
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,600
last few weeks

392
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,039
and that is the comparison of the

393
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,720
intent and design of some of the

394
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,039
trustworthiness claims for executables

395
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,559
and file system

396
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,480
and some of the claims over in the east

397
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,799
side with software results which i think

398
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,959
might be getting renamed

399
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,480
and

400
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,559
while we dive into it i wanted to

401
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,240
highlight that there

402
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,640
are certain things that we want to make

403
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,280
sure that we handle when we look at the

404
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,480
various

405
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,600
uh

406
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,919
specific objects that we're handling for

407
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,320
example these things are what is the

408
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
target that's being

409
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,000
evaluated what are the number of

410
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
includable states and how understandable

411
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
are they and how complex is the language

412
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,720
for then having a policy on the um

413
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,160
target device

414
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,720
what is the purpose of the

415
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,640
of the um

416
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,799
of the claim what are the different

417
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,280
encodings and serialization that is

418
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,960
needed so

419
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,640
i don't think we have time to dive into

420
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,720
this but i want to keep this in the back

421
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,280
uh pocket to understand that there

422
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,600
really should be some commonality of the

423
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
claim designs

424
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
as we try to figure out what needs to be

425
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,799
encoded for passing across the network

426
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,000
particularly when we're talking about

427
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,440
writing some

428
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,200
policy language on the relying party for

429
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
interpreting what's going to be coming

430
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,120
from the

431
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,679
attestation results and please chime in

432
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,120
on the mailing list if you have any

433
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,840
specific comments about these but there

434
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,679
is a lot of meat in this slide we don't

435
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,600
have the time to digest but i think it's

436
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,799
a important for your your consideration

437
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,640
and i think that's all the slides i have

438
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,919
at this point now if there's any

439
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,360
questions on r4c

440
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,440
no but um eric i want to go back since

441
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,960
roman put in the um chat

442
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,080
for the

443
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
chara draft

444
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,640
yes

445
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,200
uh he noted that it would be good if you

446
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
can get the

447
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,679
discusses addressed before the turnover

448
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,679
completes

449
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,840
so roman i don't know when that turnover

450
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,039
completes

451
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
anyway because you have enough votes now

452
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,640
to make it move forward

453
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,240
you just need to address them and and

454
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,600
read the draft

455
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,280
all right as far as i know the

456
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,440
discussion has been closed covered i

457
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,400
just need the responses from people on

458
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
yeah correct so this is roman jumping in

459
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,640
since i i got invoked yeah eric is

460
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,720
exactly right i'm in contact with kind

461
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,160
of rob to please ask him to to re rob

462
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,240
rob wilton to revisit his discuss

463
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,840
because i believe the edits that the

464
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,919
team put out thank you eric uh

465
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,080
uh do address the do address the

466
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,679
feedback and the ballot turnover will

467
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,600
happen on wednesday at the at the

468
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,880
plenary so

469
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
we're all pushing to get things cleared

470
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,799
as fast as possible

471
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,480
excellent right so if anybody sees rob

472
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,840
in the hallway grab them and take them

473
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,480
to a computer

474
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,960
and i know and i saw him on sunday

475
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,039
but i'll keep that in mind

476
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,320
thanks eric

477
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,200
all right thanks everybody

478
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,960
okay up next is architecture

479
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,320
hi i'm hank i have been have been told

480
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,600
by the list to present my name i'm hank

481
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
and this is about the architecture so um

482
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
michael richardson most uh mostly did

483
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,640
all of this content so this is a report

484
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,080
because we are in uh in a good state the

485
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,880
tiny little letters on the left side are

486
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,080
hiding who's um contributing in the last

487
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
half year and longer uh

488
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,960
helping us getting this document uh done

489
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,280
uh there are some little star asterisks

490
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
at some of the names these are the

491
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,440
editors of the documents so we have now

492
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,559
uh

493
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,720
no remaining issues uh 185 in total

494
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,440
the tuesday's meetings are and hiatus at

495
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,720
the moment

496
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,760
and we

497
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,440
have addressed

498
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
literally all of the pull requests

499
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,480
except the ones after uh my uh editorial

500
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,039
cutoff so we will not touch any uh

501
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,520
content of the document until there will

502
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,679
be a next action um that might be

503
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,039
i don't know actually

504
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,158
so uh next slide

505
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
which is what is happening next that's

506
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,640
the conclusion so we have a diff you can

507
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,480
look at it we added a

508
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,000
few things at the end we um upgraded the

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
references

510
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,840
and our state is a very limbo state of

511
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,400
uh being submitted to isg which can mean

512
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,440
everything i assume it's not dead

513
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,280
and so i don't know what's happening

514
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,799
next now so we will not edit anything

515
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,799
at that document at the moment until we

516
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,440
know what the further steps are so that

517
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,200
is my question to the room

518
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,840
what are we doing now

519
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,280
so roman you can help me out now that

520
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,600
it's an iesg publication it does go up

521
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,720
to the isg i expect to have reviews from

522
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,039
the ads you'll get feedback that would

523
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,159
be great there has no been has no issue

524
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,600
no no no doctors no directorate no area

525
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,360
has done reuse yet

526
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,120
so that might be the

527
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,960
next thing i guess

528
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,080
well so roman help help me out here

529
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,799
do you want me to trigger

530
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,520
a directorate review

531
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,039
i mean

532
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,200
i apologize i was uh i was in the chat

533
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
window are we talking about the rats

534
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,240
architecture document correct

535
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,039
yes so right so none of the pre

536
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,360
working group last call reviews were

537
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
triggered it's in pub wreck for me

538
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,320
behind a much larger document i have it

539
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
half open so i would say just for

540
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,679
expediency give me the rest of the week

541
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,000
and i'm sorry the rest of the week after

542
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,159
ietf week and i should have it because i

543
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,960
think that my early review

544
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,240
dropped all the comments i would have

545
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
and they they largely appear resolved i

546
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,440
just need to double check and then we

547
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
can go to ietf less call and trigger

548
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,280
their direct reviews so the action is

549
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,320
with me

550
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,120
so we are not in the final last call yet

551
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,000
we have had the last last call and now

552
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,559
we initiate the next working group last

553
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,840
call is that correct no no it's the

554
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,159
publication has been requested

555
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,559
right okay thank you

556
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,240
it was not matching what i was thinking

557
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,960
it was on the slides so he said ietf

558
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,120
last call oh okay i was sorry thank you

559
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,880
okay then that's it that's basically

560
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,919
what we're at um so uh as roman said the

561
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,760
actions are now clear

562
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,559
and we can move on to the next

563
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,960
item

564
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,960
i'm shocked

565
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,640
ah interesting

566
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,240
that's the next item

567
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,120
okay

568
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,400
um so

569
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,760
we have uh we have a daa document in an

570
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
adopted state

571
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,679
that has happened due to the split from

572
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,919
the uh interaction a reference

573
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,000
interaction model document

574
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,799
um daa by itself seems to be its own

575
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,440
thing that has is worth worth discussing

576
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,279
having its own issue tracking and i

577
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,720
think that's fine

578
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,360
so now we uh recently

579
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,640
uh

580
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,039
convinced the failure to be a co-editor

581
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:23,919
of this

582
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,320
and now we have a few next steps to be

583
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,960
done so um i don't know how familiar

584
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,679
with da i think the timing is not for me

585
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,600
enough for me to uh to highlight all of

586
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,400
this but there's a daa issuer it's about

587
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,799
anonymity so then you can't really

588
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,440
distinguish one a tester from another

589
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,679
so that's done by having a third party

590
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,600
it's a daa issuer

591
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,840
and that might be very similar to a

592
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
rat's endorser

593
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,760
and and that has to be fleshed out so

594
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,360
there has been some comments on the list

595
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,120
and some comments on the uh on the

596
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,840
document itself that we have a strong

597
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,360
relationship here we haven't addressed

598
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,840
those yet so that is the next step one

599
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,400
next step then we have a trusted

600
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,080
computing group concept called the

601
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,120
privacy ca uh privacy would also be

602
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,960
literally in support of being a dia

603
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,039
issuer so we haven't been talking about

604
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,880
that in the text right now but it's i

605
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,640
guess the same function

606
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,080
so that has to be uh again elaborated on

607
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,159
and then we have the dice concept the

608
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,400
composer identifiers from tcg that's

609
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,440
using not

610
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,360
hardware root of trust about the

611
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,840
existence of a certificate and if the

612
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,279
certificate um creation chain uh has

613
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,600
been is there so if you with an

614
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,639
existence of a

615
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,080
rule of trust

616
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,600
certificate exists

617
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,799
so then then you can can imply that all

618
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,120
the other certificates were fine so

619
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,039
there's a the trust consumption of the

620
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,760
dust chain in the dice concept and that

621
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,480
again would have to be addressed and

622
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,279
correlated to the daa issuer flow that's

623
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,120
been done so i think that's been done

624
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,320
outside of tc of our atf in the tcg but

625
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,919
again the document doesn't talk about

626
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,840
that so these are the three items i

627
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,640
think we want to uh um do on a working

628
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,120
group level next i i'm pretty sure that

629
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,360
not everybody is super interested in all

630
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,080
of these but this is a group attestation

631
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,799
thing and there are a lot of identical

632
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,279
things and i don't know cloud centers or

633
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,559
iot swarms that would uh really benefit

634
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,600
from this

635
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,520
because you don't really know that that

636
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,760
exact thing was wrong but maybe the

637
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,440
concept of your whole swamp might be

638
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,159
wrong and so so that's the attestation

639
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,080
uh our scope that we are targeting here

640
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,840
for and so

641
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,600
that is our next steps but i have to

642
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,240
admit that we haven't prioritized that

643
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,840
work at the moment so that's just a

644
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,559
status report any questions on that

645
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,720
can you get up and

646
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,320
recognize yourself sure

647
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
yeah hi this is lawrence um i just

648
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,360
wanted to understand um is it focused i

649
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,080
mean

650
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,120
dea could apply to eat as well as chara

651
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,559
i don't know what you're thinking is

652
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,039
about that i mean it's uh

653
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,360
so i just wanted to yeah i i bring that

654
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,919
issue up could apply but i have no clue

655
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,559
how it would okay so if you have an idea

656
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,559
how to map that we are welcoming any

657
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,520
input on that i think that's great yeah

658
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,080
but that hasn't been done yet so that we

659
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,159
literally knew work right and it might

660
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,000
even be another document i'm not sure

661
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,880
yeah but but yeah but i think yes uh

662
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,600
testing a group of uh sorry i'm

663
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,679
i'm creating a trustworthiness

664
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,159
assertions about a group of similar

665
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,000
things that you don't want to be

666
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,720
distinguished i think it's a real world

667
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,640
application that a lot of people want

668
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,279
and if it can help us there sure yeah or

669
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,120
maybe it's just maybe it's kosei work

670
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,480
also

671
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,520
yeah okay

672
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,080
all each work summer was cozy work i

673
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,360
think

674
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,600
um so you might you might have split off

675
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
some some uh input there so thomas

676
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,799
arjunu is putting in the uh comments

677
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,399
that daa has been designed for the tpm

678
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,559
and the current draft would need more

679
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,039
work um if we wanted to look into

680
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,200
privacy ca for dice

681
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,600
yeah that is exactly true that is my

682
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
point because it hasn't been done yet

683
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,279
that's item too

684
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,120
that's precisely this is the envelope

685
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,480
that's precisely to understand this

686
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,399
because this is new to me and i wanted

687
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,440
to

688
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,039
so the goal is about as you said to not

689
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,679
necessarily distinguish among many

690
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,520
similar things that you don't care or is

691
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,000
about because looking at the private cca

692
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,360
the first impression you get is that

693
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,200
what you want is to protect privacy of

694
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,120
the of the attester for whatever the

695
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,520
reason yeah whatever the reason exactly

696
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,760
yeah but but we're talking about many

697
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
similar things privacy doesn't make any

698
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,080
sense there just to understand what

699
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,919
we're talking about so if i'm talking

700
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,679
about i want to say

701
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,679
some cell phone and you know all of

702
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,679
these are kind of identical

703
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,679
and we're not talking about the sim card

704
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,600
thing the individual part but the rest

705
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,360
of the composite device

706
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,279
and now you can do a group attestation

707
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,880
for all the cell phones at the same

708
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,080
brand for

709
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,919
scope let's say it's an enterprise yeah

710
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,159
but but this is a let's say this is a

711
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,760
case that is related

712
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,600
with privacy because a cell phone is

713
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,279
associated with a human that is moving

714
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,240
around

715
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
and that's why you have the daa issuer

716
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
they give you a certificate that's not

717
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,559
individual okay so it's a group group

718
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,720
okay so that's it but it's applicable

719
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,240
there and on the other hand is

720
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,480
applicable to i don't know one million

721
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,279
uh

722
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,159
i don't know uh temperature or humidity

723
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,000
sensors that we can spread exactly with

724
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,679
the devices nothing to do with privacy

725
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,039
in the on the other hand exactly the

726
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,840
devices do not lose their individuality

727
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
they get issued something they can say

728
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,440
but i'm of this group

729
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,120
that's basically the role of the issuer

730
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
and that's why it might also be an

731
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,720
endorser because endorser is very

732
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,799
similar to that so there's a bit of some

733
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,399
discussion how to generalize it for

734
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,039
example for it yeah

735
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,880
diego would you mind re restating

736
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,320
because uh gidi missed your comment

737
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,399
for the minutes

738
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,880
and if you can just go to the notes and

739
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,440
update it that would be great

740
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,360
okay

741
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,120
uh lawrence again one one you have to

742
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,799
make it quick because we need to move on

743
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,880
that's fine uh i just wanted to respond

744
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,960
to thomas d.a.a my understanding is a

745
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,799
general cryptographic

746
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,360
concept it's not bound to tpms for

747
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,919
example fido supports the da protocol in

748
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,360
some ways and there are a lot of flavors

749
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,240
of daa and so there's a it's a big rich

750
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,080
space and it's not

751
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,720
associated with tpm's solely

752
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,559
so i'm not thomas so i'm not putting

753
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,880
worth in his mouth but i would say

754
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,000
yes

755
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,399
but the only specification existing are

756
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,120
we tbms

757
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,720
thank you

758
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,440
that is not wrong but fido has no dice

759
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,960
extension because we are working on that

760
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,399
right now on my institute and i'm pretty

761
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,240
sure about that yes

762
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,559
okay can we can we take that to the mail

763
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,240
list please and

764
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,159
but i think what i'm hearing is there's

765
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,720
a distinction to the two use cases tpm

766
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,559
versus otherwise so

767
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,559
it'd be would be good to clarify have

768
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,880
the authors clarify it as well as you

769
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,720
lawrence as to what your intent is but

770
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,080
i'm pretty sure there's no dice

771
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
extension in fighter please do that on

772
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,360
the mail list

773
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,559
okay

774
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,960
sure we do that so next slide please

775
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,039
uh it's an action model it's cool um so

776
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,039
yeah that's where we split the dar stuff

777
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,279
off and we've already heard eric talk

778
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,919
about the um background check model

779
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,919
about subscriptions and challenge

780
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,360
response so the yang module is about

781
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
challenge response the subscription

782
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,760
model is about apparently something else

783
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,360
again and then we have the time-based

784
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
new directional models these are general

785
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
interaction models how you convey

786
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,840
evidence and to some extent always could

787
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,080
apply to attestation results because

788
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,000
they inherit the freshness

789
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,559
characteristics so now um

790
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,880
the uh um

791
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,799
challenge the chara the challenge

792
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,519
request response attestation

793
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,000
and the subscription and the time-based

794
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,880
ones

795
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,360
are there but in the architecture of

796
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,799
rats we have defined the um

797
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,960
background check interaction model which

798
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,840
is a composition of interactions and the

799
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,640
passport model which is again a

800
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,799
composition of interactions so these

801
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,480
haven't been covered by the uh

802
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,720
interaction models id yet but there is a

803
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,440
um

804
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,279
a project linux foundation project out

805
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,200
there that's called a c2pa it's a

806
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,279
coalition of content provenance and

807
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,559
authenticity

808
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,640
and um and they want to implement all

809
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,799
this so they switched already to sieber

810
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,559
and cddi and they

811
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,720
really they really wanted to have uh we

812
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,960
need a document to refer to these

813
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,200
specific implementations

814
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,679
specific interaction combinations here

815
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,600
for the models so that's why we pull

816
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,320
that in to the mercury at the moment and

817
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,120
eric for example also highlighted the uh

818
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,519
ar augmented model

819
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,279
which is again a combination of the

820
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,880
backpack

821
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,360
round check model and the passport model

822
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,200
so so that's also something we could

823
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,799
consider to put in here we don't know

824
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,640
where the demarcation line is but i

825
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,679
think we won't go anything beyond that

826
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,360
so but that is what's happening right

827
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,200
now so c2ba

828
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
was the reason to do the uh background

829
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,559
check and password combinations and

830
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,279
today now please review that but i think

831
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,519
you're a very good state so we can also

832
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,320
unders try to find out are we good with

833
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
that

834
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,919
can we can we can we close the feature

835
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,240
like are we leaving alpha and i'll go to

836
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,399
better so i think i think that's the

837
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,519
point

838
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,240
if you feel that the um

839
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
the draft is mature enough we can do an

840
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,480
early last call and same thing i can

841
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
trigger earlier or some some um

842
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,120
directorate or uh some other people

843
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,880
aren't letting me finish that's what i

844
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,799
was going to say i can tweet an early

845
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,080
review i will let you finish that

846
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,519
rhetorical we can move on

847
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,320
what's the next thing

848
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,039
oh yeah uccs so uccs by name hasn't

849
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,360
changed but as lawrence is probably well

850
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,320
aware um be included now in the appendix

851
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,000
of the uss id

852
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,760
um a option to accommodate both json

853
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,800
cbor

854
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,960
as a feature with cddi so there are two

855
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,000
features

856
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,359
in c sorry it's

857
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,239
two

858
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,399
capabilities of the cddi

859
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,320
expressiveness one of them is called

860
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,639
feature and another one is called a

861
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,760
generic so by selecting a feature which

862
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,320
is apparently sieber or json you can now

863
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,879
switch to alternate generics that would

864
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,239
allow you to uh use the json prelude or

865
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,079
the sibo prelude and therefore it would

866
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,839
not create any conflicts with any c

867
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,320
detail definition whatsoever when you do

868
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,239
a json and sibo compliant cdl is back so

869
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,399
lawrence took note of that and and he

870
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,800
already wanted to encompass it actually

871
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,520
does incorporate it in the each spec

872
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,079
because it uh also has a target of uh

873
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,640
addressing jason and sibo so we haven't

874
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,160
changed the name

875
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,480
yet it's in the appendix

876
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,680
it's an informal uh an informative thing

877
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,520
so now i think the next question for the

878
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,760
working group is to understand

879
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,960
do we want this id to be about uccs

880
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,839
and or also

881
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,680
ujcs i think it would be called then

882
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,160
right so so we didn't dare to do that

883
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,560
just without consensus but this is

884
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,079
basically the the

885
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,839
the call out to uh

886
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,599
um that we can start that discussion on

887
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,560
the list

888
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,200
um and and if we want if everybody is

889
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
want to have that i think it's it's not

890
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,280
specifically related to rats

891
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
um but i think it's very important to

892
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,480
highlight that

893
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,720
um every any

894
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,040
um specification about something

895
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,320
unprotected has to come with a very

896
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,160
prescriptive

897
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,480
threat model that tells you why it's

898
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,680
okay

899
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,119
to have these

900
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,240
claims sets be it in or sabor

901
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,320
i'm protected so what we're doing here

902
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,280
is we're introducing the concept

903
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,839
and we always bundle it with at least

904
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,400
the very first application scenario and

905
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,599
that's rats

906
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,599
so i think it's still very fine to have

907
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,760
this in reds because we can't

908
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,680
release the concept into the wild by

909
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,359
saying and then you have to do a threat

910
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,280
model and this is just how you do it

911
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,880
because then people will just do it that

912
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,400
way and don't

913
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,320
have to write down

914
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,480
their security implication about why

915
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,839
you're doing this

916
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,359
and how this is done i think that's a

917
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,880
very important part of uccs and now if

918
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,280
it would become something that you yet

919
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,440
you jcs also

920
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,920
yeah but it even gets more important so

921
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
so that's why this is in rats

922
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,040
it's actually about cwts

923
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,880
but you can't just do this with any cwt

924
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,760
they have to serve a purpose like eat

925
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,920
and then you have the threat model and

926
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,839
the security consideration about that

927
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,680
that's what's happening in this id so

928
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,400
that's why it's not in a cwt space

929
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,640
that's why it is in the red space but in

930
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,680
general to be honest the core of it can

931
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,359
apply to any kind

932
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,680
of cwt i hope that makes sense to you if

933
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
not maybe look at the draft a bigger

934
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,560
discussion on the list

935
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,320
okay gary just mentioned as an editor

936
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,119
he's recommending decisions on uccs be

937
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,680
deferred

938
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,960
after his presentation

939
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,119
thinking they'll be deciding anything in

940
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,119
the next few days that's what i was

941
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,599
going to say

942
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,400
i didn't think we were deciding anything

943
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,400
i'm just i'm just highlighting that this

944
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,200
is why this isn't right

945
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,800
i think that's the last slide i think i

946
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,320
have to present on

947
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,520
yes

948
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,839
yes so lauren's next and i bye-bye

949
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
hello

950
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,079
this is lawrence um so that's uh the

951
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,000
slide i've always presented kind of the

952
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,839
the list of planned eat claims

953
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,000
because otherwise every time you turn

954
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,119
your head around

955
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,560
you miss the audio

956
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,078
all right is that better yeah okay

957
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,400
there we go

958
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,040
i'm not i'm not into that kind of

959
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,870
never done karaoke

960
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,200
[Music]

961
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
you try it out now

962
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,920
um what no

963
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,279
next slide okay please

964
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,480
so here's a uh kind of a status of the

965
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,760
the blue arrows of things that have

966
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,400
changed in the dash 12 uh draft um so

967
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,000
that's where work was done

968
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,760
um and as you can see most of everything

969
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,000
is green which means it's ready for last

970
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,200
call so

971
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,359
the two areas that are still need some

972
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,280
work just in terms of the individual

973
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,720
claims are

974
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,040
you know measurements and results

975
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,280
basically stuff related to attestation

976
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,200
results ar

977
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,359
next slide

978
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,119
uh here's just a list of uh interesting

979
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,400
changes from the the dash 12 draft um

980
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,800
with the definitely improvement in the

981
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,680
language mostly thanks to comments from

982
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,359
hanus

983
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,000
we added the hardware model claim so now

984
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,760
that there's this

985
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
oem id hardware model and hardware

986
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,800
version as uh identifiers for devices

987
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,440
that kind of a standard triple

988
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,800
then there was

989
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,760
the boot odometer claim was added um

990
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,480
uh some privacy considerations um

991
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,440
the hardware version claim was improved

992
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,160
um and then the uh ayanna section was

993
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,079
was filled in to some degree the main

994
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,160
purpose of the the dash 12 draft was

995
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,920
actually to get um

996
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,000
things published for early allocation

997
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,440
which uh

998
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
that's uh i'm not going to talk about

999
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,480
that today i think that's just

1000
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,560
administrative at this point next slide

1001
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,160
uh so here's a uh thing i wanted to

1002
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,839
bring highlight um

1003
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,160
planning for the dash 13 draft is to

1004
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,480
group the claims uh

1005
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,240
in uh you know they're all in just one

1006
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,880
big list now put them into four uh so

1007
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,680
one is claims about the entity

1008
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,960
so these are the things we've been

1009
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,240
thinking about a lot in the past already

1010
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,920
then there's claims about the token

1011
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,160
itself so these are things

1012
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,240
like the profile of the token what the

1013
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,480
intended use of it is uh you know what

1014
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,720
is expected to be in the token or not

1015
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,560
uh the and the timestamp so you're kind

1016
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,079
of separating what are claims kind of

1017
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,000
metadata about the token versus claims

1018
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,319
that are about the the entity

1019
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,880
and um that was kind of came to light

1020
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,760
partly in the ar discussion

1021
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
and then nonce is kind of a special case

1022
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
because it kind of goes through and then

1023
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,359
there's also some uh discussion about

1024
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,240
how to include key public keys um and

1025
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,400
that's not exactly a claim so there's a

1026
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,240
pr to um uh

1027
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,000
you know rearrange the sections that

1028
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
also has some good discussion about ar

1029
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
in it um that that pr

1030
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,560
next

1031
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,760
uh

1032
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,599
in the this is this is the um work queue

1033
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,839
one of the the items is just to complete

1034
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,359
the cdl um and get it all to work

1035
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,440
that jc

1036
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
generic is the one that hank was

1037
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,720
referring to um

1038
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,000
and that's the uh ability to write cdl

1039
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,280
that can be

1040
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,359
verified against uh

1041
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,230
json or verified against sebor

1042
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,160
[Music]

1043
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,800
that's an interesting thing i mean the i

1044
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,760
think the

1045
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,800
cddl tool is a little bit shaky on on

1046
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,720
the the jason parley so i've had some

1047
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,920
trouble with that

1048
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,640
um and uh so there's there's some work

1049
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,480
that'll that'll be in the dash 13 draft

1050
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,680
the um

1051
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,760
you know finishing that off um

1052
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,880
that uh

1053
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,680
jc generic actually is making the cdl a

1054
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,319
lot simpler so it's actually uh

1055
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,400
helpful i mean i think it's we're on the

1056
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,319
edge here in terms of the use of cvdl

1057
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,359
but i think it's a good direction

1058
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,280
and then that uh rearranging the

1059
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,280
sections to to

1060
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,960
group the claims better i think that's a

1061
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,319
good one

1062
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,160
uh that that's uh

1063
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,000
that's basically straightforward work um

1064
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,880
next next slide

1065
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,160
so here's uh topics that i think we need

1066
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,240
consensus on still

1067
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,040
so there's some uh

1068
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,440
issue about the relationship between eat

1069
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,160
and uccs and geary's going to talk about

1070
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,800
that i think the real core here is is

1071
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,119
there a normative reference or not and

1072
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,599
what's the uh

1073
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,760
the sort of dependency and the ordering

1074
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,920
and like you know in terms of last call

1075
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,280
process and stuff like that we don't

1076
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,200
want it to get hung up

1077
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,520
by a hard dependency on on uccs

1078
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,560
um there's the security level claim uh

1079
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,920
there's been a lot of discussion on that

1080
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,280
i'm not saying that's a showstopper but

1081
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,480
we got to figure out what we're going to

1082
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,520
do

1083
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,920
and then um there's the the attestation

1084
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,520
results discussion

1085
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,520
so you know what's its role in

1086
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,359
attestation results is attestation

1087
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,560
results a separate profile

1088
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,920
is there a general

1089
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,040
result code what's its result

1090
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,040
relation to ar 4si

1091
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,200
and i think there's a discussion later

1092
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,119
today for that

1093
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,680
next slide

1094
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,118
okay that's it for for me

1095
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,440
questions do we have we have time for

1096
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,359
questions no you're a minute and a half

1097
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,598
over

1098
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,640
um we can save that for later if there's

1099
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,680
questions

1100
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,920
is it is it guy or who's who's

1101
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,800
presenting on riv guy or eric

1102
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,240
uh uh hi nancy it's guy guy hey guy

1103
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,760
you're up next

1104
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,359
how are you doing

1105
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,520
oh thanks for

1106
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,040
being in the queue

1107
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,280
hang on hang on

1108
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,200
roman were you in the queue i didn't see

1109
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,480
you

1110
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,960
there you go

1111
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,240
go ahead roman

1112
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,400
what did you announce the the really

1113
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,079
great news if folks weren't watching the

1114
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,480
mailing list that the early allocation

1115
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,200
for eats are now approved through the

1116
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,880
through kind of the the normal kind of

1117
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,119
processes so at this point what we are

1118
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,359
waiting for is ayanna to just perform

1119
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,079
their batch administrative action to get

1120
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,960
those claims posted

1121
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,880
thanks to michael for helping mike jones

1122
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,599
indeed thank you mike

1123
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,800
okay nancy mike jones

1124
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,400
of course um

1125
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,720
i think the discussion educated a lot of

1126
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,960
people including myself so

1127
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,800
i'm glad we had it no and i appreciate

1128
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,440
you helping expedite it

1129
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,400
all right with that sorry guy

1130
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,440
okay

1131
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,960
you can go

1132
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,520
yep it's uh it's guy for darko speaking

1133
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,920
uh on behalf of the

1134
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,760
um

1135
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,880
remote integrity verification draft uh

1136
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,440
um next please

1137
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,079
i think we're doing pretty well uh just

1138
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,640
as a reminder the objective here is to

1139
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,880
standardize the way that you could you

1140
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,160
that you can use uh tpm based

1141
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,720
devices to do remote attestation that is

1142
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,480
to assess the

1143
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,240
the the uh

1144
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,200
uh integrity of the software and

1145
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,119
of the device that you're you're trying

1146
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,240
to

1147
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,040
validate the point is to make this

1148
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,720
technology which has been around for a

1149
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,160
while with

1150
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,440
tcg equipment to make it into

1151
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,040
something that can be

1152
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,680
used by network operators

1153
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,919
with

1154
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,839
without requiring a proprietary work

1155
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,760
along the way to standardize the

1156
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,440
interfaces

1157
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,839
next please

1158
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,119
um as a reminder this is the

1159
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,800
following the so-called background check

1160
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,119
model that is you you go to the device

1161
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,960
and ask it

1162
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,480
how it's doing uh and then the verifier

1163
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,119
looks at the results to produce uh

1164
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,440
uh a passport if you will to say that uh

1165
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,359
sorry to produce a result which says

1166
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,599
whether the device is uh

1167
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,800
working uh as intended

1168
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,760
this does not include explicitly riv

1169
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
does not explicitly include the

1170
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
interaction with the relying party that

1171
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,640
that

1172
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,560
we declared out of scope at the start

1173
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,119
but is

1174
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,560
subject to the same discussions that

1175
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,640
we've been having about how you

1176
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,560
how you communicate between verifiers

1177
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,520
and

1178
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,599
and relying parties

1179
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,480
um

1180
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,280
next please

1181
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,040
um i think the status is that

1182
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,440
the discuss comments i think have been

1183
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,599
resolved um

1184
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,880
there are

1185
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,200
a couple of other

1186
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,880
uh none

1187
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,960
as i understand non-blocking comments

1188
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,240
which require resolution

1189
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,160
but i don't think those are hard

1190
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,960
and i think i can probably get them done

1191
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,119
even

1192
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,480
perhaps today or tomorrow

1193
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,359
and from there i think we're on to

1194
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:30,000
the rfc editor as i understand it

1195
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,200
next

1196
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,400
yeah so

1197
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,800
again the next step is simply to resolve

1198
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,240
the the couple of

1199
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,760
the couple of comments that are still

1200
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,280
open

1201
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,599
and i think that's all i need to say the

1202
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,520
next slide is eric's um

1203
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,400
eric's uh document chart so

1204
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,839
we've seen that in the previous

1205
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,440
presentations

1206
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,359
are there any questions on this

1207
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,000
no i appreciate your responsiveness in

1208
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
trying to get this draft done it may be

1209
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,760
the the first draft out of the rats

1210
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,400
working group

1211
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,319
well

1212
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,400
yeah you see it we're

1213
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,760
we've been keeping it more or less

1214
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,920
synchronized with chara as well so i i

1215
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,200
think phil

1216
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,480
well

1217
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,640
they're both going together their

1218
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,280
package still

1219
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,200
okay

1220
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,480
thank you

1221
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,400
all right

1222
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,559
with that um

1223
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,040
next step is for us to have the

1224
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,800
discussion on the charter

1225
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,760
there's been quite a lot of exchange on

1226
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,920
the mail list

1227
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,880
as the chairs we believe that

1228
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,280
um i don't know it may be worthwhile for

1229
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,359
you to share

1230
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,520
the charter text if you can

1231
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,440
so we started the this well we started

1232
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,599
the discussion a while back but back in

1233
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,839
ietf 112

1234
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,800
there was agreement that um

1235
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,319
there was some new work that needed to

1236
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,880
be done that wasn't in the charter we

1237
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,599
needed to expand the charter

1238
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,480
there was some proposed text we did a

1239
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,280
call for interest

1240
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,760
to see if there was interest by the

1241
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,079
participants in this working group

1242
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,400
if they wanted to extend the charter

1243
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,599
and if they liked the proposed text and

1244
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,200
so

1245
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,119
there was a lot of discussion that went

1246
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,720
on in the mail list

1247
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,000
um and so we wanted to

1248
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,359
do the pulse again here i'm trying to

1249
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,040
talk as much

1250
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,520
well while ned brings up the text

1251
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,960
um

1252
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,280
to see if there were any other remaining

1253
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,200
issues vis-a-vis

1254
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,040
the revised text for us to recharter

1255
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,960
the group

1256
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,000
so um

1257
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000

1258
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,520

okay

1268
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:48,000
so i'll take your poll literally

1269
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,760
um

1270
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,280
so i want to have a show of hands of who

1271
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,960
has read

1272
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,119
the um

1273
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,559
proposed charter text

1274
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,200
of course i'm the one typing this

1275
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,000
um and ned ned is showing the charter

1276
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,640
text um

1277
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,800
oh

1278
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,119
so this is wrong that's the old chart

1279
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,119
text that's what we already have that's

1280
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,640
the existing scope

1281
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,280
yeah the one on github

1282
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,200
that's the proposed new charter text

1283
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,960
that would have been interesting if

1284
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,319
people have checked now

1285
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,558
yeah

1286
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,839
wow is a test

1287
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,359
who is awake okay i did start

1288
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,480
the poll

1289
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,760
um

1290
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,880
so raise your hands if you have read the

1291
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,640
proposed charter text that's on github

1292
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,800
and ned will bring it up and

1293
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,760
we can

1294
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,680
we can have ned read the proposed

1295
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,879
charter text as well

1296
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,079
so we do have quite a few and there was

1297
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,200
only one

1298
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,520

1299
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,880

1304
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,920
you can't find it i'm digging for it

1305
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,559
it's uh github

1306
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,160
you want me to show this drug and

1307
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,960
clarifying so if you are using the a

1308
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,640
small light version you can vote from

1309
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,000
there or you're going to watch the full

1310
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,559
mutual conversion either one works so

1311
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,119
harness even when you have tried to get

1312
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,640
into the with the qr code you're going

1313
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,640
to vote still

1314
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,359
thank you ditto

1315
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,920
here's the link if you want to see it

1316
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,880
i think this is all right

1317
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,319
yes

1318
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,640
okay most of you have not read the

1319
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,280
charter text so

1320
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,319
ned

1321
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:28,200
will be bringing it up

1322
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,200
you can't do it

1323
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,520
of course i'm running the poll so i

1324
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,400
don't know right here

1325
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,319
yeah i will conclude the poll yeah

1326
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,800
so we had 24 participants they they had

1327
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,359
not read the text only eight had read

1328
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,319
the proposed text

1329
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,440
okay

1330
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,400
are you sharing it um i'm sharing it

1331
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,640
okay

1332
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,839
you want to read through

1333
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:11,359
it little bit of a character size

1334
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,280
increase

1335
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,280
one size

1336
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,520
thank you

1337
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,000
okay so

1338
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,720
the main change

1339
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,119
to the charter was to

1340
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,079
expand the program of work to include

1341
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,000
endorsements and reference value

1342
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
endorsers and reference value providers

1343
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,880
so

1344
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,559
that

1345
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,960
that text was added to

1346
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,680
uh

1347
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,640
item six in the program of work which is

1348
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,720
standardized interoperable data formats

1349
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,240
to securely declare and convey

1350
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,000
endorsements and reference values

1351
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,760
there was some other

1352
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,040
minor cleanup

1353
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,640
of the terms in the in the program of

1354
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,200
work but no substitute change to the

1355
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,440
original intent of the other

1356
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,559
program of work items

1357
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,160
we updated the goal saying

1358
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,359
you know since we now have an

1359
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,440
architecture draft

1360
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,799
we updated some of that text but the

1361
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:27,040
substantive change is to add the program

1362
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,640
of work

1363
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,240
again just to reiterate um

1364
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,839
adding to our charter on standardizing

1365
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,640
the data formats for

1366
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,319
securely declaring

1367
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:45,160
the endorsements and reference values

1368
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,240
comments we are now open for comments

1369
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,319
and feedback

1370
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,240
so just uh yeah that's actually a

1371
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,200
comment so there's some a symmetry on

1372
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,040
the protocol work

1373
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,760
for the rats charter at the moment

1374
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,599
i'm not a super fan of that but i

1375
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,440
understand why it exists

1376
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,160
so uh um the chart allows for new

1377
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,880
protocols to be

1378
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,359
specified in the working group when it

1379
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,359
comes about through the

1380
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,680
conveyance of evidence from the test of

1381
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,280
the verifier

1382
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,200
and it is talking only about reusing

1383
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,079
existing things when it comes to

1384
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,480
conveying attestation results from the

1385
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,760
verifier

1386
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,680
to the lying party

1387
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,599
um i'm okay with that

1388
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,160
um there is enough

1389
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,040
um text in the charter that says

1390
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,200
sure that will work and i don't think we

1391
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,000
need to new protocols there

1392
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,160
um i just want to say that protocols

1393
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,960
that can convey

1394
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,359
evidence from an attester to a verifier

1395
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,400
could in theory also be used for that so

1396
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,319
they are not they are not literally

1397
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,160
invented for that

1398
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,920
as said by the charter but they invented

1399
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,680
for the other thing so this is like a

1400
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,240
weird loophole how you could invent new

1401
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,160
protocols for the other thing you know

1402
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,440
you recall five was there to begin with

1403
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,920
yeah i understand that and the

1404
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,799
discussion was that we needed the data

1405
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,480
schemas okay

1406
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,319
and i also understand that

1407
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:21,359
yes

1408
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,599
i just want to say that that for example

1409
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,160
2da is a protocol for a test of the

1410
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,440
verifier

1411
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,680
and if that is getting standardized it's

1412
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,119
a protocol

1413
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,640
and then you can apply to the other

1414
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,440
thing

1415
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,920
so the asymmetry in the text

1416
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,760
does not really matter

1417
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,760
because if you did the one thing you can

1418
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,839
do it for the other thing it becomes

1419
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,359
symmetric

1420
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,440
so the asymmetric text in the charter

1421
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,680
does not serve a purpose i think

1422
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,480
but

1423
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,440
again i don't mind that because

1424
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,079
as you just said it doesn't matter so

1425
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,160
that's my only concern on the asymmetry

1426
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,400
and protocol design

1427
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,520
okay

1428
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,760
on the queue we've got kathleen

1429
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,480
and then dave

1430
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,079
hi so um for the first item and sorry i

1431
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,520
didn't get this to the list what's the

1432
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,280
gating function

1433
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,319
for

1434
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,760
a document on extensions and the reason

1435
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,240
i'm asking is because you'll have cases

1436
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,559
where you have to register

1437
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,359
uh things into registries and some might

1438
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,880
require

1439
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,559
um

1440
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,799
might require a document you know into

1441
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,090
cozy and um

1442
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,799
[Music]

1443
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:33,760
uh

1444
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,880
jots

1445
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,839
sorry i'm still really tired

1446
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,760
you're nervous

1447
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,520
function right so that might be the case

1448
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,400
where we publish

1449
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,640
if a claim has to be registered and

1450
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,559
requires a document specification

1451
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,799
required yeah i think that's what six is

1452
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,000
going towards kathleen

1453
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,359
that that we would have a document for

1454
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,920
that format

1455
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,319
is that what you're you're trying to ask

1456
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,960
and and are you asking

1457
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,160
as a chair to the group

1458
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,079
uh

1459
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:13,760
yeah so i guess it doesn't read clearly

1460
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,680
to me

1461
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,720
that i didn't see the connection

1462
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,720
so you mean strictly use cases but use

1463
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,240
cases without a definition or an

1464
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,040
extension okay

1465
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,079
yes

1466
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,480
that that was the intent

1467
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,760
yes

1468
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,119
all right it wasn't entirely clear

1469
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,000
okay

1470
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,280
dave saylor you're in the queue

1471
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,040
uh checking audio can you guys hear me

1472
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,040
yes we can hear you

1473
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,040
all right uh so i got in the key i was

1474
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,880
going to say something very similar to

1475
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,640
what uh hank said

1476
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,960
uh and i think what uh ira just put into

1477
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,880
the chat i think it would be useful to

1478
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,440
clarify 0.5

1479
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,200
yes it was in there before but we kind

1480
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,119
of have an agreement that says we much

1481
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,359
prefer existing protocols where they

1482
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:08,400
exist

1483
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,760
um and so i guess my original uh thought

1484
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,200
that i put in a chat was maybe it should

1485
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,359
be standardized use of interoperable

1486
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,920
protocols but uh maybe even better would

1487
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,880
be to say specifically that uh

1488
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,920
the group um will try to reuse existing

1489
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,160
protocols whenever possible

1490
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,000
right now it's more open-ended that that

1491
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,359
you know people can propose you know

1492
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,880
alternate protocols even if there's

1493
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,799
already a standard one that exists um

1494
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,079
and just being more explicit in the

1495
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,520
charter i think would be useful to say

1496
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,520
really the burden is on uh somebody

1497
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,680
proposing a protocol to say why would

1498
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,680
you not be able to use an existing one

1499
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,520
right and so i'm just suggesting some

1500
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,280
wording that does not preclude

1501
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,520
necessarily new protocols but at least

1502
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,359
raises the burden of of um of proof for

1503
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,359
those proposing it to say okay you can

1504
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:54,640
do one but you've got to be able to say

1505
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,280
why existing ones aren't aren't you

1506
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,799
can't be used in that situation so

1507
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,040
thanks

1508
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,880
thanks dave

1509
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,839
hank so yeah hi this is hank dave do you

1510
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:09,920
think that would put me in any position

1511
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,520
to again argue why tuda has

1512
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,440
a valid point

1513
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,119
if so i would not like to do that

1514
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,520
but if you think it's obvious that tudor

1515
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,760
is a standalone thing because it does

1516
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,760
things differently i'm i'm not i don't

1517
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,079
have a problem with it and just just as

1518
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,079
an individual because i don't like more

1519
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,319
work

1520
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,040
um i can't remember to what extent that

1521
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,599
would classify tuda as a

1522
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:38,480
protocol

1523
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,280
per se but i'm taking you you do um i'd

1524
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,960
have to go back and read it again

1525
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,599
i guess my point is that um

1526
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,040
there's a couple of different legs in

1527
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,200
the architecture document like a

1528
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,119
protocol between a

1529
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,359
a tester and a relying party and then

1530
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,039
there are protocols between say a

1531
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,520
verifier and one of the other two

1532
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,760
and uh protocols between the attester

1533
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,599
and their lying party might be

1534
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,119
pre-existing that you're adding

1535
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,720
attestation to

1536
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,960
and so the goal is to whenever possible

1537
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,960
put attestation into existing protocols

1538
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,359
and do authentication right now but your

1539
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,359
legs that go off to you know an endorser

1540
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,760
or a uh a reference value provider or a

1541
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,760
verifier you know maybe you need new

1542
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,440
ones that might be using you know http

1543
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,880
or something else as a transport and

1544
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,720
those might be okay but trying to reuse

1545
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,039
say a test you're lying party protocols

1546
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,640
um for the horizontal leg and the

1547
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,640
diagrams i think it should be a strong

1548
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,400
bias there

1549
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,359
and so

1550
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,119
but you could be layering things on top

1551
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,039
and so i don't have a specific answer to

1552
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,240
your question

1553
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,119
okay so so just as an additional comment

1554
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,039
to what you just said is i i don't know

1555
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,440
what a test i would rely to a

1556
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,720
convey to a relying party at all

1557
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,520
so

1558
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,680
well for example in the

1559
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,960
in the uh

1560
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,000
uh

1561
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,760
passport model it's conveying

1562
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,440
attestation results right in the

1563
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,960
background check it's containing

1564
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,359
evidence and in the background check of

1565
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:02,720
course neither of the it's just using it

1566
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,480
as a transport right it's it's putting

1567
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,000
evidence over the top of whatever that

1568
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,079
protocol is not that the relying party

1569
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,359
knows that it's evidence right it's just

1570
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:10,799
an opaque blob but it has to pass off to

1571
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:13,440
verify i'm on your background yet yeah i

1572
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,079
think both of you are are oscillating

1573
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,720
but agreeing on the the need for us to

1574
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,520
use the existing protocols just

1575
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,680
with clearance in particular to put

1576
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,039
into point five

1577
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,200
yes with the exception of the tudor

1578
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,119
thing that we are what i'm targeting for

1579
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,920
so if this is in scope fine if somebody

1580
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,039
exer

1581
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,160
assesses this what excluded i'm not fine

1582
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,880
that's very obvious so that's all i have

1583
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,240
okay

1584
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,280
um

1585
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,000
all right so pengling you're in the

1586
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,240
queue

1587
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,000
hello

1588
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,680
yes we can hear you

1589
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,480
yes my question about the number five is

1590
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,520
that

1591
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,880
what layer the protocol will be used

1592
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,960
in transport layer i think the tls will

1593
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,440
be a very good example to use the

1594
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,920
protocol

1595
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,119
i don't know that we've made that

1596
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,839
explicit

1597
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,319
uh i mean that

1598
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,680
if it's a transport layer i think tls

1599
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,480
will be a good example to use in this

1600
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,680
scenario

1601
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,319
yeah so we made that explicit as we said

1602
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:29,280
profiling existing protocols example

1603
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,559
dtls

1604
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:35,200
coab or mud which is a lot of layers

1605
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,599
okay so i think we've set some examples

1606
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,960
in the charter text yeah i oh okay i

1607
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,799
didn't think we called them out explicit

1608
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,520
but yes we

1609
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,039
oh we did

1610
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,440
i stand corrected we did

1611
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,440
hi this is hannes um

1612
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,720
what i hear is

1613
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,559
and i haven't followed that discussion

1614
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:55,440
is

1615
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,359
previously is

1616
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,280
you guys want to restrict what is being

1617
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,200
standardized on the other hand everyone

1618
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,960
who has a specific favorite protocol

1619
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,559
wants to make sure that the dex covers

1620
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,480
what they are have in mind uh which is

1621
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,280
kind of odd you essentially want to

1622
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,160
like

1623
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,960
it feels like well you should label this

1624
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,880
and and just continue start the work

1625
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,839
because otherwise everyone will anyway

1626
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,119
um

1627
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,119
as always people will do what they want

1628
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,960
to do and they will then just change the

1629
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,799
way that or reinterpret the chart and

1630
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,559
the way that it fits their needs well

1631
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,319
and and that gets to the question of

1632
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,880
existing protocols right

1633
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,799
if if we could

1634
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,799
not to be pessimistic but if we continue

1635
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,960
to delay there be maybe a new protocol

1636
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,400
and then we'll say hey we should be

1637
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,640
using that one

1638
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,319
all i'm saying is it's subject to

1639
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:43,760
interpretation

1640
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,960
right

1641
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,799
but but again what i'm trying to come

1642
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:49,520
back to was if you recall when we went

1643
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,440
to charter

1644
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,520
rats in the beginning

1645
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,520
we struggled to get

1646
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,599
the program of work lined up

1647
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,559
and agree on the text which landed us on

1648
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:02,400
those first five

1649
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,640
the discussions in the last few months

1650
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,839
have been

1651
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,079
the notion of how do we do the

1652
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,799
conveyance of um

1653
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,720
other information

1654
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,880
and admittedly to

1655
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,280
to get us to move along faster we we

1656
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,680
added that number six

1657
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,039
um

1658
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:23,920
narrowing the scope to number five or i

1659
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,599
would say tightening the language i

1660
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,440
think is fine

1661
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,559
we have put so i've asked ned to to

1662
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,359
update what's in the github right now

1663
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,079
and so we parenthetically just added you

1664
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,359
know the note

1665
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,880
um

1666
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,520
and the intent is to use existing

1667
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,000
protocols where possible

1668
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,280
so what's interesting was we took a poll

1669
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,880
on the mail list

1670
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,079
and

1671
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,160
there were no dissenting there was

1672
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,039
discussion by lawrence i believe right

1673
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,000
and

1674
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,119
i believe we we tried to do some of the

1675
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,599
methane on the github

1676
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:03,920
um

1677
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,559
i'm thinking we probably need to do

1678
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:07,839
another

1679
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,480
poll and confirmation on the mail list

1680
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,640
given that we've updated

1681
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,879
um

1682
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,319
we just updated the text on the

1683
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,400
proposed charter

1684
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,319
all right did did i just run this out of

1685
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,558
time

1686
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,520
oh we have one minute left

1687
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,640
lawrence it looked like you had a

1688
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,680
comment

1689
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,480
no

1690
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,400
uh

1691
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,760
i'll only one comment um

1692
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,200
yeah this is lawrence um uh

1693
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,640
most of my comments were around whether

1694
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,720
or not eat was

1695
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,160
going to be

1696
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,880
discouraged as an attestation results

1697
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,720
protocol because there was seemed a lot

1698
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,640
of consensus around that

1699
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,160
and i was hoping for a little bit of an

1700
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,000
adjustment in the wording to be clear

1701
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,599
that

1702
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,160
we're not excluding

1703
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,799
uh eat as attestation results and that

1704
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:05,599
we're we have an expansive or basically

1705
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,599
we have an expansive view of attestation

1706
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,319
results not a narrow one so so that was

1707
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,000
that was my main concern if i look

1708
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,119
around

1709
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,920
at the architecture the charter other

1710
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,000
things i mean it's it's not as strong as

1711
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,799
i'd like but it's reasonable

1712
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:23,198
we do best effort so that we can get the

1713
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:25,920
actual work moving forward

1714
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,359
i don't think we would be precluding

1715
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,279
anything lawrence there yeah i think

1716
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,640
that's what this is saying

1717
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,238
um i think there's also another

1718
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:33,920
distortion item under exactly that the

1719
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,238
next session

1720
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,679
if i'm not mistaken about the

1721
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,479
attestation result scope and such so

1722
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,880
that would tie into that

1723
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,600
correct yes yeah so so i will postpone

1724
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,920
that that that content discussion and

1725
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,359
then we can bring it up in the next

1726
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,399
session

1727
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,759
yeah okay

1728
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:54,960
okay

1729
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,479
so um

1730
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,319
can i just get a show of hand i mean

1731
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,920
we're we're gonna

1732
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,040
shoot i have to do another poll

1733
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,479
um well we're out of time so

1734
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,719
why don't i just

1735
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,279
go back to the uh

1736
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,560
yeah

1737
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,399
um

1738
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,640
well i mean we're gonna have to confirm

1739
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,560
things on the mail list anyway

1740
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,880
so um

1741
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,759
please i'm strongly

1742
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,679
requesting that you guys read through

1743
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,920
the proposed text i will do another call

1744
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,839
for support for the rechartering of this

1745
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:35,198
text um

1746
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:38,000
and we'll go from there on the mail list

1747
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,520
okay

1748
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,279
reasonable

1749
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,960
okay um next up i believe we're going

1750
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,000
through milestones

1751
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,120
can you put those up

1752
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,120
so i'll fall on this one we've been

1753
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,080
remiss

1754
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,920
we have actually been updating the

1755
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,080
milestones

1756
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,400
we are behind

1757
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,440
we need to make sure that we can tighten

1758
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,360
the scope of some of the work that we're

1759
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,199
doing just so that we can move them

1760
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,600
forward towards publication

1761
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,520
if there's more work to be done i don't

1762
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,480
think we are excluding new drafts

1763
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,840
to come in um

1764
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,719
but we wanted to review this and so

1765
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,920
part of the discussion

1766
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,400
there's some updates that are

1767
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,440
interesting oh yeah roman just updated

1768
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,879
it uh can you share it

1769
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,600
so we wanted to go through the

1770
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,080
milestones also to get an idea for for

1771
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,080
new added ones but given that we're not

1772
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,199
adopting you charter texts

1773
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,120
um we'll uh

1774
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,880
we'll hold off on the new ones roman

1775
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,560
you're in the queue thanks ditto

1776
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,159
hi uh yes i want to just uh kind of

1777
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:57,760
continue on with the discussion that

1778
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,600
you're narrating about what's in the

1779
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,159
milestones uh i will say i have i saw

1780
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:03,760
there were some pending milestones i

1781
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,400
approved some of them i did not release

1782
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,440
kind of some of them so that's why

1783
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,640
you may notice that things are in a

1784
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,080
halfway state based on the edits we're

1785
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,239
making and i think it's uh it's all

1786
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,400
informed by this charter conversation my

1787
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,400
meta feedback uh would be as we're

1788
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,840
thinking about milestones is first of

1789
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,520
course we'll need milestones for the

1790
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,320
recharger activity but i would really

1791
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,480
caution the working group to make sure

1792
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,960
that we're pipelining the work correctly

1793
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,960
that we actually in fact have enough

1794
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,600
energy to kick off and start everything

1795
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,360
uh you know i i don't want to say at the

1796
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,040
same time but you know we can finish

1797
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,719
kind of all the work and we're not in a

1798
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,679
situation where we uh fan out we start a

1799
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,080
lot of things and we lumber

1800
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,239
we lumber slowly toward completion so if

1801
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,360
the working group would want to think

1802
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,159
about waves or sprints of related work

1803
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,159
we want to work on this first then

1804
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,000
another kind of toronto work that may

1805
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,920
make things a little bit more productive

1806
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,920
but i leave it to the initial proposals

1807
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,560
to figure that out

1808
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:05,440
i like that idea thanks roman

1809
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,480
okay so um

1810
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,840
i don't know that there's going to be

1811
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,080
much to discuss on the milestones but we

1812
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,600
just wanted to show you that we we are

1813
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,960
i can't read um

1814
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,080
you want to go through them i can go

1815
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,000
through them yeah yeah

1816
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,360
so

1817
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,760
in most cases we had

1818
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,080
work progress without updating the

1819
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,159
milestones so the recent flurry of

1820
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,960
activity is essentially to go back and

1821
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,360
provide um

1822
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,760
milestones that reflect the the actual

1823
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,440
status of the various

1824
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,480
um

1825
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,760
drafts

1826
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,280
uh and so

1827
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,199
uh several of those that are currently

1828
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,120
in every direct review are

1829
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,719
fit into that bucket

1830
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,400
uh and then there

1831
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,760
were a couple of

1832
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,920
uh milestones that were submitted that

1833
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,800
were in anticipation of the change to

1834
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,880
the working group charter

1835
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,040
um so those are

1836
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,120
i think those are in your q q roman

1837
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,239
they're pending yeah

1838
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,199
any comments or feedback

1839
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:23,920
nope

1840
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,560
i don't see anybody on the queue

1841
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,640
so i guess we can continue to move

1842
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,040
forward

1843
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,280
um what's next

1844
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,239
taxonomy eat attestation and results

1845
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,239
taxonomy

1846
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,040
so how long do i do i have for this i

1847
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,120
was little uh you asked for 30 minutes

1848
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,040
yeah okay

1849
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,360
so i mean

1850
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,199
if the chairs were nice we can give you

1851
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:06,159
more than 30 minutes

1852
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,679
oh the chairs were already already nice

1853
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,199
for giving me 30 minutes so thank you

1854
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,040
thank you for that i'm often accused of

1855
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,840
not being that nice so

1856
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,199
actually you won't give it to him

1857
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,400
now this is to say

1858
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,400
you know we've allocated 30 minutes but

1859
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,760
we're actually

1860
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,040
we gave some time back because um

1861
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,800
the charter and milestones went quicker

1862
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,719
than we thought okay

1863
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,880
i don't have 30 minutes of slides or 30

1864
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,400
minutes of talking to do myself that's

1865
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,719
for sure um

1866
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,880
mostly uh i wanted to have some good

1867
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,520
discussion about attestation results and

1868
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,040
kind of some of the framing around

1869
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,199
attestation results what we're trying to

1870
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:48,480
achieve here

1871
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,480
so i just have a few slides to kind of

1872
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,040
introduce some things and then i just

1873
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,719
like facilitate some discussion to try

1874
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:55,520
to

1875
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,800
back and forth it seemed like it was a

1876
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,840
little

1877
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,000
uh you know difficult some ways on the

1878
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,080
mailing list i would try some of this so

1879
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,719
uh next slide

1880
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,239
so um one of the things i really a point

1881
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:09,760
that seems really important to me is

1882
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,560
that attestation results are for a full

1883
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,560
range of security strengths

1884
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,560
so that ranges from

1885
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,719
a piece of hardware

1886
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,800
that is designed it's not a tpm it's

1887
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,360
designed just to provide authenticated a

1888
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,840
tested device identity maybe all the way

1889
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,679
to the rp so no measurements no software

1890
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:32,960
so the no tpm so i think that's

1891
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,040
that's a use case and i think we want to

1892
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,000
be

1893
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,080
accommodating that use case in both

1894
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,199
evidence and results

1895
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:43,760
another use case is um

1896
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,640
uh

1897
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,880
simple uncertified software so

1898
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,960
attestation like is built into an

1899
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,199
android app like a fido implementation

1900
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,840
inside an android app so it's all

1901
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,800
software there's no tpm there's no

1902
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,560
not much really going on to measure it

1903
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,040
can't really measure itself so but it is

1904
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,440
a form of attestation right we see we

1905
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,280
see implementations like that

1906
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,560
you know fido so and then there's

1907
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,400
everything between which is kind of

1908
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,239
where we're spending a lot of our time

1909
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:11,199
you know

1910
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,000
on things like uh tpm and tees you know

1911
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,520
without a station there and that's that

1912
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,360
is i think that's the right place to be

1913
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,520
spending a lot of time but um

1914
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,400
we can't focus just on that

1915
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,960
next slide

1916
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,199
so system architectures um

1917
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,800
so i think we need to think about

1918
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,560
attestation results for a full set of

1919
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,960
system architectures so again

1920
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,040
purpose-built hardware

1921
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,440
that just does attestation there's no uh

1922
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,360
software in it at all it's not and it's

1923
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,760
not a tpm

1924
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,800
again app-based so the attestation is

1925
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,600
implemented in java or swift or python

1926
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,440
or something like that so

1927
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,040
no measurements just some simple

1928
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,600
attestation

1929
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,080
and then everything in between

1930
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,880
so uh and actually uh i think back in

1931
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,440
august there was a discussion

1932
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,880
on the list about adding 0.5

1933
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,760
to

1934
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,760
the principles for ar 4si and

1935
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,040
they basically said all that but

1936
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,159
and i think there was agreement on the

1937
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,440
list to add

1938
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,840
this as a principle these two things as

1939
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,760
a principle for ar-4si but i don't think

1940
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,960
it actually got incorporated

1941
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,080
um okay so that's uh

1942
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,560
so so i do think when you are

1943
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,159
incorporating all of this it does change

1944
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:35,280
how you think about ar

1945
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,159
um next

1946
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,360
yeah go ahead

1947
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,320
um

1948
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,040
so

1949
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,719
there's a thing

1950
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:47,679
adjustation results are intrinsically

1951
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,920
tied to evidence

1952
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,480
that's correct

1953
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:54,800
well that's a very general statement and

1954
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,000
i don't really quite know where you're

1955
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,120
going with that but yeah it's a trap

1956
01:17:59,120 --> 01:17:59,920
okay

1957
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,080
so

1958
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,440
let's know

1959
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,000
so if evidence becomes stay at the

1960
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,120
station results become stale there come

1961
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,040
somehow a

1962
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,239
ghostly entangles right um um you don't

1963
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,400
know apparently because the the the

1964
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,080
technology around that you know that the

1965
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,640
nationalization result is stale depends

1966
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,800
on the somehow knowing that the evidence

1967
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,560
becomes stable now

1968
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,480
evidence not known to you and mostly so

1969
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,640
that that's in general the the challenge

1970
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,719
of rats so now you're saying

1971
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:31,679
um

1972
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,040
that everything that produces evidence

1973
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,760
uh can relate to attestation results and

1974
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,600
now what i would like to highlight is

1975
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,440
that

1976
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,800
the testing environments in the testers

1977
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,320
create evidence

1978
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,080
that's a first

1979
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,040
and then

1980
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,679
the testing environments

1981
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,640
can't just be signing fools

1982
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,159
i think that's obvious

1983
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,320
right yeah yeah so so but if you say

1984
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,840
everything can be in a testing

1985
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,440
environment by saying everything is in a

1986
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,040
tester

1987
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,640
it can be a signing fool i think that's

1988
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,560
a contradiction

1989
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,719
so how do you make sure

1990
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:09,520
that

1991
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,600
whatever creates the evidence in the

1992
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,360
tester and i think it's always of course

1993
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,600
the testing environment is not a signing

1994
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,679
fool

1995
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,800
i mean my answer is so

1996
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,960
when well hold on we've got eric on the

1997
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,440
queue as well

1998
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,600
can i answer that yeah no i just saw

1999
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,000
hannah's coming up i wanted okay

2000
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,719
so

2001
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:33,679
i'm when i say uh go back to uh if you

2002
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,280
go back a slide please when i say system

2003
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,800
architectures and security levels i

2004
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,920
didn't say that these were

2005
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,080
signing fools or attesting fools i just

2006
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,000
said you can implement them in all these

2007
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,840
different ways it's this is just

2008
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,440
implementation

2009
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,920
um and you know sorting out who's the

2010
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,760
fool and who's not the full that's

2011
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,640
really the job of the verifier right and

2012
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,360
so

2013
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,440
some and i mean you could be a verifying

2014
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,080
fool too but

2015
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:03,840
but assuming we don't have verifying

2016
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,639
pools it's the job of the verifier to

2017
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:08,800
say what it is and and they may say like

2018
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,840
okay this this attestation came from a

2019
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,880
python you know on a something or other

2020
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,520
and

2021
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,239
i it's not very good and then you can

2022
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,679
use it if you want but it's not very

2023
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,840
good and so that's

2024
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
that's what i'd say all right okay

2025
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,800
thank you

2026
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,679
hank says thumbs up

2027
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,880
okay adding one yeah adding one thing to

2028
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,520
the discussion uh that relates to the

2029
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,440
previous discussion

2030
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,600
it's important to remember that you can

2031
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,520
sign stuff and

2032
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:43,360
be sending it to or lying party

2033
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,280
the physical device

2034
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,239
and that's okay uh dave taylor really

2035
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,560
did a good job of educating the our

2036
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,080
forza people

2037
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,080
that the relying party also has a

2038
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,840
verifier

2039
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,600
in most cases because it has to

2040
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,600
interpret the evidence

2041
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,520
as well on the passport model is

2042
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,159
something that was evaluated before

2043
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,239
so just because something sent to our

2044
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,760
lying party

2045
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,880
does not

2046
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,880
make it

2047
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,600
at the station results it has to be

2048
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,080
evidence that's evaluated

2049
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,199
uh

2050
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:20,080
to become attestation results

2051
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,000
and so we really have to remember that

2052
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,440
split role

2053
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,400
where the verifier if it does do some

2054
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,080
kind of ai type lookup or other types of

2055
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,080
functions on the evidence

2056
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:32,800
that

2057
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,560
just because it's received by the

2058
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,639
relying party device

2059
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:40,560
does not make it out to station results

2060
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,400
yeah

2061
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,400
maybe let's go for some more discussion

2062
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,320
i'm not sure i agree with that one but

2063
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,719
honest

2064
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,480
it's not even really something to

2065
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,560
discuss because it's base architecture

2066
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,040
that the relying party and

2067
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,880
uh the verifier are often co-resident

2068
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,560
in the the

2069
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,080
passport model so i don't even think

2070
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,080
it's something that can be discussed

2071
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:04,960
unless you want to argue the

2072
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,600
architecture

2073
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,960
hi this honest um i think both eric and

2074
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,760
hank um responded to the slide in a way

2075
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,920
that was completely unrelated to what's

2076
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,199
on the slide uh uh so which is uh which

2077
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:22,080
with great points uh but

2078
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,960
but if uh in my discussions which are

2079
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,679
unrelated to rats with uh the various

2080
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:28,560
people

2081
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,760
there's

2082
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,239
always an attempt to make a judgment

2083
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,400
about the security of a system that they

2084
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,920
are describing and

2085
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,360
interestingly

2086
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,360
it shows up actually very nicely in

2087
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,239
these and these different categories um

2088
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:43,120
and

2089
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,679
there is often uh

2090
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:47,920
um for many people like there's an

2091
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,320
assumption on what they consider the

2092
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,560
threshold to be

2093
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,560
what the minimum buy is

2094
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,080
and of course there are some preferences

2095
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,239
and biases that go along with it and i

2096
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,360
think

2097
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,639
i hear you um learn saying that

2098
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:05,040
you have these different models um but

2099
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,120
you're not trying to make a judgment of

2100
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,159
whether that's good or not um right and

2101
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,080
and i think that's probably the right

2102
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,560
way uh sort of like leave that policy

2103
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,719
decision out there and let someone

2104
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:19,120
decide but be aware that there is

2105
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,719
obviously

2106
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,080
a spectrum

2107
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,000
and those deploying the solution need to

2108
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,560
make a decision about what

2109
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,159
they consider

2110
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:30,960
useful and what which one not and it

2111
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,480
it i think it

2112
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,639
also then boils down to

2113
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,120
in in context of rad not just

2114
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,600
about like judging the overall results

2115
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,400
but actually individual values within

2116
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,840
inside uh

2117
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,120
of a claim as well so for example um you

2118
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,480
take a

2119
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,800
a security level claim uh

2120
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,199
sort of a lifestyle life cycle state

2121
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:54,719
claim so typically if you have some

2122
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,719
hardware id in there there's a life

2123
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:59,120
cycle state associated with it but if

2124
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,880
it's in certain states

2125
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,560
any information for example if it's in a

2126
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,360
debug state you can you can have a

2127
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,120
perfectly secure solution but you can

2128
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,800
then switch it into a debug state

2129
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,960
different forms of debug state if it's

2130
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,960
in a certain level you cannot really

2131
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,280
judge make any useful judgment about the

2132
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,960
data you get when it's in that debug

2133
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,719
state because you could modify any of

2134
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,719
the values then

2135
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,239
and

2136
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,920
obviously someone needs to be mindful

2137
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,320
about those aspects and in practice that

2138
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,440
will be

2139
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,400
a challenge i could imagine in

2140
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,960
in deployments so i don't know if you uh

2141
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,880
lawrence if you plan to document these

2142
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,040
different levels uh and of course for

2143
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,440
example i wouldn't go there to be honest

2144
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,280
because it's very difficult uh many

2145
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,480
people tried

2146
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,000
um and it's part of us of certification

2147
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,120
schemes

2148
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,440
because they additionally they try to

2149
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,199
define different security levels and

2150
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:52,480
then

2151
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,120
match that up with ways to verify that

2152
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,719
to demonstrate that i'm actually meeting

2153
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,719
that security level um

2154
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,639
so

2155
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:01,920
um

2156
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,239
what i'm trying to get with this is it's

2157
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:06,320
it's difficult even for us technical

2158
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,159
people to really

2159
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,880
um talk about this without a lot of

2160
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,480
emotions because we have our own

2161
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,560
preference of where we put the bar

2162
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,600
on like i personally i'm not too happy

2163
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,639
about level this that level two part and

2164
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,080
i have a different perspective on level

2165
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,239
one of course but i'm sure everyone in

2166
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,000
the room is different

2167
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,920
so i don't know how you best want to

2168
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,320
convey that so that people in

2169
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,040
in future discussions who are not part

2170
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,199
of the group or iedf in general

2171
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:36,960
will then not stumble over the same

2172
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,639
issue

2173
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,480
yeah i'd like to respond to a couple of

2174
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,719
things there um okay uh and then the

2175
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,400
next thing the q so

2176
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,480
i spent a lot of years started out as a

2177
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,800
software guy and then i got a job doing

2178
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,120
some hardware and it really opened my

2179
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,360
eyes about like what's what's going on

2180
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,360
in terms of hardware i mean to me

2181
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,360
hardware was just a cpu you just ran

2182
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,360
stuff on then i started understanding

2183
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,880
what's really going in the hardware and

2184
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,400
how variable it is and how you attack

2185
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,840
hardware and all sorts of stuff like

2186
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,239
that then i spent a couple years

2187
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,280
designing

2188
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,239
certification levels for fido and that

2189
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:12,159
really deepened my knowledge you know

2190
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:14,159
understanding common criteria and how

2191
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:16,239
people you know actually

2192
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:19,440
uh evaluate hardware security so i mean

2193
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,639
so

2194
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,480
you know 15 years ago i would have been

2195
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,080
like i don't really understand this

2196
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,480
hardware stuff and it's just like it's

2197
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,280
we just need to do a good job now i see

2198
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,239
security as very as a huge sliding scale

2199
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,120
from

2200
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,400
a whole bunch of

2201
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,960
over a whole range and my main point

2202
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,679
here the thing i'm really after is that

2203
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,199
we can't

2204
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:43,600
narrow in on one security level in rats

2205
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,400
we should not do that all the protocols

2206
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,159
i mean if you want to design a specific

2207
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:49,920
protocol for a thing then it then that's

2208
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,560
fine design it and call it out as this

2209
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,199
is just for this security level or just

2210
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:58,560
it's not a universal solution but

2211
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,880
rats should be designing for universal

2212
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,960
security any core protocol so eat is

2213
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,199
definitely that way he definitely thinks

2214
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:08,719
about the whole range of security from

2215
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,120
the weakest to the strongest whether you

2216
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,320
and you don't have to use it for all of

2217
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,840
those things it's just that's what we're

2218
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,600
trying to accommodate

2219
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,600
can i can i just put a pause on that

2220
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,480
just

2221
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,000
you know

2222
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,840
having been a systems architect for a

2223
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,600
long time

2224
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,080
trying to suit everybody

2225
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,760
you'll never be you're never going to be

2226
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,239
able to please everybody yes and every

2227
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:31,199
design

2228
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:34,960
so i think as a goal that's laudable

2229
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:35,760
right

2230
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,679
but i think some of the work that you've

2231
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:38,880
seen

2232
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,679
have been very specific to some hardware

2233
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:43,840
platforms or architectures and we made

2234
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,560
sure that you know i'm speaking to the

2235
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,520
child one which is more tpm specific as

2236
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,239
an example that's fine

2237
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:55,120
i mean i i don't i i know it's hard i

2238
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,400
don't think we should just give up

2239
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,000
because we can't

2240
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,920
you know on the get-go i mean i think

2241
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,280
eat is doing okay at this full range so

2242
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,560
i think there's some possibility there

2243
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,080
and i just went up

2244
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,080
and we're recognizing char as tpm

2245
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,560
specific the question the real question

2246
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,280
for me is is where does ar-4si fit in

2247
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,280
this is it universal yeah for all the

2248
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,360
levels or is it narrow to a specific one

2249
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,600
i want another comment on hannah's

2250
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,800
statement that

2251
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,440
um you should somebody that decide if

2252
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,880
this is good or not

2253
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,800
it's that's a literal quote you just

2254
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,920
said right

2255
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,320
from coming from the target of every

2256
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,560
asian that is the attester

2257
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,960
so so you should let someone that

2258
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,480
decided that's good or bad that's what

2259
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,000
you said right

2260
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,080
that's a verifier

2261
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,639
that's a policy on there right so it's

2262
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:45,600
defined who and what and when will

2263
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,440
decide this in the architecture i think

2264
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,120
that's very important to sound because

2265
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,880
when you said it was like

2266
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,120
some miracle occurs but no

2267
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,960
the architecture really decides this and

2268
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,800
the very fair decisions and that's why

2269
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,960
this is defined through attaching

2270
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,320
results and i think this is to be

2271
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,480
discussed right here right now

2272
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,600
so yeah

2273
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,320
uh this is honest again so

2274
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,080
the architecture is a very abstract

2275
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,679
thing of course in the end it's uh

2276
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,120
people need to decide that's what i'm

2277
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,800
trying to get to like people need to

2278
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,320
make some decisions on what they find

2279
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,560
acceptable and what's not okay

2280
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,560
but those are the people later who

2281
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,520
deploy the technology is different from

2282
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,040
us here standards people deciding that

2283
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:29,120
only only on the the lowest one um

2284
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,960
the level three or whatever you call it

2285
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,360
is the one we want to focus on or we

2286
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,760
want to focus only on a dbm

2287
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,840
um slash uh i think we could do that too

2288
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,320
and some organization did that um

2289
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,960
but i'm i'm i'm there more with lauren

2290
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,080
saying that

2291
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,000
um support a wider spectrum because

2292
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,760
needless to say like you guys talk a lot

2293
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,239
about dbms because that's what you use i

2294
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:54,159
would want to have my uh our stuff

2295
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:55,440
included as well

2296
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,920
um and probably dara wants yet something

2297
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,360
else um

2298
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,159
and

2299
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,360
and so

2300
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,920
being content yeah

2301
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,920
um there is just here for the warm room

2302
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,000
uh but

2303
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,239
you get the point i i understand your

2304
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,920
point and i'm i'm going back through the

2305
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,920
charter i don't think the charter has

2306
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,320
precluded that right yes it's not clear

2307
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,159
to me that the architecture has

2308
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:20,560
precluded that either harness

2309
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,320
so i'm just trying to understand and

2310
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,199
frame the discussion right because

2311
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:27,440
and i'm not saying it's a bad discussion

2312
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,679
i'm trying to understand the goal

2313
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,679
because now you point into a specific

2314
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:32,800
draft

2315
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,560
and so if you're pointing to a specific

2316
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,480
draft perhaps and sorry i'm just very

2317
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,520
target fixated of you know

2318
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,920
is it that you're asking that draft to

2319
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,360
be more precise in its scope

2320
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,920
of where it lies

2321
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,639
or are you just objecting

2322
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:54,480
in its approach

2323
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,040
i'm well i've written extensively on the

2324
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,920
mailing list about ar 4si

2325
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,159
and i don't think we're done yet i just

2326
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:03,840
wanted to and i don't think we will

2327
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,000
finish today i

2328
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,159
i just wanted to have this open

2329
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,000
discussion about the framing here

2330
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,880
exactly

2331
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,960
and that's fair so and i have to say

2332
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,000
again

2333
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,280
um

2334
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:18,000
what i just said is independent of the

2335
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,080
assumptions on that slide

2336
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,080
all these are acceptable

2337
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,400
what i'm saying is that the decision

2338
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,560
made by someone

2339
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,600
is located at a very very defined

2340
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,239
not abstract not vague but very

2341
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:35,520
well-defined role in the architecture

2342
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,280
and that is the verifier

2343
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,040
if your policy says

2344
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,880
all of this is okay

2345
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,440
it says and if you don't agree with that

2346
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,000
that i think is the problem so that is

2347
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,360
the problem we have to discuss here

2348
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,679
because the verifier will tell you pure

2349
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:53,120
hw everything that's a policy decision

2350
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,199
and the only the policy basic decision

2351
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:56,840
maker here in this architecture is a

2352
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,199
verifier developing party then can make

2353
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,679
sense of the assessment

2354
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:03,520
the result that is created by the

2355
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,080
verifier that's fine and then

2356
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,239
i just want to point out policy of you

2357
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:11,440
can define the expectations but defining

2358
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,920
policy is out of scope yes and that it

2359
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,520
and that is the better the miracle

2360
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,000
occurs that that hana said because some

2361
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,719
people define something we don't express

2362
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:24,400
how but it's enforced by a single role

2363
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,639
in the architecture that is very very

2364
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:28,719
defined and not ambiguous and not

2365
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:31,280
abstract and that is a verifier and if

2366
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,520
you are contesting that

2367
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,920
that i think has to be very spelled out

2368
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,400
because the architecture is done at the

2369
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,360
moment

2370
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,639
if you didn't agree with this in the

2371
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:43,280
last five years that is a little bit

2372
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,080
curious so let me explain

2373
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,000
my comment on that sure

2374
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,080
i just want to recognize brendan is also

2375
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,840
in the queue so go ahead and then we'll

2376
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,800
let go so here's my example um

2377
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,840
uh i'm clearing a uh i'm a bank clearing

2378
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,120
a uh 100 000 transaction i want it to be

2379
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,639
done with something that's common

2380
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,320
criteria certified

2381
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,440
i'm a bank uh clearing a 50 cent

2382
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,920
transaction i really don't care

2383
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,679
if it's an android app

2384
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:12,560
so

2385
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,600
as the relying party the bank in this

2386
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,840
case is deciding something about

2387
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,600
security level and they're deciding it

2388
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,199
in the context of the transaction

2389
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:26,880
so the verifier i don't see the verifier

2390
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:27,760
as

2391
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:28,800
uh

2392
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,199
doing things like

2393
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,840
deciding whether a transaction is good

2394
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,040
because we don't want the verifier

2395
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,719
involved in the transaction amounts or

2396
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,000
who the people are or what country

2397
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,600
they're in or anything like that the

2398
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,760
verifier is about verifying

2399
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,719
the

2400
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,480
the hardware and the software and the

2401
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,560
device it's not about application

2402
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,320
specific stuff

2403
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,679
so

2404
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:52,239
i think we will have verifiers that are

2405
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:53,120
just

2406
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,199
about sorting out uh android apps one

2407
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:56,639
android app from another and we will

2408
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:58,159
have verifiers that are about sorting

2409
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,639
out um secure elements one from another

2410
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:02,719
we will have verifiers that can sort out

2411
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:05,520
android apps from that so the verifier

2412
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,639
has a role

2413
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:08,719
a big role a super important role a

2414
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,960
critical role but so does the relying

2415
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,159
party

2416
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:13,679
so it's not the job of the verifier to

2417
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:15,760
make the final decision it's the rolling

2418
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:18,080
party that makes the final decision and

2419
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,639
they are the end user uh and consumer of

2420
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:23,920
attestation so we have to serve them

2421
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,719
okay

2422
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:27,120
nice brendan go ahead brendan you've

2423
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,520
been patiently waiting

2424
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,440
sorry all right um

2425
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,760
so so this took me a while to wrap my

2426
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,000
head around and i went through the the

2427
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,320
same um the same cycle that i i think

2428
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,960
you're going through uh so maybe i can

2429
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,760
offer my my insight on on how this all

2430
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,880
fits together

2431
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,400
um i was looking at this from a firmware

2432
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,719
attestation point of view and a firmware

2433
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,960
update point of view and when i first

2434
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,159
approached this uh this the the rats

2435
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,320
architecture i was thinking about it in

2436
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,679
terms of

2437
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:01,920
you know an entity that needs to verify

2438
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,840
which firmware is running on a device

2439
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,639
and a separate entity that says that the

2440
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:08,320
report it gets back from a device is

2441
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,960
trustworthy now that to me looks like

2442
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,760
two separate roles one relying party and

2443
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,560
one

2444
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,679
uh verifier but i have finally got it

2445
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,440
through my head that this is in fact

2446
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:22,239
three entities you have two verifiers

2447
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:26,239
and a relying party so what you have is

2448
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:28,639
a verifier who says yes this result is

2449
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:30,960
trustworthy a separate verifier that

2450
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,960
says yes indeed this is the version of

2451
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,800
firmware that it should be running and

2452
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,480
finally you have the relying party that

2453
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,480
says okay both of these guys said it's

2454
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,960
okay so now i believe you mm-hmm

2455
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,639
yeah good sounds good i think what

2456
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,280
you're looking at is exactly that same

2457
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,480
hierarchy you've got your bank that has

2458
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,119
multiple verifiers one of which has the

2459
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:53,280
role of selecting which other verifier

2460
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,440
to trust

2461
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,400
i want to violently agree with brendan

2462
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,080
and and lawrence we've had this

2463
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,239
discussion please listen

2464
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,560
and i'm saying this respectfully because

2465
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,960
dave thaler did educate us before

2466
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,400
during the architecture that the

2467
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,560
verifier is embedded in the relying

2468
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,040
party it's a actually not something

2469
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,960
pretty about the architecture

2470
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,119
but you have to talk about attestation

2471
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,199
results as coming

2472
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,119
to our lying party even if they're

2473
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:26,560
co-resident

2474
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,760
it is not at the station results

2475
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,920
just because it's sent over to the same

2476
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:36,360
physical device it's the relying party

2477
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:44,880
okay this is uh diego speaking again

2478
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,119
i remember in the good old days when we

2479
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:48,560
were dealing with

2480
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,000
identity federations in academic space

2481
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,920
we ended up talking about something i

2482
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,440
mean the different uh um usages of the

2483
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,280
of the identities and the quality of the

2484
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,400
attributes and the sources of these

2485
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,159
attributes etc

2486
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:05,760
and people ended up with the concept of

2487
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,880
a level of assurance that is

2488
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,840
what you want to verify depending on the

2489
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,199
transaction whether we are talking about

2490
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:14,719
one hundred thousand dollars or we are

2491
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:17,520
talking about two cents

2492
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,679
just a suggestion that might be that

2493
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:21,440
precisely when going about which

2494
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,119
elements in the architecture could do

2495
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:24,480
what um

2496
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,719
and what kind of uh of uh

2497
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:29,119
of token could be useful or used or the

2498
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,600
the several steps of verification might

2499
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,320
be that now that we are with the charter

2500
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,679
someone's

2501
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:38,239
someone could write a draft on level of

2502
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:41,839
assurance or how to express them

2503
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:44,719
i would say that the the dloa's claim is

2504
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:45,760
kind of

2505
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,440
because that gets the certification and

2506
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,520
the dlla's claim actually is in that

2507
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,000
direction

2508
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,840
yeah similar to lawrence and and i think

2509
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:59,199
eric also uh repeated that as well as

2510
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:02,320
brendan i think we

2511
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,920
despite the

2512
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,840
initial differences i think we actually

2513
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,080
talked about the same stuff uh

2514
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,760
and have the same view i've witnessed

2515
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,239
the same debates in fido with regards to

2516
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:15,600
these uh sort of like multi-stage

2517
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,920
decision making processes

2518
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:18,880
um

2519
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,159
the question then is is that really

2520
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:23,600
documented well in the architecture

2521
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,760
document which i hadn't had now time to

2522
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,239
check uh and that's

2523
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,880
and maybe maybe it is uh

2524
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,199
but but maybe that's what the area where

2525
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:34,719
the disconnect is

2526
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:36,480
and there's the idealization that

2527
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:39,199
there's one single body to verify

2528
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,280
uh somewhere totally separate from the

2529
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,400
others uh that making the decision uh

2530
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,679
and then there's the relying party who

2531
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,920
just eats whatever it's getting uh being

2532
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:48,880
served

2533
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,119
uh and what i hear is it's actually more

2534
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:53,760
nuanced than that uh

2535
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,400
well if i recall it was it was it is

2536
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,239
documented in the architecture the

2537
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:01,280
question is based on the interpretation

2538
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,280
so again right

2539
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,519
um

2540
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,840
yeah the i think the architecture has

2541
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,800
has compound attesters exactly described

2542
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,560
in detail it does not have compound

2543
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:13,760
verifiers

2544
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,280
concept of uh

2545
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,159
collapsing roles on entities it just

2546
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:19,520
just there but that's different maybe

2547
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,760
from a composite that's different from a

2548
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,760
composite verifier i think

2549
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,119
um actually the composite verifier is a

2550
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:29,360
co-located air verifier

2551
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:30,480
and you can

2552
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,520
verify the verifiers with other things

2553
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,800
so so so there has been extreme pushback

2554
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,199
in the last two years on being more

2555
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:41,040
precise on that

2556
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,960
that is why we just

2557
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,119
boiled it down to a

2558
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:48,320
generic composition capability which has

2559
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:51,679
the obvious choice of co-locating

2560
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:53,679
verifier roles of the relying party

2561
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:56,719
rolls and it by no account ever says you

2562
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:58,719
can just have one verifier

2563
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:02,719
because there were some i would say um

2564
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,400
there was some pushback

2565
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,280
on

2566
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,280
on

2567
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,760
i think there's a difference between uh

2568
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,320
combined roles into a sim uh single

2569
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,159
entity versus what we have been just

2570
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:29,679
talking about uh where there's a

2571
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,239
multi-stage uh decision process

2572
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,880
or um kind of call it nested call it uh

2573
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,760
sequential or i don't know uh

2574
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,000
i think there's

2575
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,239
i mean i'm sensing some discomfort and

2576
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:44,480
and i'm trying to figure out

2577
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,040
where the clarification needs to lie

2578
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,159
because

2579
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:50,080
we debated some of this during the

2580
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,840
architecture

2581
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,040
hank one conversation please

2582
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,480
um

2583
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,440
and

2584
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,840
i thought we were staring towards

2585
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:00,880
the a

2586
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,440
like the a4 rsi

2587
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,280
draft

2588
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,760
but from the abstract i guess i'm

2589
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,719
looking at hanas right i thought some of

2590
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:12,080
this

2591
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:15,840
had been articulated perhaps not well

2592
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,760
i'm looking at you in the architecture

2593
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,159
draft

2594
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:21,840
or interpretation

2595
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:22,719
right

2596
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:25,840
i mean i i would say when for me relying

2597
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,840
poly po relying

2598
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,679
party policy

2599
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:31,520
takes into account the application the

2600
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,080
domain specific stuff like is this am i

2601
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,280
letting this thing on the network what's

2602
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,119
the transaction map is am i verifying a

2603
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,639
fingerprint or

2604
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:41,119
something like that the the verifier

2605
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:43,360
policy is all about device integrity and

2606
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,360
device trustworthiness so that's where i

2607
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,000
mean that's where how i pull them apart

2608
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,159
uh you know one is one is application

2609
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:52,400
specific and one is really the the

2610
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:56,719
domain of verifying the device

2611
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:00,960
um nancy i was i was merely sitting here

2612
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,320
and trying to make sense out of the

2613
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,239
discussions reading through some of the

2614
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:05,920
the emails and trying to understand like

2615
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,000
where's the disconnect and yeah that's

2616
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,560
sort of my from that discussion and from

2617
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:11,280
from

2618
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,960
uh some of the list discussions i had

2619
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,960
read um

2620
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,960
maybe maybe that is the disconnect but

2621
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,960
uh i would have to re-read the document

2622
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,960
to confirm and maybe i don't know maybe

2623
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,800
it's somewhat completely different

2624
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,119
okay thanks

2625
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:26,880
all right how much time do i get we got

2626
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,960
left

2627
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,960
um a couple minutes

2628
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,480
okay let me give you a few more minutes

2629
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,000
let me hit a couple more of the slides

2630
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,719
um

2631
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,400
appreciate the discussion

2632
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,360
uh next slide please

2633
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,199
um so this is i wanted to make this

2634
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:45,360
comment um

2635
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,040
i mean i think i mean at least the way

2636
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,880
i've been thinking about the interaction

2637
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:52,159
between uh the verifier and

2638
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:54,239
the relying party is it's mostly a sort

2639
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,320
of a back-end b2b kind of interaction

2640
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,159
and i think maybe some of you don't have

2641
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,719
have some other ideas about that but

2642
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,040
if it is basically or at least

2643
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,560
in the in the i think the b2b uh um

2644
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,199
use case is a big one it's one that

2645
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:11,440
needs to be addressed um that we need to

2646
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,920
really be cognizant of um so in that

2647
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,760
case i would say

2648
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,760
my understanding is you know json plus

2649
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,040
tls is what everybody does for b2b so

2650
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,119
in terms of that interaction we should

2651
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:26,480
just go with that and let the the the it

2652
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:27,920
guys have been doing that stuff for a

2653
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,920
long time just handle that that kind of

2654
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,600
thing so we don't don't need to worry

2655
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,360
too much about the security of that

2656
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:38,320
um and but i'm not i'm not trying to say

2657
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,960
we have to write a standard for this or

2658
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,239
uh

2659
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:43,679
go into a lot of detail i just want to

2660
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:45,760
be i think you know

2661
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,440
in fact i guess what i'm saying we

2662
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,800
probably shouldn't write a standard for

2663
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,400
too much of this uh next slide

2664
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,679
um

2665
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:54,719
okay

2666
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:55,760
i don't think we're going to have much

2667
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,960
time to get into identity here

2668
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,119
i don't think but i think there's some

2669
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:02,320
some discussion i don't think we have

2670
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,639
enough time to complete this but

2671
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:07,600
i'll say a few things here um

2672
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,480
uh

2673
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,159
i'm starting

2674
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,400
my my uh my understanding of device and

2675
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,320
identity i don't think we have a

2676
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,080
definition of it actually i don't know

2677
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,560
maybe in tcg they have one but i don't

2678
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,400
think i haven't seen one and i'm not

2679
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,840
sure what people mean when they say

2680
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,719
device identity for me device identity

2681
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:27,119
actually had a lot to do with

2682
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,280
telling the relying party the serial

2683
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,760
number the the oem

2684
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,360
the model number and the version i mean

2685
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,280
that's what was in the original eat

2686
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:38,000
draft eight zero zero as adopted by this

2687
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,239
working group that eat draft there was

2688
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:42,159
no verifier in there all the claims went

2689
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:43,679
to the relying party that was the

2690
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:44,800
conception

2691
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,960
and that was adopted by this working

2692
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,320
group in that form before the separation

2693
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,000
was really

2694
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,360
set there so

2695
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,599
um

2696
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,639
seems to me

2697
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:00,560
lots of people want to know serial

2698
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:03,600
number oem model and version of devices

2699
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:04,960
i mean verifiers want to know it and

2700
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,880
relying parties want to know it so it's

2701
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:09,600
like a good place to do some work

2702
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,760
uh

2703
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,199
the term identity is is misleading

2704
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,400
what

2705
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,960
if you replace it by identifier

2706
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,000
then

2707
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,040
you

2708
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,040
see that there are different communities

2709
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,199
or different industries have different

2710
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:30,000
ways to identify

2711
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,840
things they care about the cellular

2712
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,480
industry has other identifiers that they

2713
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:35,920
care about on

2714
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,639
that's on a device that has a sim card

2715
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:41,520
versus someone who has an enterprise

2716
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,679
equipment

2717
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:45,760
and so that's why

2718
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:49,280
it has been impossible so far to come up

2719
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:52,400
with a fixed number or small set of

2720
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,239
identifier types

2721
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:57,280
to have a good way to identify

2722
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,719
these different components that people

2723
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:00,960
care about that's why there's a long

2724
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,320
list of them

2725
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,520
um

2726
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,400
and

2727
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,719
like i can of course provide you a long

2728
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:08,239
list of things that people use to

2729
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:10,080
identify uh

2730
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,760
the aspects like from this from the

2731
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,360
seller world uh

2732
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,119
and and from from other sectors it's

2733
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:18,000
just it's just a long laundry list so um

2734
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,679
better make it extensive

2735
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:21,360
it's it's um

2736
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,840
it's uneventful unfortunately so look at

2737
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,199
the uei

2738
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:27,360
id definition it is an attempt to unify

2739
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:28,800
them it does bring into account the

2740
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,639
cellular industry and it doesn't bring

2741
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:33,040
into account um ieee based

2742
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:34,880
identification and also yeah so we did

2743
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,040
it and it is extended

2744
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,880
some attempts to basically take all the

2745
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:41,199
identifies people are aware of and stump

2746
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:44,159
munch it into some new identifier format

2747
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:47,520
um and so maybe ueid is an attempt at

2748
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,520
that uh if you think there's a problem

2749
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,600
with it then then let's be specific

2750
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:55,320
about what the problem is

2751
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,440
so i'm i'm hijacking hi this is hank um

2752
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,520
this topic so um

2753
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,960
the uh

2754
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,280
to take up the identifier

2755
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,600
in contrast to

2756
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,679
i am absolutely with harness

2757
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:11,760
in the quorum work we provide an

2758
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,760
extensive list of identifiers to

2759
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,119
identify

2760
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,440
the testing environment explaining it to

2761
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:18,880
the verifier

2762
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,400
because it's a reference integrity

2763
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,000
manifest it's like the endorsement and

2764
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,920
stuff and the reference values and you

2765
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,920
have to understand

2766
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,719
what a testing environment is actually

2767
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:30,400
supposed to give you

2768
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,119
evidence evidence about which target

2769
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:34,719
environment that's very important for

2770
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:35,600
the

2771
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,600
appraiser process because if something

2772
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,760
else is doing that it might be the wrong

2773
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:40,800
source so

2774
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,440
as a verifier you have to understand

2775
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,199
which thing in the thing is giving you

2776
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:47,199
the assertions about it so that that's

2777
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:49,040
what column is effectively all about

2778
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,600
that's why the extensible list of

2779
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,560
methods uh how to identify

2780
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,880
a a testing environment and like a

2781
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,239
multiple of them

2782
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:00,000
in an attached i think that actually is

2783
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,400
the identifier thing from so so that's

2784
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,920
that's the first thing i want to say and

2785
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,320
also i want to hijack this time to come

2786
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,560
back to the multiple verifier thing i'm

2787
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,639
very i said i will not touch the

2788
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:12,400
architecture again

2789
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,480
but if we want to say

2790
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,480
there can be multiple verifiers or

2791
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:19,280
multiple entities pro processing the

2792
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,600
evidence from a tester

2793
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,199
that's something i'm willing to put in

2794
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:26,159
that's a very small statement about how

2795
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:28,320
the verifier role works

2796
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,719
i think would address all the problems

2797
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,800
that we just said it could be a few

2798
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,320
sentences and i would be okay with it

2799
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,080
working that out live here on the site

2800
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,719
and then on the list

2801
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:40,880
so it's not a critical need for me

2802
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:43,199
um but the more

2803
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:46,199
yeah

2804
01:48:46,239 --> 01:48:48,000
so just just just to point out on the

2805
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,280
architecture

2806
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,280
we had lots of conversation about the

2807
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,960
difference between

2808
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,520
roles and entities that host those roles

2809
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,400
and it's it and the the idea was that

2810
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,800
roles could be spread across multiple

2811
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,639
entities or

2812
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:04,239
multiple multiple entities could

2813
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:07,199
implement the same role

2814
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,719
sorry to go back there but

2815
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:12,400
i think there should be some discussion

2816
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,719
back and forth between you know on on

2817
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:16,000
identity

2818
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,719
um in particularly i mean

2819
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:21,840
you know if you can't use ueid for your

2820
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,239
your identification use case then let's

2821
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:27,360
talk about why and what's wrong with it

2822
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,760
uh that the specific comments on that i

2823
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,440
would i would really appreciate that

2824
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,239
okay

2825
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,880
so um i looked at the definition uh that

2826
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,679
you defined for ueid and it has three

2827
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:41,760
types of random number uh the ieee eui

2828
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,119
and the imai

2829
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:49,119
and what about uh um we used um uuids

2830
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:51,920
so so

2831
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,639
so hash the uuid and turn it in and make

2832
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:56,800
it random and then it's random

2833
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:59,360
you would stuff it into a random number

2834
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:02,320
that's what it is isn't it

2835
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,480
no not necessarily it's uh like the

2836
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,880
different types of uids uh one is for

2837
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,639
example to create the hash the domain

2838
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:10,320
name and and and so on so there are

2839
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:12,159
different types there's like so

2840
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:13,679
that's the detailed discussion but

2841
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:14,480
please

2842
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,679
probably don't have time for right now

2843
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:18,560
but i think that's yeah so i think i had

2844
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:21,199
one more slide

2845
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:25,760
um oh okay so uh

2846
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:27,599
i'm probably running out of time um so

2847
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:30,560
there is text in uh a pull request that

2848
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,880
i mentioned on the mailing list um i'm

2849
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,199
now calling them uh sort of verified

2850
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:36,960
forwarded claims rather than pass

2851
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,080
through to clarify that

2852
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:41,679
you can take a claim that came from the

2853
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:42,800
attester

2854
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,679
forward it to the uh

2855
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:47,119
the verifier can take the claim that

2856
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:49,679
came from the attester and forward it to

2857
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:52,800
the relying party but that is subject to

2858
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,679
the policy of the verifier and the

2859
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,280
relying party needs to know what that

2860
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,560
policy is

2861
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,960
so it's not just a blind pass-through it

2862
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,599
is subject to the verifier policy that

2863
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:05,040
the relying party should know and i'm

2864
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,800
hoping that resolves that question

2865
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:13,280
next

2866
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:16,100
okay then

2867
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:19,040
[Music]

2868
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:23,519
so this maybe is still um

2869
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:24,400
uh

2870
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:26,320
kind of a question of

2871
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:29,119
what uh what verifier does what and how

2872
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:31,360
you'd think about it but

2873
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,599
um

2874
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:36,080
i mean it's to me there's some some

2875
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,360
verifiers um verifiers are about

2876
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,119
not about are not application specific

2877
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:43,599
they're about the device some verifiers

2878
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:45,679
say the devices are good or bad and very

2879
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:47,280
in a very simple way you know thumbs up

2880
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,960
thumbs down

2881
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,719
um i think in some cases

2882
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,239
there's machine learning risk engines

2883
01:51:56,239 --> 01:51:57,280
and

2884
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,360
they want to combine application

2885
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:00,960
specific things like the transaction

2886
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,480
amount the user account the spending

2887
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,719
history and all that with knowledge

2888
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:06,639
about the device

2889
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:07,599
so

2890
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:09,119
uh you know

2891
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:10,800
they could be very complicated things

2892
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,920
that they don't want to know to know

2893
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,760
that they have the job of verifying all

2894
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,520
the details about the devices so what

2895
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,520
they want is the

2896
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,639
rats verifier to provide them a lot of

2897
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:25,520
validated information about the device

2898
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,440
but not transaction specific information

2899
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:30,400
about the device so i i see the range

2900
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,199
here of in antistation results is from

2901
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:34,560
very simple

2902
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,840
yes no all the way to just

2903
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,520
just check the signature

2904
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,119
know that you're getting validated stuff

2905
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:43,520
and pass or or forward all the stuff you

2906
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,800
you know

2907
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,360
uh on maybe even to add some other stuff

2908
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:50,639
so to me it's a very big uh very large

2909
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:52,239
range

2910
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:54,320
um of what can happen in attestation

2911
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,000
results

2912
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,920
okay i think that was it let me see if

2913
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,760
there's one more nope no

2914
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:00,719
okay

2915
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:02,719
i think we're out of time right

2916
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:05,119
well we're into the open lag time oh at

2917
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:06,960
this point we figured we just had open

2918
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,560
mic okay

2919
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:12,599
so that's it okay

2920
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:15,839
so uh

2921
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:18,800
yeah this is the second you want to

2922
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,199
choose a second session

2923
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:23,040
no

2924
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:26,400
so so maybe

2925
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,080
maybe maybe we could have a little more

2926
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,920
discussion about

2927
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,040
uh

2928
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,800
what happens

2929
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,199
i mean to me the big conceptual thing

2930
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:36,320
here is

2931
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,679
that uh

2932
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:40,880
it's emerging is that a verifier

2933
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,440
when in the rats context its job is to

2934
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:44,960
to do

2935
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,159
things that have to do with device

2936
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:48,320
integrity authenticity

2937
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,159
measurements characteristics about the

2938
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:53,119
device because rats is an attestation is

2939
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:54,800
about the device

2940
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,840
so

2941
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:56,960
a

2942
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:58,880
rat's verifier is about the device it

2943
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,199
doesn't um

2944
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:02,639
the relying party implements their

2945
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,520
policy and that's when they bring into

2946
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:08,560
the um

2947
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,480
the application specific thing like what

2948
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:11,920
you what are you trying to do what's the

2949
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,440
device trying to do

2950
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,360
play content uh

2951
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:16,719
you know give you a measurement that

2952
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,000
you're going to look at

2953
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:22,000
clear a financial transactions so that's

2954
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,080
the relying party policy so that's

2955
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,320
really where i pull apart

2956
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:27,199
um

2957
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:28,880
what's going on on the verifier and

2958
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,719
what's going on the relying party and

2959
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:32,639
therefore that kind of frames up what's

2960
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:34,239
going on in

2961
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:37,440
attestation results

2962
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,678
folks

2963
01:54:40,159 --> 01:54:42,880
i guess so hey gary

2964
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,520
although hold on a sec hank was actually

2965
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:48,480
up before giddy i don't know

2966
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,000
no okay

2967
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,440
giddy you're up on the queue

2968
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:58,560
i can't hear you yet yes can you hear me

2969
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,400
yeah now we can hear you

2970
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,480
yeah on the subject of pass through

2971
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,639
claims i you know i'm speaking selfishly

2972
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:07,360
as a neat editor and i really don't want

2973
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,400
to see

2974
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,880
us getting bogged down in

2975
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:14,080
how a verifier would actually interpret

2976
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,440
a claim

2977
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:19,040
that uh that is presented as evidence uh

2978
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:22,239
before it it can be sent as a

2979
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:24,080
as an attestation

2980
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:26,719
uh in the document i think lawrence's i

2981
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:28,080
actually covered it pretty well on that

2982
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,159
last slide there's just two

2983
01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:33,119
there's a there's a large gamut of what

2984
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:34,639
would be required particularly

2985
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:37,520
multi-stage verifiers for uh

2986
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:38,639
for um

2987
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:41,920
how a verifier would interpret evidence

2988
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,320
against an appraisal policy before

2989
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:47,040
uh relaying it as a pass-through claim

2990
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,639
um

2991
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:50,560
the other thing too is when we when this

2992
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,080
discussion started in the working group

2993
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,239
i looked at the rib document

2994
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:56,560
which i figured was the working group it

2995
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:59,520
was a insufficient working group uh

2996
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,440
um

2997
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,440
met the working group criteria

2998
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:05,199
for a finished standard

2999
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:07,920
um as far as out of station evidence and

3000
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:11,119
conveyance and anastasia results and it

3001
01:56:11,119 --> 01:56:12,960
is specifically not

3002
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:16,159
prescriptive on how evidence is conveyed

3003
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:17,520
as results

3004
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,440
and i think uh you know i'm i'm not

3005
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,040
going to speak for the rib editors but i

3006
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:23,119
believe that that's uh that's actually a

3007
01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:25,760
good thing because uh because i would

3008
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:27,679
imagine even from a tpm

3009
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:30,400
results can be uh results can be

3010
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,159
interpreted and processed in a

3011
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:34,880
multi-stage manner just like uh

3012
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,320
similar to what lawrence has mentioned

3013
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:37,679
in the last slide

3014
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:39,599
so that's my comment i'm not expecting

3015
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:43,840
any response to that

3016
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,920
so this is hank um so what i heard is

3017
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:50,400
are two items here that would be

3018
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,080
basically addressing the

3019
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:55,679
overall thing you can you could argue

3020
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:58,960
that the verifier has a policy

3021
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:01,679
that allows to uh

3022
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:03,599
take evidence values

3023
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:05,760
and their claim semantics and put them

3024
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:08,239
into attestation results but

3025
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:09,920
the relaying party should be very well

3026
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:12,400
aware that this policy exists

3027
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,719
and it was applied and then the second

3028
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:16,239
thing i heard was

3029
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:18,880
it's it's it's actually totally fine

3030
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,800
with the architecture to have

3031
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,679
multiple verifier roles one of them is

3032
01:57:23,679 --> 01:57:26,560
co-residing on the relying party so it

3033
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:29,040
can actually receive evidence without

3034
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,840
any confusion and had a further ado and

3035
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:32,880
do the

3036
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,119
appraisal process of um

3037
01:57:35,119 --> 01:57:37,119
evidence on the underlying parting

3038
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:38,880
entity and then pass it through the

3039
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,920
relying party role that's

3040
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:43,119
co-existing on the relying party i think

3041
01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:44,639
that is more clear

3042
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:47,760
because now with this solution

3043
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,639
um the entity that is the relying party

3044
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:53,280
could also consume reference values and

3045
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,280
endorsements which a relying party

3046
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:56,639
cannot

3047
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:59,679
and so i think the idea that i think

3048
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:01,280
hannes was again going to that we can

3049
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,239
have fire nuances on whether

3050
01:58:03,239 --> 01:58:06,239
multi-verifier things happens uh is the

3051
01:58:06,239 --> 01:58:08,080
better solution because then evidence

3052
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:11,280
can be passed on that's unambiguous

3053
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,599
and and and at the end the relying party

3054
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:16,159
makes sense of it and it's entity that

3055
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:19,199
it is so so i think

3056
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,360
significant smaller leading towards the

3057
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,000
multiple verifier thing except

3058
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,880
instead of the policy that is re-kind of

3059
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:28,880
purposing the values without and then

3060
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,320
you have to understand it and might not

3061
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:31,360
be clear

3062
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,440
but that's just me for now this is a

3063
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,119
discussion so let's let's do this

3064
01:58:35,119 --> 01:58:37,440
discussion okay we've only got two

3065
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:40,320
minutes left so eric and dave i'm gonna

3066
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,239
cut the cue at dave

3067
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:45,040
eric if you can make it quick i'll make

3068
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,000
it quick

3069
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,159
if you look at the architecture document

3070
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:52,080
relying party the term appears 125 times

3071
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:55,280
relying party device zero so relying

3072
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:58,639
party is a role not a physical item

3073
01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:00,639
that's it

3074
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:02,480
yeah okay agree

3075
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:05,440
well it's important

3076
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,000
okay dave

3077
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,719
you're last hey yep dave taylor uh i

3078
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:14,880
just want to say first of all that i

3079
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,880
really liked uh lawrence's uh

3080
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,320
description of a bunch of the topics

3081
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:20,080
there so thank you lawrence

3082
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,480
for example the pass-through slide i

3083
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,560
really like that way of framing stuff so

3084
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:27,360
nicely done i guess my question is is

3085
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,440
the term passed through in any document

3086
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,920
i couldn't find it neither eat or

3087
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:35,199
or ar 4si or anything it's a useful word

3088
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:37,119
to use because i think that's the term

3089
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:38,320
that i'd like to update the teak

3090
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:40,560
protocol spec to be uh or keep

3091
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:41,840
architecture i think it's the protocol

3092
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,440
spec to be able to use that same term

3093
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,199
and reference a document that discusses

3094
01:59:45,199 --> 01:59:47,040
it so that teep doesn't have to but i

3095
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:50,719
think it's jus it's exactly right so

3096
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:53,119
yeah 10 seconds yeah quick comment uh

3097
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:55,199
the the the pr

3098
01:59:55,199 --> 01:59:56,639
to address this

3099
01:59:56,639 --> 01:59:58,400
doesn't use the term pass-through it

3100
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,719
kind of says verified and forwarded and

3101
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:01,840
verified

3102
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:03,440
because pass-through was

3103
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,679
generating some reactions but um

3104
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:08,960
uh there is some text in in a pr that's

3105
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,920
uh

3106
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,960
to talk about this and you can

3107
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:15,520
sort out the terminology on which spec

3108
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:16,719
on eat

3109
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:19,199
okay 400 171

3110
02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:22,159
okay so then uh uh i will check that and

3111
02:00:22,159 --> 02:00:24,639
i will update the uh protocol spec to

3112
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:26,960
use the same words and refer it as soon

3113
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:28,320
as the request is merged so thanks

3114
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,679
laurence

3115
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:32,080
all right with that we managed to be 30

3116
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,719
seconds over

3117
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:37,679
so we are going to convene again is it

3118
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:39,280
tomorrow tomorrow

3119
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:42,480
yeah so we'll convene again tomorrow

3120
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:44,639
thank you everyone and thank you for

3121
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:46,880
those who attended virtually hopefully

3122
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:51,000
we'll see you tomorrow as well

3123
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:00,840
that's brendan

3124
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,040
so on this charter

3125
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:20,280
do i want to move this text yeah

3126
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:29,880
[Music]

3127
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:44,970
that should fight

3128
02:01:44,970 --> 02:01:48,420
[Laughter]

3129
02:01:49,440 --> 02:02:03,760
thank me

3130
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:07,159
so i don't know
