3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,960
i'm mike jones

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,280
one of your two co-chairs for kosai

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,760
thank you all for coming both

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,400
those of you in the room and those of

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,039
you in the virtual room

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,279
i appreciate your participation

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,640
we have a full agenda today we only have

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,399
an hour and

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,120
a completely packed set of presentations

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,120
so

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,239
going through the chair slides

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,719
and i'm starting on time because we are

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,600
so tight

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
um i wonder if the clicker works

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,800
no

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,800
i wonder how i advance slides

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,199
maybe on this computer

20
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,040
uh and the same computer that you've

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,680
started them from there should be like

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,240
arrows near the bottom of the screen and

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
i think that the arrow keys on your

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,040
keyboard will work as well

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,360
and i see brian

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
raising his hand maybe

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
or maybe just playing with the ui

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,960
um

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
i'm not seeing the arrows i would like

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,040
to advance the slide

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,640
the clicker doesn't seem to work

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
ben where did you think i could find

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,759
arrows

34
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,200
uh

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,040
i think they're like

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,880
chevron type arrow

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,759
which

38
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,759
what i'm seeing on the left of my screen

39
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,920
is the participant list

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,640
right

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,920
in the middle

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,799
mute audience

43
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,679
i think you can also if you click on the

44
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,800
slide part and then use your arrow keys

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,879
on the keyboard i forget if it's left

46
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,840
and right or down and up

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,720
i'm pretty sure that works

48
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,359
um

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
the slide i see a slide list

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,840
i'm not seeing the slides on my screen

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,760
sorry about the technical difficulties

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
here i've never used this tool

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,599
has anybody used this tool

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,200
no

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
like if you i can try to

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,879

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,200
be helpful i'm sure there's a ui element

65
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
somewhere to advance the slides i just

66
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,839

which

95
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,919
is the one that looks like a mobile

96
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,280
telephone

97
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,840

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,280
uh

176
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
name the 1952

177
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
rfc to be and uh

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,280
a 1953

179
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,840
subjective rfc2b

180
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,759
know you should get closer to your

181
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,080
microphone and speak louder please

182
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,360
i am sure

183
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,879
uh so basically there and ben caduck has

184
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,120
been spearheading the

185
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,440
discussion with the rfc editor there

186
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,639
has been

187
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,159
a number of exchanges and

188
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,399
most of them are already closed the

189
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,159
important part is

190
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,679
for me a question about

191
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,880
how whether we need to require private

192
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
key

193
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,600
in key operation values this is table 5

194
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,399
in section

195
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,440
7.1 and maybe it will be best first to

196
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
present all the slides and then come

197
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
back to this question if there are any

198
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,120
comments in

199
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,640
um

200
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,519
in

201
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,360
from the participants so this is the

202
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,480
most important question for me that

203
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
we could discuss today

204
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,560
because this is

205
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,519
not exactly consistent with the

206
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,519
rc7517

207
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
and with

208
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,800
nw3c's web crypto

209
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
and we are claiming to be consistent

210
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,920
with those

211
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,600
and

212
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
then there is a

213
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,320
reason formulation of this sentence

214
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
where ben has indicated

215
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,080
uh we might want to check if

216
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,640
this still makes

217
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,399
sense to everyone

218
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,519
whether

219
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
the formulation is still good

220
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,959
um

221
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,720
my personal individual opinion is that

222
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,399
it seems fine but yes if anyone has

223
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,440
other

224
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
opinions

225
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,000
we can discuss that further

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
and

227
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
going forward

228
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,519
so

229
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,680
then there is uh

230
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,519
there were some

231
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,600
comments from carsten

232
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
and

233
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,800
the first one has already been addressed

234
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,399
and there were some texts that didn't

235
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,040
make sense in its

236
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,480
state but yeah now it's fixed and then

237
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,560
there is an update

238
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,000
that

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,440
i was done in

240
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,399
1952

241
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,360
and not in 1953

242
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
documents so

243
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,959
we would need to

244
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,120
make them consistent

245
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
and the last point is suggestions

246
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,920
to

247
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,519
not call cdl a grammar but rather

248
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,480
standard definition language or symbolic

249
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,279
data structure

250
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
makes sense

251
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,040
to me individually but

252
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
we can

253
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,839
discuss if there are other

254
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
opinions and

255
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,880
yes

256
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,399
calling

257
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,120
then to the next

258
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,959
discussion item

259
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,240
carsten

260
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,399
was suggesting to be more

261
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,440
precise when we talk about uh

262
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,160
deterministic

263
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,640
encoding requirements

264
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,920
and specify which section we are

265
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,959
um

266
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,120
aiming for and

267
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,959
yes this is

268
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,199
the text that he has suggested

269
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,040
and

270
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,079
so

271
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,839
that was for the peace

272
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,720
documents and

273
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,839
after

274
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,760
we have resolved those couple of issues

275
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,639
we need to check for consistencies

276
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,720
between the two drafts

277
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,519
and

278
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,399
they should be ready for publication

279
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,959
and then for the hash hawks draft

280
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,320
i answered to some questions from the

281
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,279
editors and

282
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,760
my understanding is that now

283
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,800
ben or some other lady needs to take a

284
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,160
final look and say that it's

285
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,800
good for them as well and then it will

286
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,399
be ready for publication

287
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,040
so next the x509 draft

288
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,320
uh we are going to publish a new version

289
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,079
of the draft

290
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,800
and that was discussed uh

291
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,120
some time ago and

292
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,720
there is an issue

293
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,120
31 that i believe we should

294
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,200
uh get some more uh discussion on

295
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,880
i saw that

296
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,120
today like maybe an hour ago there was

297
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,600
also some and discussion for a new issue

298
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,279
i have not yet uh

299
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,800
dig deep into how it might affect the

300
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,279
draft

301
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,880
so and then

302
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,040
the counter same document as far as i

303
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,480
saw itself with roman and

304
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,959
awaiting kd review

305
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,000
it's in

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,839
a publication requested

307
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,519
status and going then to see burn coded

308
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,959
certificates

309
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,800
um my understanding is that there are

310
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
more reviews that are needed and there

311
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,040
are some small to-do's that are

312
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
still pending there

313
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,800
so that's all the traps and that

314
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
i wanted to present the status of now we

315
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,839
can go back mainly to

316
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,160
see if there is any

317
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,880
quick opinion on

318
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,240
this required private key

319
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,880
fields text or

320
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
maybe we can start mainly please

321
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,079
discussion and device

322
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,279
and in my role as timekeeper this is the

323
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,120
one minute warning honest we'll take

324
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,839
over in a minute

325
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,279
are there any

326
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,680

i will cue hanus's draft and we can

330
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,160
start on that

331
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,760

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,839
comments

um

335
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,920
meeting materials that might be it

336
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,600
does someone know how to

337
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,839

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,279
thank you take us away okay perfect

341
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,560
yeah thanks uh thanks a lot um so

342
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,440
briefly talk about the cozy hpke

343
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,160
document next slide

344
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,880
probably evo needs to do that um

345
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,279
so we had a fruitful discussion at the

346
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,600
virtual intro meeting in january

347
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,639
and i published a zero one version in

348
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,040
response to those discussions and i will

349
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
show the

350
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,759
um the most important change with zero

351
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,040
one i also created as i promised uh

352
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
an implementation a reference

353
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
implementation of this which you can

354
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
find at this link below it's uh the

355
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,360
decocy library

356
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,199
and here's also the link for the draft

357
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,719
repository next slide

358
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,279
so this is uh next slide this is the new

359
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,519
structure um if you haven't been

360
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,000
following the discussions last time so

361
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,880
this is a two-layer structure

362
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,680
at the top um you see the

363
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,839
sort of classical

364
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,560
encryption sort of headers in this case

365
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,399
the ciphertext is not included it's

366
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,079
detached

367
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,759
there's the algorithm information in

368
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,759
there and the topmost the part

369
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,920
and also the nonce uh

370
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,600
and then the recipient structure that's

371
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
where the hb key content goes in there

372
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,639
uh with obviously the ephemeral public

373
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,360
key and then finally with in this case

374
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
with the encrypted keck which is the

375
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,959
keck uh

376
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,799
is used to encrypt the the outermost

377
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,640
plain text

378
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,880
okay so that's uh what's currently in

379
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
the document it's a big change compared

380
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,079
to the previous version next slide

381
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,359
okay

382
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,799
uh open issues so we talked about the

383
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,880
algorithm registry and the the group

384
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,000
wanted to

385
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,799
have an efficient way to reuse

386
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,839
the hbke defined algorithms

387
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
and obviously for the currently

388
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,760
defined algorithms there isn't really a

389
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,080
problem because they are listed in the

390
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,960
now

391
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,760
rfc and we can just uh

392
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
they will be put into the document and

393
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,840
registered but um the question is what

394
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,080
happens going forward

395
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,480
with new algorithms and we had

396
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,400
we discussed primarily the first

397
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,760
approach uh which was to add a rule uh

398
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
in quotes to the hbke uh specification

399
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,320
to then automatically populate uh values

400
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,480
in the cosy registry unfortunately

401
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,320
shortly after the virtual intro meeting

402
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,640
and the discussion the hb key document

403
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,360
was published as an rfc so no changes

404
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,120
were possible anymore

405
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
which leaves us with two other

406
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,559
choices

407
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,400
either to have a rule um with ayanna to

408
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,720
sort of automatically populate

409
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,559
values in the registry which in my

410
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,320
opinion requires some discussions with

411
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,559
ayanna

412
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,000
to make sure that this actually works

413
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,080
some folks in the group were

414
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,559
hopeful that this is simple to do

415
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,480
but i don't know

416
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
and if that doesn't work

417
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,559
and the last approach

418
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,960
is obviously

419
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
this approach is

420
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,160
is uh

421
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,320
is sensible to

422
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
um require that whenever someone defines

423
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,240
a new hpke

424
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,960
uh algorithm or cypher suite then they

425
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,880
need to also populate the registry for

426
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,760
the for the corresponding cozy registry

427
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,080
so that's kind of like nothing really

428
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
earth shaking um but

429
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,280
but at least there was a lot of

430
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,200
discussion on this topic on on the list

431
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,880
i want the questions now or

432
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,559
no no go ahead

433
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,240
i haven't been please go ahead

434
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,360
yeah so i think

435
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
there are definitely some cases where

436
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,600
ayanna will

437
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,480
be able to say when there is a change to

438
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,559
one registry go and reflect that in

439
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,240
another registry

440
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,160
but you're right you should definitely

441
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,200
talk to them about this particular case

442
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,440
because they really want it to be a very

443
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,919
deterministic algorithm that they follow

444
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,280
they don't want to have to use any

445
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
judgment

446
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,200
and i believe they have office hours

447
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
this week but it's probably only in

448
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,480
gather town it may not be in person

449
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
the other option that you can do is to

450
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,880
have the registration policy for the

451
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,480
cozy specific parts involve a designated

452
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,440
expert

453
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,360
and then basically give the experts

454
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,960
leeway to say

455
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,559
whenever there's a new addition to the

456
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,720
other registry they can just

457
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,039
make the new registration

458
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,720
in their role as the experts to approve

459
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,600
it

460
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,840
yeah yeah we'll definitely use the idf

461
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,919
meeting here in some sense it's a pretty

462
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,120
simple task um the cosy or the hp key

463
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,039
registry consists of three separate

464
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,559
registry aadid key fld and camera id as

465
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,000
i wrote on the slide

466
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,320
and in cosi it's just mapped to one

467
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,360
number uh that combines the three uh

468
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,840
well it's it's

469
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,799
uh well

470
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,159
you could call it simple or not i don't

471
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,280
know but uh

472
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,120
but in any case there's some something

473
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
that needs to happen it's almost like a

474
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,159
ci in in case you uh

475
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,520
um

476
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
you make some changes then automatically

477
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,039
does something else

478
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,360
but uh yeah so yeah i don't know if

479
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
someone has some better ideas what to do

480
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,760
but uh it the first option that we

481
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,280
discussed and preferred that the intro

482
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,520
meeting is kind of gone unfortunately

483
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
i think the second one will work pretty

484
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,320
well

485
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,080
uh and i would suggest that we just keep

486
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,240
going in the slide deck

487
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
yeah okay perfect

488
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,400
thanks ben

489
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,039
next slide

490
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
so um that was another point that

491
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
hillary raised that was briefly touched

492
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
on at the virtual intro meeting but

493
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,640
there was no conclusion

494
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,039
or no feedback and hopefully i get some

495
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,400
feedback from you

496
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,720
and russ was kind enough to

497
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,039
reach out to some guys

498
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,120
in the industry to get an understanding

499
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
of where we are in terms of

500
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
state of the art so this is about point

501
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,159
compression

502
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,000
and currently the

503
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,400
the previously shown example with the

504
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
ephemeral public key that was included

505
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,840
in the in the structure in the in the uh

506
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,440
recipient layer

507
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,679
um that's an uncompressed point and

508
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,039
point compression would obviously help

509
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,720
to transmit uh

510
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
fewer bytes on the wire

511
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,520
and it turns out that uh this is a 20

512
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,480
plus year old technology um

513
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,080
and

514
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,720
the idea is to and that was illary was

515
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,960
suggesting to add that capability to the

516
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,720
document as another point format

517
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,840
being optional because

518
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,799
it's not necessarily widely supported

519
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,159
everywhere

520
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,120
for

521
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,559
mostly patent reasons

522
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,200
and so yeah

523
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,360
i think to me that makes uh sense

524
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,200
what hillary was proposing on the list i

525
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,280
don't know if anyone has some opinion

526
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,440
here about this topic or has some

527
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,720
experience with

528
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,799
point compression and this and the like

529
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,280
yes first

530
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,000
please go ahead

531
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,080
um so

532
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,440
my discussion

533
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,440
with some implements where

534
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,480
there was a lot of code

535
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,320
to implement

536
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,159
point compression

537
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,640
and in small devices it would not be

538
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,080
desirable

539
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,120
because you have to add a square root

540
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,760
function that you don't otherwise need

541
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,280
and so the code gets much bigger

542
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,080
so they were opposed to making point

543
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,600
compression required

544
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,480
we'll

545
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
see what other people think but at least

546
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,520
several implementers said that's not

547
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,320
what they want to do

548
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,520
thanks russ

549
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,440
yeah russ checked out um with paper so

550
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,360
at the microphone please say your name

551
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,679
yeah malicious

552
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,640
uh so just the data point for the data

553
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,400
compression i was just working

554
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,440
with the with the point compression

555
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,760
for the past two weeks in the context of

556
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,799
the ad hoc and lake implementation and

557
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,200
it is true that it is poorly supported

558
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,520
in the existing libraries but there is

559
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,039
the rfc 6090 algorithm that doesn't uh

560
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
that doesn't require the implementation

561
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,120
of square root that can be implemented

562
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,520
with the pure module operation

563
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
and that is fairly simple to implement

564
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,000
from my experience so this is and this

565
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
is well needed in the context of

566
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,320
constrained technologies uh in in the

567
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,440
context of bites over the wire savings

568
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
thank you could you guys show peter your

569
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,120
name badge for the purposes of the

570
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,520
minutes

571
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,640
okay 69 one minute warning okay thank

572
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,000
you uh

573
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,240
next slide

574
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,279
um

575
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,120
i will skip that one next slide

576
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,159
in interest of time so this is a change

577
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,240
i'm proposing so

578
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,279
the cosy specification has for all the

579
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,240
different operations it constructs um

580
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
additional data or additional

581
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,880
information to be included in in in the

582
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,320
whole processing

583
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,640
and so regardless of whether you use a

584
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,799
sign operation or in this case an

585
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,320
encrypt operation

586
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,600
and

587
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,919
and that's a that's this information is

588
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,200
also structured as a cosi um

589
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,360
sort of data element

590
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,240
and

591
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,279
currently what's in there in the

592
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,159
document is also an infrastructure to be

593
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,960
used with hbke and initially when it

594
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,039
it's a leftover from the early days of

595
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,400
the document in the suit group

596
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,080
and hbke itself has its own way to pass

597
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,799
information into hp key for inclusion

598
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,200
into the key derivation and so

599
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,400
in my opinion um

600
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,520
that infrastructure is not uh needed in

601
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,000
addition to that so since hb key already

602
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,919
provides uh

603
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,159
uses its own mechanism and provides

604
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,159
addition for someone who wants to pass

605
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
in additional information can do so um

606
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,880
for certain usage environments

607
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,400
but uh

608
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,960
so i'm proposing to remove that

609
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,080
infrastructure from the document

610
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
it's probably something to digest for

611
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
people who are following these type of

612
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,080
mechanisms we are at time i'm going to

613
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,159
have you take that question to the list

614
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,600
yeah i will recognize militia vucinic on

615
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,799
the queue

616
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,760
and then we'll switch presentations

617
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,679
militia do you want us was that from

618
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,880
previous from

619
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,360
the previous thing okay okay

620
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,520
thank you very much janice

621
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,840
and do you engage with on us on the

622
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,480
mailing list

623
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,840
so the next pair of presentations um

624
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,000
i am not the chair

625
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,120
um

626
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,520
evo is the chair i am an individual

627
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,960
contributor

628
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,919
to two documents that my colleague

629
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,640
tobias looker in new zealand is

630
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,279
the primary author of but

631
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,080
it is exactly 12 hours time difference

632
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
and so this was not a convenient time

633
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,760
for him to present

634
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,080
next

635
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,840
so

636
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,400
there's a set of elliptic curves

637
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,480
called bls

638
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,360
that

639
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
belong to the

640
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,679
realm of pairing friendly cryptography

641
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,600
and there's related work

642
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,080
underway at the cfrg there's been some

643
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,799
discussion of this on the mailing list

644
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,760
already from russ housley and the like

645
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,039
and i'd like

646
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,600
russ to comment at the end if possible

647
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,120
so this is used by a number of different

648
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,520
pairing based operations

649
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,960
all this draft does is register jose and

650
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,520
cos a algorithm identifiers so that

651
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,039
these can be

652
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,480
used for cose and jose

653
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,799
it does not define any cryptographic

654
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,240
operations next

655
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,640
so there's numerous applications of

656
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,240
pairing-based cryptography

657
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,559
there's one called bls signatures

658
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,480
there's the bbs

659
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,880
bbs plus signatures work that some of

660
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,080
you who

661
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,159
are aware of some of the current

662
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,480
decentralized

663
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,039
zero knowledge proof work

664
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,279
may have been following

665
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,320
again this is supporting

666
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,080
other work in other standards

667
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,919
organizations but

668
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,080
jose and kosei have become the gold

669
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
standard for

670
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,360
respectively

671
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,919
based and seabore based cryptographic

672
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,360
operations

673
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,679
which is why tobias is

674
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,880
bringing this

675
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,240
draft to this working group

676
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,360
um

677
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
there's also ongoing work on something

678
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,520
called json web proofs that i'm a

679
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,200
co-author of

680
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,640
for

681
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,320
doing jot like in jws like signatures

682
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,440
but with

683
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,600
multi-signature and

684
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,760
zero knowledge selective disclosure

685
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,880
proofs

686
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,200
next

687
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,399
so the only next steps

688
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,279
that

689
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,080
the authors are requesting today is for

690
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,159
people to read the draft

691
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,960
and to comment on the mailing list

692
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,159
um

693
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,760
following a discussion on the mailing

694
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,240
list depending upon how that goes we may

695
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,600
ask for

696
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,679
working group adoption but we are not

697
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,399
doing that today

698
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,360
i

699
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,720
would invite

700
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,480
russ to

701
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,080
speak to

702
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,640
his comments on list

703
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,200
about the charter of this working group

704
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,520
and what we may and may not do

705
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,559
and the relationship between this work

706
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,200
and the cfrg works cited if you are

707
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,320
willing to do that russ

708
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,679
um

709
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,320
i'm not opposed to seeing these code

710
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,639
points

711
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,960
russ you're too quiet for us to hear can

712
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,640
you yell into your microphone please

713
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,279
and the chairs can take that up with

714
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,120
uh the area directors etc and

715
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,399
eva and i will take that action item

716
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,880
uh with me wearing my chair hat and not

717
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,799
as a draft author hat

718
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,840
unless there's questions on this i would

719
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,600
ask you to read and take it to the list

720
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,799
and let's move on to the next

721
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,440
presentation

722
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
this is another one

723
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
that

724
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,559
tobias wrote

725
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,399
in response to a real need seen among

726
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,120
other things that came up during

727
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,799
i believe the development of the new

728
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,559
zealand coveted credentials which do use

729
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,480
cose and sebor web token formats so

730
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,559
here here that we're having

731
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,440
adoption in the healthcare space

732
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,480
uh

733
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,279
next slide

734
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,000
so

735
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,159
we all worked on or many of us worked on

736
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,240
seabor web token together we worked on

737
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,200
cose together

738
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,760
the jot spec which came before

739
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,799
has an interesting feature which dick

740
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,600
hart had requested and some others based

741
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,159
on practical experience

742
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,240
which was dick was looking at if you

743
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,919
have an encrypted token with jwe

744
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,760
you obviously can't see the claims

745
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,159
that's generally a good thing

746
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,399
but sometimes when you're processing a

747
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,799
token like routing it trying to decide

748
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,039
where it goes

749
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,919
you may want some information from the

750
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,480
claims to be publicly visible

751
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,159
and so section 5.3 of the jot spec

752
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,919
explicitly sanctions you repeating

753
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,440
claims that are not privacy sensitive

754
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,399
in the header parameters in particular

755
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,559
the issuer

756
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,399
claim has been repeated in some contexts

757
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,039
in encrypted jots

758
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,000
to help retrieve the key set that you

759
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,360
need to even do the decryption

760
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,919
that's worked out okay for jots it does

761
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,399
not that feature is not present in cwt's

762
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,320
and furthermore you couldn't just port

763
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,240
the feature directly into cwt's because

764
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,039
john

765
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,480
excuse me cwt claim names

766
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,360
and cos a header parameter names are

767
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,519
both small integers with an overlapping

768
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,640
space

769
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,480
so you couldn't just mix and match

770
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,559
next slide

771
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,120
so the proposed solution in this draft

772
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,159
is to define one new

773
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,880
cozy header parameter

774
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,880
the value for which is a set of cwt

775
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,399
claims

776
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,360
that

777
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,559
uh can be disclosed in the integrity

778
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,440
protected but non-encrypted

779
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,720
header

780
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,640
this parallels the chat

781
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,880
functionality that's already been shown

782
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,399
to have

783
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,640
at least been good enough to solve the

784
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
problem at hand

785
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,240
um

786
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,960
i think that should be fairly clear

787
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,679
let's go to the next slide it is exactly

788
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,600
the same as the last slide in the

789
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,840
previous

790
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,360
presentation where we are requesting

791
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
that working group members read the

792
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,480
draft

793
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,240
comment on list

794
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,159
and depending upon how that discussion

795
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,080
goes uh

796
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,200
the authors may ask the chairs

797
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,080
for working group adoption where i will

798
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,640
obviously stay out of that as a conflict

799
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,480
of interest

800
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,279
any comments or can we move on to the

801
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,480
next

802
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,640
presentation because i think we're even

803
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,559
a minute or two ahead

804
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,440
the next presentation is by mike prorock

805
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,800
whose

806
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
remote

807
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,960
um

808
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,520
evo could you queue up mike prorock's

809
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,960
presentation

810
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,839
on post quantum

811
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,639
signatures

812
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,480
and mike are you with us

813
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,239
i am indeed hopefully you can hear me

814
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,599
all right

815
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,280
that's good thank you please please

816
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,480
proceed

817
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
awesome thanks so much all and we can

818
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,480
jump right into the next slide here

819
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,280
i authored an individual draft and then

820
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,599
got some great feedback and support from

821
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,879
a number of folks as well as

822
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,760
contributions so uh and some folks also

823
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,480
obviously working across other aspects

824
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
of cryptography

825
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,960
so we've got

826
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,320
basically the problem statement is this

827
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
we know post quantum algorithms will

828
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,160
come out

829
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,079
from a day job perspective i do a lot

830
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,359
with signatures and i wanted a way to

831
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,880
be able to interoperably

832
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,160
sign things with post quantum uh methods

833
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,599
and make sure that the other side was

834
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,040
interpreting that correctly and that's

835
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,800
with both jose and jose um so we wrote

836
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,119
up the draft initially focused on kind

837
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,720
of two aspects of post quantum

838
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,359
signatures so hash based and lattice

839
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,880
based uh

840
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,040
schemes

841
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,000
um

842
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,480
the main reason for that is

843
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,560
that we want to make sure we have a good

844
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,960
trade-off and good options in case we

845
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,920
find problems uh either with size on

846
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,440
signatures that just make them

847
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,720
impractical or key sizes

848
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,800
or if we find a weakness in one approach

849
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,880
be it a lattice-based approach that has

850
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,560
some fundamental weakness that we're not

851
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,480
aware of we want the ability to fail

852
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,359
over to hash based or otherwise right so

853
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,040
it's really about providing crypto

854
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,720
agility

855
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,280
the main concern i see is that the nist

856
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,359
standardization process is obviously

857
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,480
still ongoing uh for this but but these

858
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,400
algorithms are out they've been around

859
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,560
for a while um they're

860
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,040
you know i guess in what round three and

861
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,680
are you know moving forward there so

862
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,599
i think even if nist does not

863
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,440
standardize one of the algorithms that

864
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,680
we define here we would still want to go

865
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,599
ahead and

866
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,040
um

867
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
go ahead and get it defined uh if for no

868
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,880
other reason than to be able to make

869
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,960
sure that it is defined and we can flag

870
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,800
it as hey please do not actually use

871
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,320
this from like an iona registry

872
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,839
standpoint

873
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,960
uh next slide please

874
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,079
um so you know once again kind of going

875
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,240
back to the main goals we want to really

876
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,400
enable agility to be able to jump up to

877
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
these post-quantum algorithms when

878
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,359
they're appropriate we want to be able

879
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,520
to test ahead of time

880
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
um and then we do want to go ahead and

881
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,040
make sure that we can get in our

882
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,880
registrations done for these post

883
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,920
quantum

884
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,079
signature schemes

885
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,240
otherwise one of the things especially

886
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,599
due to the high level of

887
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,119
parameterization

888
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,480
and the fact that most of these

889
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,880
algorithms get their security properties

890
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,000
from specific combinations of parameters

891
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,599
we want to make sure very explicit

892
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,720
parameters are registered for um

893
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,320
each algorithm so we know what's good

894
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,480
what's bad etcetera right and can put

895
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
that out

896
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,680
next slide please

897
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,200
um the

898
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,119
you know some complexity in getting at

899
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,079
the

900
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,680
um

901
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,599
really kind of getting at the

902
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,079
parameterization side of things right

903
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,560
we really need to be able to use alg or

904
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,040
some other identifier right uh within

905
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,560
there just to make sure that we can

906
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,800
clearly identify what set of parameters

907
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,200
is in use for instance with dilithium or

908
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,960
falcon um

909
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,000
or especially a special sphinx plus etc

910
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,920
so we we do want to make sure that

911
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,240
that's very explicitly stated otherwise

912
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
it'd be very possible to either

913
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,000
misidentify a key

914
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,119
or to uh run a you know run a method or

915
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,720
a signature method with the wrong set of

916
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,640
parameters and that's obviously not good

917
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,598
uh next slide please

918
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,520
so next steps for

919
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,839
us on the individual draft side is to go

920
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,240
through uh really continue flushing out

921
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,640
the algorithm descriptions we've got a

922
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,280
good baseline in place

923
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,920
uh we're looking at as a group uh that

924
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,599
are working on some different ways of

925
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,280
just talking about you know like the

926
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
sign verify operations we're not

927
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,440
defining any new cryptography here like

928
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,040
no desire to do that this is just

929
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,839
pointing back at the well-defined stuff

930
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,760
we may for right now we're just pointing

931
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,440
back to the papers and that they just

932
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,359
stay that way um

933
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,839
we are based on feedback on the list

934
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,400
looking a little broader at some other

935
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,079
hash based signature approaches

936
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,960
especially some more stateful ones

937
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,640
and then we're getting ready to start

938
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,119
into a whole bunch of test factor

939
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,800
generation

940
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,000
and getting into some better

941
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,079
serialization

942
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,119
examples with both jwk and uh with jws

943
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,000
so

944
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,480
uh really the big ask little group is go

945
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,079
ahead and read the draft i know quite a

946
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,680
few of you that i see here have already

947
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,880
done so

948
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,280
um provide feedback and then if

949
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,880
appropriate and if in line for the

950
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,280
charter we'd like to be able to get this

951
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,960
adopted as a working group item and move

952
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,640
it forward uh when the time is right

953
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,320
assuming that it matches the group's

954
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,280
needs

955
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,079
so thanks so much

956
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,560
all right i see

957
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,400
brendan and then jonathan hamill on the

958
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,839
q let me take brendan first

959
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,280
brendan here i just wanted to point out

960
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,079
that there is already a point in cozy

961
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,520
for one of the

962
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,560
uh

963
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,000
hash bay signature schemes hss lms has a

964
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,520
reference in rfc 8778

965
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,359
thank you

966
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,359
jonathan

967
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,720
hello um

968
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,960
yeah i i just want to point out what

969
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,119
what i pointed in chat that the

970
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,480
algorithms

971
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,960
according to the cozy charter have to be

972
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,960
evaluated by cfrd

973
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,520
or um completed public review and

974
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,400
violation by a process that is the nist

975
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,040
process so if these algorithms that

976
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,800
you're defining here are not collected

977
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,359
by nist i believe they would have to go

978
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,319
through pfrg evaluation

979
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,480
i believe that to be true

980
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,200
is there anybody else on the queue

981
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,200
all right if not

982
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,119
i will speak

983
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,880
um

984
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,480
oh there we go

985
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,640
now i can see the cue andrew please

986
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,640
proceed

987
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,560
andrew fragley

988
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,880
you sure i just want to note that the uh

989
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,200
lms and xms

990
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,880
are actually all

991
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,440
approved missed algorithms post quantum

992
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,720
um you read miss 800 sp

993
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,879
208 we'll see their proof there

994
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,400
do you have a document you could

995
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,880
reference in the chat for purposes of

996
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,720
this yeah

997
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,319
that would be fabulous

998
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,400
people don't realize they're approved

999
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,599
because

1000
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,760
they weren't part of the competition but

1001
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
they're acknowledged by this because

1002
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,560
one's up with that

1003
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,119
okay very good

1004
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,800
benjamin

1005
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,480
yeah sorry i guess i

1006
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,760
jumped a little bit too early with

1007
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,480
sending my video but uh i mainly wanted

1008
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,280
to

1009
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,599
just say thank you to my for the um

1010
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,119
yeah to michael

1011
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,520
for the bit about reducing optionality

1012
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,599
and really nailing down the parameters

1013
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,000
for the post quantum stuff and it'd be

1014
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,560
really useful to have these sort of just

1015
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,680
use this and not have people worry about

1016
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,040
exactly what they have to choose

1017
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,119
i agreed with that

1018
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,760
emmanuel

1019
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,640
hey can you hear me

1020
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,760
we can

1021
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,640
okay thanks um yeah thanks a lot a very

1022
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,640
interesting wrap um

1023
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,680
i i think it's it's uh uh

1024
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,720
might

1025
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,359
become like uh in my mind like uh

1026
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,240
two drafts uh in a sense that

1027
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,040
um

1028
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,079
what uh we do with uh jose but with

1029
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,400
causes might be slightly different this

1030
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,599
is like they're

1031
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,319
targeting different uh use cases at

1032
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,119
least in the very constrained case

1033
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,680
uh some of these signatures

1034
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,040
might

1035
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,200
be less appropriate than others

1036
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,280
due to their size and things like that

1037
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,319
um

1038
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,760
maybe uh uh clearly uh separating this

1039
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,280
this use case of very constrained

1040
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,960
devices might uh makes it make sense uh

1041
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,040
there are some things that are really

1042
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,000
uh can be set as less interesting in

1043
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
this in this context of very constrained

1044
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,040
devices

1045
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,160
um

1046
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,960
i i i talk on behalf of the

1047
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,040
committee working on on on the riot

1048
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,880
operating system where we have like very

1049
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,560
constrained devices and microcontrollers

1050
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,400
and things like that i know some of

1051
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,440
people in the room are very uh

1052
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,640
uh sensitive to these types of uh

1053
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,240
constraints um but yeah so so um that

1054
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,960
would be great um actually we we have uh

1055
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,280
um a uh um

1056
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,920
recently previous paper on this uh that

1057
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,400
is analyzing some of uh these signatures

1058
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,760
in this context uh using cozy uh for for

1059
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,319
a suit uh

1060
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,599
secured security for updates on on riot

1061
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,079
devices i can share the link if

1062
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,440
that's interesting also here

1063
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,000
yeah indeed please share links for any

1064
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,160
relevant things for the minutes to the

1065
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,920
chat to help peter out that would be

1066
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,079
great

1067
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,400
um

1068
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,040
mr prorock you have the cue

1069
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,560
gonna note there's a related draft and

1070
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,319
actually can we pop to the next slide i

1071
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,839
think i put a

1072
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,000
uh link reference in there and i'm gonna

1073
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,160
dig up the link and put it in chat

1074
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,319
but this is actually also highly

1075
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,920
referenced and has a number of the folks

1076
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,599
that are also working on the key

1077
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,560
information

1078
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,520
uh

1079
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,720
spec as well i'm linking that now

1080
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,920
um

1081
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,520
the um

1082
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,240
so there's quite a bit of overlap there

1083
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,880
just in terms of yep we already know

1084
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,000
that these things are getting well

1085
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,520
defined the keys are going to be well

1086
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,280
defined and

1087
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,040
now let's make sure we can do this with

1088
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,040
you know compact binary representations

1089
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,200
as well as json representations as

1090
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,200
appropriate

1091
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,960
appreciate it emmanuel

1092
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,520
you have the floor

1093
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,240
oh and it's just leftover i think i said

1094
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,919
what i needed to say sorry

1095
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,440
okay um

1096
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,440
i'll make one closing remark

1097
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,640
um

1098
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,000
which is

1099
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,960
kozai as a working group is chartered

1100
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,040
among other things to do

1101
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,440
registration of algorithm identifiers

1102
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,560
for

1103
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,079
algorithms

1104
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,920
with a certain level of maturity

1105
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,440
we are explicitly not chartered

1106
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,560
to describe new kinds of cryptographic

1107
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,359
operations and there's a fairly bright

1108
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,119
line between the two

1109
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,680
i will say just wearing a hat as an

1110
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,079
individual right now when i read the

1111
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,680
draft

1112
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,160
at first i know that there was a lot of

1113
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,200
explanatory text

1114
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,359
trying to say how these algorithms work

1115
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,520
and how they might be used

1116
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,280
i don't think that was intended to be

1117
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,839
normative but some readers could think

1118
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,200
that it was

1119
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,960
where all the normative components

1120
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,040
should come from

1121
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,839
the authoritative sources

1122
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,440
i'm not

1123
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,760
suggesting a particular action other

1124
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,520
than think about

1125
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,079
making sure that the draft stays on the

1126
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,079
right side of that bright line in our

1127
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,599
charter because otherwise you'll run

1128
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,800
into

1129
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,400
problems with reviewers later

1130
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,200
are there any other comments on this

1131
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,400
otherwise we will switch to the last

1132
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,560
presentation and we are running a few

1133
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,078
minutes ahead of schedule

1134
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,200
all right um thank you mike for writing

1135
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,000
that and thank you for all the feedback

1136
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,599
that's already come on the mailing list

1137
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,319
please keep it up

1138
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,680
hello can you hear me

1139
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,640
we can maybe speak a little louder

1140
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,520
right can you hear me yes that's better

1141
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,880
okay

1142
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,920
so hello everyone i'm joran salander i'm

1143
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,359
going to talk about

1144
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,599
this really short draft who's been

1145
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,240
updated today on uh standing here the

1146
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,240
entire integers next slide please

1147
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,040
so this is something we discussed on

1148
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,800
mailing list

1149
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,240
between

1150
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,240
two previous meetings

1151
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,960
and it's addressing the

1152
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,200
use case when you have

1153
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,920
really tight

1154
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,280
message size

1155
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,520
constraints and you would like to use

1156
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,359
their short in

1157
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,040
key identifiers

1158
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,720
so the cosec

1159
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,680
parameter kid the identifier

1160
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,480
is currently restricted to byte strings

1161
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,040
and c board by strings are

1162
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,920
typically two bytes

1163
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,480
or more except for the

1164
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,760
empty byte string which is a very

1165
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,960
special

1166
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,960
identifier

1167
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,400
and in order to allow more one-byte

1168
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,079
identifiers

1169
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,440
we propose to extend the

1170
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,559
kid value type to int

1171
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,240
seaborg hints which have the order of 50

1172
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,759
and one byte identifiers

1173
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,800
so that's that's the proposal um it's a

1174
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,880
short draft they're essentially updating

1175
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,880
three registries

1176
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,040
and

1177
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,119
that's a little shoppie can you hear me

1178
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,280
now

1179
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,559
thank you

1180
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,160
okay ben had some problems with the

1181
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,200
audio

1182
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,040
so i i think the i mean this is the last

1183
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,720
slide i think the proposal is fairly

1184
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,240
clear on on the

1185
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,400
slide ask questions otherwise it's

1186
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,319
basically extending

1187
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,520
uh the value type for for kid for the

1188
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,839
currencies of kid we had a discussion

1189
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,079
about pros and cons for making this a

1190
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,000
separate

1191
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,359
parameter

1192
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,680
and whether this was really needed

1193
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,680
and i think the conclusion was that this

1194
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,000
was how we should do it

1195
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,119
and i'm happy to have any comments or

1196
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,559
um

1197
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,200
or questions

1198
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,160
okay there's a couple of people who have

1199
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,079
choppy audio here

1200
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,599
i don't know if there's anything that

1201
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,119
needs to be repeat ah

1202
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,040
still possible to understand okay good

1203
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,200
dennis in the queue you're recognized

1204
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,040
yeah so i guess this is my fault for not

1205
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,480
having actually read the draft i do

1206
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,400
agree that

1207
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,280
reusing kid as the parameter instead of

1208
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,240
defining a new parameter is useful

1209
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,160
i just want to make sure that the draft

1210
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,079
talks about like

1211
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,160
the deployment considerations for when

1212
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,880
it is actually safe to use the integer

1213
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,800
form of it

1214
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,880
because if you just have an updated

1215
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,119
sender that starts sending it without

1216
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,880
indication that the recipient will be

1217
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,960
able to do something useful with it you

1218
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,640
will get a lock loss of interoperability

1219
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,640
yeah that's i mean that that type of

1220
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,520
consideration isn't currently in the

1221
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,920
draft but we had the discussion

1222
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,680
at the time and

1223
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,160
the general feeling if i understand if i

1224
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,000
remember right but that

1225
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,800
since this is c boar and if you have

1226
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,319
implemented

1227
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,040
c or byte string you typically have

1228
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,200
implemented zebra in as well

1229
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,359
and these are typed i mean zebra has a

1230
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,599
built-in type typing

1231
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,599
so you would typically

1232
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,440
of course you would notice that there

1233
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,880
there is an error here if you expect the

1234
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,640
byte string

1235
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,720
and you get an in but but you wouldn't

1236
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,359
sort of it wouldn't result in

1237
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,119
any

1238
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,000
uh

1239
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,440
that you would get sort of the wrong

1240
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,760
type of value you would get the wrong

1241
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,720
uh you expect a certain uh string and

1242
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,760
you get some

1243
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,680
get an integer instead

1244
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,558
right i think that's like

1245
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,880
a very clear error it would not be

1246
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,640
mispricing what's there yeah

1247
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,319
it would be basically detecting the

1248
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,079
wrong it's the wrong

1249
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,200
seaboard

1250
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,000
type and that of course if you can't

1251
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,319
support the ins that that would lead to

1252
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,559
a fatal error of course

1253
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,000
right

1254
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,520
okay

1255
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,520
uh yeah i mean i think that having some

1256
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,119
text in the document

1257
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,880
will be good

1258
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
eventually you know by the time we get

1259
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,839
later on into the process

1260
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,240
that's yes

1261
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,400
thank you

1262
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,839
we'll make that update to the next

1263
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,160
version

1264
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,839
other comments

1265
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,040
okay thank you

1266
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,720
i

1267
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,760
i've been waiting to the end uh

1268
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,319
i'll i'm not speaking as a chair

1269
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,720
one thing that i think should be

1270
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,119
explicitly said

1271
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,760
in the document

1272
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,280
is that presently all

1273
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,200
8152 cos a

1274
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,920
implementations would be required

1275
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
to reject a data structure with a

1276
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,960
numeric key id

1277
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,920
there's a there's a data type defined

1278
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,640
for key id it's b string

1279
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,480
and so if you have a conformant

1280
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,640
implementation and you encounter

1281
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,839
something that

1282
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,480
uses a mismatch data type it must be

1283
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,119
rejected

1284
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,240
therefore this is a breaking change

1285
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,520
i am

1286
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,359
certainly willing to leave it up to the

1287
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,200
working group whether to make the

1288
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,200
breaking change

1289
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,599
but it needs to be labeled as such

1290
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,359
because no 8152 implementation

1291
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,040
may be allowed to support it

1292
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,920
right that's that's correct

1293
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,960
but

1294
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,000
okay

1295
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,880
specifically stressed that in the

1296
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,440
in the update

1297
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,800
all right um is there anything else

1298
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,400
you'd like to say karen

1299
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,599
i'm happy thank you

1300
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,920
okay thank you we

1301
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,520
unexpectedly have five minutes of time

1302
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,440
which uh i will now have open mic time

1303
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,960
uh on any koze related topic uh join the

1304
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,359
queue um ben you were in the queue

1305
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,720
yeah i had taken some notes locally

1306
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,119
about the point compression

1307
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,160
presentation but i didn't get to say

1308
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,520
them earlier so i'll go back to that now

1309
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,680
um

1310
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,240
about the

1311
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,200
optionality of it i think that this is

1312
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,720
very likely to be something we would

1313
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,960
want to only be optional i think

1314
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,839
the arguments about making it required

1315
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,839
being potentially problematic carry a

1316
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,520
lot of weight to me

1317
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,079
uh the other topic that comes up is

1318
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,960
about like the relationship of the point

1319
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,240
format

1320
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,400
to the curve

1321
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,559
and so like currently

1322
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,160
we've got the

1323
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,799
uh octet key pair which is used by like

1324
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,119
the

1325
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:49,440
x25509 and whatnot the cfrg curves

1326
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,000
and we've got the ec2 point format which

1327
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,079
is the traditional uncompressed point

1328
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,839
format that's used by like the nist

1329
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,119
curves

1330
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,119
and so if we start trying to bring in

1331
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,040
new point formats that are using

1332
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,880
compressed points

1333
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,960
we would want to think about how we're

1334
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,280
gonna signal that and if it's

1335
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,079
if the intention is to be able to use

1336
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,119
both ec2 and this new compressed point

1337
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,160
format

1338
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,400
on the same existing curves

1339
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,839
we might have some situations where

1340
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,359
it's hard to get interoperability or

1341
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,559
it's very complicated to reason about

1342
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,640
and so we might

1343
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,319
potentially and i haven't thought about

1344
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,760
this very hard but we might potentially

1345
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,960
even like define new curves

1346
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,680
that would use the compressed point

1347
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,119
representation

1348
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,040
as a way of

1349
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,960
having a clear signal that the different

1350
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,280
implementations are able to support it

1351
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,079
and that would potentially reduce the

1352
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,920
risk of drop issues

1353
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,760
uh and

1354
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,440
i guess i will yield to john and get

1355
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,880
back into the queue for my other topic

1356
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,480
i recognize john

1357
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,960
um i i'm very

1358
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,720
can see me but yeah i hope you can hear

1359
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,640
me uh i i think it should be optional i

1360
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,040
don't know exactly what was discussed

1361
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,000
but i think it makes sense as daniel

1362
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,799
bentley has to register a new

1363
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,559
ayanna

1364
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:25,040
code point or compressed format

1365
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,680
it was discussed during the hp ke

1366
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,799
discussions but not really compressed

1367
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,400
point format rather

1368
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,440
compact representation

1369
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,160
i

1370
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,200
don't see any benefit of using

1371
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,079
compressed point over compact

1372
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,240
representation i think the most sense

1373
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,280
would be to register compact resistance

1374
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,720
representation in the http register and

1375
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,598
then use that in code

1376
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,680
thank you ben

1377
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,640
all right i'm back i've been uk and this

1378
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,280
one i'm more as the responsible ad at

1379
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,119
least for a couple more days

1380
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,720
there was a question about whether the

1381
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,520
bls algorithms would be in charter

1382
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,640
and i think given the ongoing cfrg work

1383
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,200
it seems fairly straightforward to say

1384
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,119
it's in charter for us

1385
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,359
obviously if the cfrg work gets

1386
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,040
abandoned or something and it doesn't

1387
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,240
complete we would not want to go forward

1388
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,520
but i think

1389
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,720
it would be reasonable to do

1390
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,598
what we currently have

1391
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,359
okay i appreciate that determination ben

1392
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,640
that helps

1393
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,799
some of the individual authors make

1394
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,200
progress

1395
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:46,799
um

1396
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,880
seeing it that the queue is empty i'm

1397
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,960
going to make a personal statement

1398
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,680
thanking ben for serving as

1399
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,640
a security area director for us and many

1400
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,280
other working groups and it's been

1401
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,280
a pleasure working with you

1402
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,319
and

1403
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,559
if people agree with me maybe

1404
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,559
congratulate him in the chat and thank

1405
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,559
him

1406
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,000
our time together is drawing to a close

1407
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,440
i appreciate the productive session

1408
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,359
going once

1409
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,680
going twice

1410
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,280
we are adjourned

1411
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,599
thank you kosai working group for

1412
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,760
your participation

1413
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,200
i know

1414
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,200
i don't know if i joined it

1415
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,200
i think you can

1416
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,279
but let me see if i can save it

1417
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,000
got it all

1418
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,480
let me know if you can get it otherwise

1419
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,119
we'll send it to you
