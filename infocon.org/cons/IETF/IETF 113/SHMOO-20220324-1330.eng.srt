and um

33
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,119
we also had uh some information about

34
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,680
like uh like you know media like about

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
the the draft like the online meetings

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
draft as well so the adoption call

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,759
completed but we haven't gotten any um

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,680
like you know ea or nay on the draft so

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
we'll probably like continue this like a

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,880
little bit to

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,479
try to at least solicit some reviews

42
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,399
going forward um

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,560
but i think like you know like it's been

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,719
quite well discussed to

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,399
uh see there's like support for adoption

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,159
so i think we'll just continue to get a

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,399
little bit more uh feedback on it and

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,079
media like have you gotten any private

49
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,840

and uh the kilometer online meeting and

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
the adoption call is completed as this

129
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
is the one i talked about earlier so uh

130
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,919
there's like been like no uh comments

131
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,680
received so like we'll just like uh dig

132
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,360
a little bit more to see if somebody can

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
review the draft

134
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
but i think like i would say

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
provisionally this is adopted

136
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,039
going forward and

137
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,280
for like mark's draft is going to get

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,039
presented today so that's also another

139
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,720
draft in the same space

140
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
so like we'll hear my talk and see how

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
we go forward with that

142
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,960
so this is the

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,199
agenda for today it's like fairly light

144
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
so we should be able to finish quite

145
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,400
early so we're not going to cut off the

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,080
mic discussion or any of this stuff like

147
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
unless it goes like really really long

148
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,080
and

149
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
does anybody have any consensus of the

150
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,520
agenda

151
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,039

had uh participating in online meetings

169
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,520
i guess from a slightly unusual time

170
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,160
zone uh in the ietf also when we were on

171
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,479
the iab a lot of this came up

172
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,080
and uh uh also uh in previous lives

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
working on in bodies in places like the

174
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,759
w3c

175
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,759
um and so it's just kind of

176
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,440
basically section two is considerations

177
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,800
for when you schedule online meetings

178
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
things you want to consider

179
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
section three is some recommendations on

180
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
how to find an equitable solution one

181
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,960
that is

182
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
uh uh relatively fair to all the

183
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
participants uh and i think there are a

184
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
lot of uh discussions we could have

185
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,199
about you know the the decisions made

186
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,680
there and and the recommendations these

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,960
are just kind of

188
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,120
my standpoint i'm not particularly

189
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
set in stone but if people feel

190
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
differently i'd love to talk about it

191
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,880
um

192
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,960
and and i've written in in such a way

193
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,759
that that although you know it's an ietf

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,479
document it's not itf specific i think

195
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,759
that a lot of these are things that you

196
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,599
could use in other fora as well if you

197
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,639
wanted to

198
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,639
um and that's intentional

199
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,560
and and and i guess my question today

200
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,319
was i brought this up on gen dispatch

201
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,919
and lars recommended i bring it to

202
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,879
schmoo

203
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,400
i i brought it up in the mailing list i

204
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,599
didn't get any responses so i just

205
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,960
wanted to see if if folks were

206
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,039
interested in talking about this

207
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,800
in this working group

208
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,759
i'm not necessarily asking for adoption

209
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,680
uh just wondering if it's in scope for

210
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,639
for what this group is chartered to do

211
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,680
although if you want to talk about

212
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,120
adoption i'm happy to talk about that

213
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,360
too

214
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,879
i inferred from the text that you were

215
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,960
referring to sort of one-off meetings

216
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,919
rather than big itf meetings is that an

217
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,440
accurate

218
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,240
generally speaking yeah well i mean if

219
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,360
you look at the um if i go back here

220
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,599
um you know effectively we've you know

221
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,360
we've got method one method two method

222
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
three under the 3.3

223
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,599
and the big itf meeting

224
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,679
falls under method three rotate the pain

225
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,519
you know we can't possibly

226
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,839
uh um come up with a

227
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,080
time or or a schedule that you know

228
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,760
meets everyone's requirements and indeed

229
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,279
it's kind of productive to try and do

230
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,200
that because if you know you did

231
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,399
something like say well most people are

232
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,839
from north america so we'll always hold

233
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
them in north america that's not good

234
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
for other reasons and so right it walks

235
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,800
you through those different things and

236
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,480
i'm sure the document can be improved

237
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
but uh generally speaking yeah one-off

238
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,640
meetings it talks about occasional

239
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,240
meetings versus regular meetings and

240
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,839
things like that as well

241
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,600
okay cool i mean this is almost like a

242
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
super set of um

243
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,880
the scheduling bit of miriam i's draft

244
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,640
um we have a hyper specific

245
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
precisely specified version rotate the

246
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
pain

247
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,080
so um i i don't know that these so while

248
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,440
there's some overlap i don't think these

249
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
two are in conflict

250
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,839
okay yeah i i wasn't aware of mary's

251
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,000
draft and i could see incorporating it

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
or or or rationalize them but also i

253
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,519
could keep keeping it separate so it is

254
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,399
useful

255
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,279
in to a broader audience you know

256
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,680
lars is it actually in scope is this an

257
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,240
uncharted or not i can't remember

258
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,399
i think with the newer i think with the

259
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
newer charter it might be in scope right

260
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
like uh lars right like but yeah or like

261
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,480
previously it was not really in scope

262
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,760
off here at all right and um like the

263
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,600
the way i saw it like and last i'll go

264
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,279
like i just want to like i had one

265
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,680
thought on this is that um like mars

266
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,240
draft is like like wider and and and

267
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,519
martin like yours and media has like

268
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,200
goes really into like one section of it

269
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,959
right like in a lot of detail so i i

270
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,399
agree with you like no there's not like

271
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,360
uh

272
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,040
that much overlap like and we had to

273
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,640
figure out like you know how to dispatch

274
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,040
this like so i'll let lars speak next

275
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,600
thanks thanks yes so um

276
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,839
it might be in scope as you say right um

277
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,240
if the group wants to work on this since

278
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
the charter is currently being revised

279
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
right we might stick a change in there

280
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
that makes it very clear that it is in

281
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
scope

282
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
the other option is i mean this is

283
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,160
certainly even if we decide it's

284
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,920
non-scope for the workers certainly the

285
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
forum in which to discuss this and if

286
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,519
there's consensus that it should be

287
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,120
published it could also be ad sponsored

288
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,000
i really don't care frankly um remind me

289
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
is it the bcp level at the moment what

290
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,640
do you intend mark or is it

291
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,120
informational or

292
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,880
i don't know really i i'm sure there's

293
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,839
something on the document but i don't

294
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,120
think i've really got that far with it

295
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
yeah so i i i'm open for suggestions

296
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
right i mean if if the working group

297
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
wants to take this on it seems like a

298
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,200
very small change to make this more

299
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
explicit in the current charter text and

300
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,560
we can certainly do that

301
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
um in terms of the overlap between the

302
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
the two documents right one way to do

303
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
this if marx really has more options and

304
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,399
is a bit broader and maybe more general

305
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,480
you could take that part out of your

306
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
documents and refers to his and vice

307
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,120
versa

308
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
well i mean i think uh

309
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
i mean we are addressing the specific

310
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,959
issue of scheduling big its remotely and

311
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
so this is like an instantiation of this

312
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,480
that is super duper specific okay so so

313
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
the right approach then would probably

314
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,880
to

315
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,959
point to mark's document to say this has

316
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,640
some general considerations and for the

317
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,279
purposes of the itf right we are

318
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,519
instantiating them in the following way

319
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,640
yeah right

320
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,160
so um as people the isg know i have

321
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
massively overthought a lot of these

322
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,560
issues um so i would be

323
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,079
i would certainly be interested in

324
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,639
reviewing this um whether it like is in

325
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,240
this forum or another one i don't really

326
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,720
care but uh you know i know what others

327
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,399
think thanks

328
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,079
yeah thanks uh thanks uh martin right

329
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,600
like pete just walked in like so this

330
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,320
was like a referral from uh gender spat

331
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,839
so like you know if pete wants to join

332
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,519
the line later that'll be good us all if

333
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,839
he has his uh thoughts on it

334
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,920
and uh robert you're next

335
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
yeah sorry go ahead um sorry can i

336
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
respond to martin there real quick yeah

337
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,079
sure i don't think it necessarily needs

338
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,000
to refer to um

339
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,680
the more specific itf big meeting

340
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
document needs to refer to this it would

341
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,639
be a

342
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,480
strange if they were not aligned on on

343
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,000
how they you know speak about that

344
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,519
particular situation

345
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,399
but

346
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,079
maybe a footnote at the very most i

347
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,279
don't think it needs to you know you

348
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,560
don't need to read both documents

349
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,800
necessarily um

350
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,959
but i i do think i would like it if

351
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,639
we're if if it's going to go forward i'd

352
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,079
prefer for it to be in a working group

353
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,920
because i really want to try and use it

354
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,440
to establish some principles that we can

355
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,519
agree to rather than just you know and i

356
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,800
think it's better to do that in a

357
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,279
working group

358
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,279
thanks mark yeah in that case i would

359
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,880
suggest that we have a discussion about

360
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
whether this should be adopted and and

361
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
um depending on what the consensus if

362
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
it's positive we figure out what words

363
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,440
need to change in the charter if any

364
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,920
okay thanks

365
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,800
so mark you mentioned that the

366
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,040
document is

367
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,240
likely

368
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
to be applicable outside just our

369
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,720
community and while gathering um

370
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
requirements for how

371
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
we can apply the

372
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,480
algorithms that you're trying to build

373
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,000
to our community

374
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,639
have you approached um

375
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,160
big scheduling organizations the

376
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,600
timeanddate.com doodle anybody like that

377
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,440
to see if they were working on similar

378
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,399
problems and could provide

379
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,279
input into um

380
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,959
into the discussion it might be useful

381
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,480
for us

382
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,000
or to see if they would want to adopt

383
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,320
this into their tooling

384
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
i i think that'd be interesting i

385
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
certainly haven't talked to them and

386
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,000
the the document does refer to some

387
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,360
existing tooling

388
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,839
um

389
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,560
but uh

390
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,399
i don't know that they've

391
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,480
this isn't really about tooling per se

392
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
it's it's more about

393
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,000
coming to equitable

394
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
uh scheduling for all the participants

395
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,399
um there's certainly some some

396
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,000
interesting paths to explore there but i

397
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,760
haven't yet talked to anyone

398
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,440
i was thinking more in the terms of i

399
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
guess accidental reuse or or unintended

400
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,160
unintended reuse

401
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,079
in that you know

402
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,519
the the discussions we had about

403
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,760
scheduling iab meetings for example were

404
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
almost exactly the discussions we had

405
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
about scheduling uh w3c technical

406
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,800
architecture group meetings

407
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,600
um because it's it's a similar problem

408
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,040
and so that's why i've written in the

409
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,439
way that i have

410
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,959
but yeah i think that's going to be

411
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,920
interesting to kind of have those

412
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,399
discussions

413
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,600
maria you're up next yeah hi here's my

414
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,519
coolerment um yeah thanks for writing

415
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,880
this down i think the thoughts on the

416
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,360
document are a really good read um i'm

417
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,279
i'm and like i think this is the right

418
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,639
venue to have more discussion of that um

419
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,519
i'm not sure if we need this as an rfc

420
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,240
um and then the other bit i was like i

421
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,680
was when i

422
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,760
first saw your draft i was actually

423
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,279
expecting something a little bit

424
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,519
different because i think you also

425
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,959
been very much involved in the

426
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,040
discussion about like how many interview

427
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
meetings do we need what should be

428
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,800
discussed in the plenary meeting or

429
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
what's more appropriate for an interim

430
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
meeting design teams like which people

431
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,320
should be there and you have like also

432
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
different priorities about like who you

433
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,440
want to schedule around depending on

434
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
what you discuss in the meeting so i was

435
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,519
hoping a little bit more for this kind

436
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,759
of advice because that's also more itf

437
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,279
specific and i think would be very

438
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,800
valuable to have that discussion as well

439
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,959
i agree it would be valuable to have

440
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,399
that discussion i haven't attempted to

441
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,800
do that in this draft i really

442
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
for now i'm just interested in figuring

443
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,279
out

444
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,680
the scheduling issue um but yeah there's

445
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,959
lots more to dig into i'm sure

446
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,519
thanks mark

447
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,560
sean you're up next

448
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,639
one two three just making sure my audio

449
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,399
is coming through um i just want to say

450
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,320
that um i welcome this draft the number

451
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,040
of times that i could uh use this to

452
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,880
inform other people in the world that

453
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
there are time zones that are not their

454
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,680
own and that there's ways to pick things

455
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,240
which are not always in your best best

456
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,880
interest but will get the work forward i

457
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,040
think is the way to go and i welcome

458
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,680
this draft thank you

459
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,519
thanks sean thanks

460
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,720
uh mallory you're up next

461
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,959
yeah i put myself in the queue also to

462
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,040
um say that i think this draft is really

463
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,199
important and i'm really glad that mark

464
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,120
you wrote it as somebody who has to

465
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
endure i think a lot of pain

466
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
based on your time zone so it's good

467
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,800
that it's coming from you um i just also

468
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,839
wondered if um there's any interest in

469
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,399
making this explicitly about synchronous

470
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,320
meetings and making that more explicit

471
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,399
synchronous online meetings or

472
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,639
maybe there's also um

473
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,720
room to talk about the asynchronous

474
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
meeting idea which

475
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,240
is present in a much longer draft that

476
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,520
has other things that are out of scope

477
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,599
such as like how to set an agenda and so

478
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,760
on for um asynchronous meetings in a in

479
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,520
a draft that's long since expired but

480
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,319
that i presented at one point to schmu

481
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,799
that might be also an alternative or it

482
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,039
could be a small section of your draft

483
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,439
where um it's just not possible to

484
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,280
create a synchronous experience for

485
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,960
people that

486
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,799
is is manageable um just as an idea

487
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,480
thanks

488
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,320
that's a great idea and i think i

489
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,480
definitely could add a discussion of

490
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,840
do you really need a sickness meeting

491
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,840
effectively

492
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,880
thanks mark

493
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,520
valerie where you done

494
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,000
thank you uh daniel

495
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,799
so

496
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,679
yeah

497
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,720
i think it's um

498
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,480
the draft is useful to provide some

499
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,640
recommendation and to

500
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,679
at least explain why we pick um

501
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,280
one hour instead of the others

502
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,520
the other thing is um i haven't read the

503
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,039
draft but um

504
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,400
i think

505
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,559
it should be a good place to

506
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,320
um

507
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,720
to figure out what are the motivations

508
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,440
and provide some guidelines on

509
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,640
does a

510
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,480
an interim meeting is needed

511
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,360
um to select the date also and how we

512
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
can organize that

513
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
interim meeting for example

514
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
at some point we can also have a

515
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,440
compromise we don't have necessarily

516
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,039
everyone at every interim meetings or

517
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,160
some sometimes we can privilege um

518
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,039
one time zone over the others um this is

519
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,240
also one reason we have two chairs um

520
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,320
some kind of things uh

521
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,720
that might be helpful to set um

522
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,160
the time zone

523
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,919
and um those interim meetings

524
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,480
yeah i think uh um

525
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,559
danielle rotate the pain part of the

526
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,480
draft like does cover that right like

527
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,120
mark uh like what daniel have done

528
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,760
yeah thanks

529
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,840
okay

530
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
thanks mark that's i see the queues

531
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,080
exhausted unless there's somebody in the

532
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,679
room who wants to talk

533
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,520
uh pete like i i

534
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
saw you walk in like did you have any

535
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,720
thoughts about

536
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
uh whether like you know you want to

537
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,080
have this engenders patch or not mark

538
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,320
expresses interest that this

539
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
uh stay in a working group and lars said

540
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
like he's open to it so did you have any

541
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,400
thoughts about it or like uh if you just

542
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,240
can just give me a thumbs up or don

543
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
that's fine too

544
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,480
this is pete bresnik it absolutely

545
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,320
doesn't make a difference to me

546
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,080
you know gen dispatch

547
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,720
can't work on documents so the only

548
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,039
thing we would do for mark is talk about

549
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,760
and decide where he should take it and

550
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,960
it seemed like if shmu is going to be

551
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
one of the possible outputs you folks

552
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,360
might as well talk about it first if you

553
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
can't come to a conclusion then bring it

554
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,880
back to us that's fine

555
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,159
perfect thank you thanks

556
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,400
okay so it sounds like next steps maybe

557
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,640
i should talk to the chairs yeah please

558
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,480
thank you and we'll have a chat with

559
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,159
lars as well like just to make sure like

560
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,000
you know i'll look at the

561
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
chatter with mallory to make sure that

562
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,360
it's covered if not like i will send

563
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,080
some gifts to lars did rush did you want

564
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
to do a humd or a tool poll or whatever

565
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
it's called

566
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,799
so we have some data whether people

567
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,400
think that

568
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
i mean it sure sounds like it but we

569
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
only heard from like five people

570
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,280
okay sounds good

571
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,440
okay let me write like some question

572
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
that kind of makes sense right

573
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
this is your chance to use the new

574
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
process

575
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,679
we used to make up these polls by just

576
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,679
talking and fumbling right and now at

577
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,200
least you can type and correct and

578
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,960
nobody sees it which is an excellent

579
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,960
improvement

580
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,720
okay so i did start up all right

581
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,700
okay so um

582
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,919
[Music]

583
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,360
still hand slowly going up

584
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,440
okay so i i see uh i would say unanimous

585
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,520
interest to work on this so

586
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,679
we'll kick off a process to see if we

587
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
can

588
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
start another option call soon after

589
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,918
talking to lars

590
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,158
thanks

591
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,360
okay

592
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,080
thank you very much mark

593
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,399
daniel you're up next

594
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,559
let me give you slide control you have

595
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,520
slight control daniel

596
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,640
okay

597
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,640
okay

598
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,600
hi everyone so

599
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
i'm going to talk um about

600
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,039
co2 emissions

601
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,360
that are associated to

602
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,080
the itf meetings

603
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,360
so the question is um sort of very

604
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,520
simple is um

605
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,559
i i started that work asking myself can

606
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,360
the iclf continue with a business as

607
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,000
usual where we have three

608
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,360
um

609
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,000
in-person meetings a year um

610
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,840
because on on the one hand each of those

611
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,679
meeting uh with um in-person meeting

612
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,600
involves thousands or more than a

613
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
thousand international flights

614
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,159
and on the other hand we have science

615
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,799
that is urging us to reduce the co2

616
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,080
emissions

617
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,039
um

618
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,799
recently so

619
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,200
um the the working group ii of the ipcc

620
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,520
six uh assessment report has been

621
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,559
published

622
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,840
um it's quite alarming um un secretary

623
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,600
general called it a code red for

624
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,799
humanity

625
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,679
um the guardian described it as

626
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,559
the starkest warning yet of major

627
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,559
inevitable and irreversible climate

628
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,919
changes

629
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,240
so

630
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,919
the question is uh what should we do

631
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,679
what can we do

632
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,000
should we do something

633
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
so the question i started with are

634
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,559
what really happens if we're

635
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,400
considering the recommendation for the

636
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,240
ipcc

637
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,000
how it's going to impact the way we

638
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
operate the itf

639
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,120
um

640
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,440
and then um i was also wondering what is

641
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,440
the exact amount of co2 um or i mean an

642
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,240
estimation of the co2

643
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,120
that

644
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,000
either the itf meeting represents or um

645
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,600
that um is associated to one itfa

646
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,360
uh going to one meeting two meetings

647
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,000
three meetings and so on

648
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
and um

649
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,679
so um

650
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,600
so having meeting with air flight so air

651
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,240
flight was the main concern and um we

652
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,520
can also see that yeah what um

653
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,600
what is that being envisioned for

654
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,520
aviation to be to remain more

655
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,679
sustainable and

656
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,559
if we take that trends those strands and

657
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,240
those

658
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,200
and if we apply those to the earth light

659
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,919
are involved in the idea of medics um

660
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,159
what would be the outcome so that's a

661
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,039
third

662
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,480
thing i tried

663
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,919
um but

664
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,880
what we need to also consider is that

665
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,080
yes co2 or flight co2 emissions is one

666
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,400
aspect of sustainability and

667
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,799
there is a more general question is how

668
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,000
can we drive how can we lead the itf as

669
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,960
a 21st organization considering

670
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
sustainability um

671
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,600
and um switch from the 20th century to

672
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,679
the 21st one

673
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,400
and this is a much broader question i i

674
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,520
am i'm

675
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,919
i'm not trying to respond to that one

676
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,559
but um i mean my main focus would be

677
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,880
that we need probably to have some

678
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,000
expertise and to some help to define a

679
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,200
plan for that

680
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,960
larger question

681
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,279
so the material is um i'm using is a

682
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,760
available on on this website

683
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,520
um

684
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,600
and i've already had a presentation um

685
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,400
on the aid workshop i see someone in the

686
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,799
queue yeah that's what i was gonna ask

687
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,640
uh danielle so richard like do you have

688
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,039
a clarifying question on this i just

689
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,840
wanted to an observation basically so

690
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
while we are discussing here the co2

691
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,320
impact of an in-person meeting

692
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,559
specifically i would want to make the

693
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,360
observation that the overall co2

694
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,720
emissions

695
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,279
energy equivalent overall of the

696
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,200
internet so basically the technology

697
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,840
that we are doing here in the ietf has a

698
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
much larger impact and if we are really

699
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
serious about this i don't think that we

700
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,120
should um focus so much on the

701
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,000
on the on the sense so to speak rather

702
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,399
than on the dollars meaning looking into

703
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
energy efficient technologies or

704
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,520
improving energy efficiency overall in

705
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,480
our protocols and reducing

706
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
energy consumption there because that

707
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
quite frankly would have

708
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,640
orders of magnitude larger impact than

709
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,279
discussing um if 1 000

710
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,760
uh people flights should be saved or not

711
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,120
thanks

712
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,880
yeah thanks uh richard like there has

713
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,320
been some work richard like you know

714
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,520
that like at least we did in the

715
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,840
interior for like you know use of um you

716
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,360
know like multicast and things like that

717
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,520
to conserve energy but and they have

718
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
been like a few point solutions uh i

719
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,960
remember there was like either a working

720
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,360
group or a bar for a research group like

721
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,799
back in the day for like energy

722
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,440
efficiency and so on um i i think i'll

723
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,600
try to find the links and ship it off uh

724
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,520
richard like and yeah your point makes

725
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,760
sense right but it's right now has not

726
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
been like a coordinated effort

727
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
on that last go ahead

728
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,919
yes as a follow-up um this was a

729
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,600
proposal for a research group called

730
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,320
eerg for energy efficient research group

731
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,200
and that was roughly 2009 i think so if

732
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,799
you google for irtf eerg you find stuff

733
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,240
from those meetings i recently had a

734
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,520
look because

735
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
other people seem to be interested in

736
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,919
revisiting that again and maybe doing

737
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,520
some research there and so i think colin

738
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
has it also on his radar as something

739
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,720
that might

740
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,600
happen in the irtf um but it could also

741
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
happen in the ietf i guess it depends on

742
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,000
what people want to do

743
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,440
sounds good and thanks a lot that's what

744
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,960
i remember so i remember it was a long

745
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,399
time ago so i didn't remember it was

746
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,760
2009 but yeah thanks

747
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,640
so i mean if i had to respond to richard

748
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,679
i would say um i'm very much happy that

749
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,480
he shares some information he has

750
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,360
um

751
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,080
the reason i was focusing on on only the

752
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,399
travel is that um

753
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,640
we have uh also

754
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,679
um

755
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,720
less impact on

756
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,039
how the technology is being used

757
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,760
um than that we do have on travel and

758
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,559
it's also that everything i've found is

759
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,559
uh more that

760
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,919
the the emissions are mostly related to

761
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,240
building the device as opposed to using

762
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,919
those

763
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,039
and so so that was the

764
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,880
reason i focus on something we can

765
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,600
actually do something on but i'm very

766
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,559
much happy um um if uh pretty sure you

767
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,120
can share anything on the on the mailing

768
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,360
list

769
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,000
not not to that you get me wrong i'm not

770
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,279
saying that this is

771
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,640
an effort that you shouldn't be doing

772
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,480
i'm just saying uh there's a larger fish

773
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,000
to fry as well

774
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,120
as

775
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,200
also the small fish and quite frankly

776
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,960
i'm really happy that you bring it up

777
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,320
because this is something that each

778
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,080
every individual here that is

779
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,240
participating can do something about

780
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,399
most most airliners they

781
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,320
offer you the chance to basically offset

782
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
your co2 emissions when you buy the

783
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,679
ticket by

784
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,600
yeah mitigation efforts whatever they

785
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,760
are offering so there are some ways that

786
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,840
we can do it on an individual basis

787
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,200
already

788
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,679
but if it's a in the more broad scope of

789
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,240
the itf or

790
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,080
the scope of the

791
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,240
meeting obviously that's good as well

792
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,000
thanks

793
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,240
thanks richard

794
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,720
thank you

795
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,159
okay so i'm going ahead

796
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,799
so um

797
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,519
what does the science says um so

798
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,640
um

799
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,279
everything mostly what i took as a base

800
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,840
is the ipcc which is the an

801
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,600
internationally accepted authority on

802
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,000
climate change and this work is widely

803
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,919
agreed upon by leading climate

804
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,240
scientists as well as a government

805
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,799
and the reports are usually taken as an

806
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,519
input for the unfccc

807
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,640
so

808
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,360
some of the numbers are that we

809
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,799
the limit is clearly being set to uh 1.5

810
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,399
degree of warming

811
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,120
um they even insisted that if we reach

812
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,440
two we will have um

813
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,399
um

814
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,080
a dramatic impact on the ecosystem

815
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,760
um human health and so on and if we want

816
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,080
to reach that 1.5 degree celsius

817
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,320
of global warming emissions should be

818
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,039
cut by roughly 50 by 2030 and we need to

819
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,799
reach the zebra net

820
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,320
the net zero by 2050

821
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,120
so

822
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,000
i am going very fast in the

823
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,320
i provided um

824
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,679
some

825
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,080
very basic history

826
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,679
to show that

827
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,519
science is not something has not

828
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,200
contradicted itself

829
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,080
at one point they're always keeping that

830
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,480
same method over and over for uh more

831
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,159
than 30 years

832
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,360
and um

833
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,440
currently i mean everything has been

834
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,679
confirmed everything they say 30 years

835
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,640
before has been confirmed today

836
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,000
and uh currently one the target remains

837
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,440
to be 1.5 if we don't do anything we're

838
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,320
moving to um estimation are showing that

839
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,240
we're heading to 3.6 degree warming so

840
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,279
um

841
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,880
i mean we are

842
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,240
we are not ahead on schedule

843
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,600
so um

844
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,799
the other thing is about aviation

845
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,279
aviation so it's a major contributor to

846
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,799
global warming

847
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,120
um

848
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,918
it contributes

849
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,320
around four percent

850
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,360
and um

851
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,039
even though even though they're

852
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,120
responsible for 2.5 percent of the

853
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,519
emissions co2 emissions i mean their

854
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,840
contribution is four percent

855
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,480
um because mostly they're using non-co2

856
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,760
also

857
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,799
um and aviation is projected to cause

858
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,480
about um 1.0.1

859
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,200
um degree of warming by 2050.

860
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,559
so here is where um aviation this is the

861
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,799
increase of aviation

862
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,640
and you can see that you have a big

863
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,360
decrease there due to the kobe 19.

864
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,679
the gray box shows where we should be to

865
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,679
address the 1.5

866
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,440
and um i mean you can see in the bluish

867
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,399
color

868
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,519
that um we're um

869
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,480
we will soon be over uh the target um

870
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,799
you can see in green where we shoot what

871
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,240
is the path we should take um

872
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,679
toward

873
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,760
the goals for 50

874
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,000
2050.

875
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,918
what we need to understand with aviation

876
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,280
is that

877
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,079
or even co2 emissions is that

878
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,320
what matters is also the accumulations

879
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
of the co2 so

880
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
we can't do much about what has been

881
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,760
already emitted

882
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,399
but we can't do about um

883
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,960
i mean reducing what we will be emitting

884
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,800
um that one thing

885
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,119
so

886
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,760
so the three approach i'm gonna going to

887
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,000
detail this approach one we follow just

888
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,320
the ipcc recommendation and see how it's

889
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,359
impact our meeting if we meet as we've

890
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,639
used to meet

891
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,320
before the pandemic

892
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
approach 2 is

893
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,639
estimation of co2 emitted

894
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,160
by the itf meetings approach 3 is how we

895
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,359
apply

896
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,520
different scenario to

897
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,359
aviation to our traveling

898
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,480
approach one it basically says cutting

899
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,800
the emission by 50 so if we have three

900
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,359
meetings you cut by half

901
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,079
it makes um you have a one in person

902
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:16,960
meeting

903
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,400
a year and two virtual meetings a year

904
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,079
again it's

905
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,839
if we operate the same way we used to

906
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,000
operate which is uh three meetings a

907
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,200
year

908
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,839
net zero is everything is a virtual

909
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,040
so approach 2 is estimation of co2

910
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,640
so we developed

911
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,880
a tool

912
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,839
what it does is it it actually takes a

913
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,359
real flight

914
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,160
um with a different uh legs

915
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,040
and um for each legs applies

916
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,960
different models to estimate the co2

917
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,240
emissions

918
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,960
so the models we use is uh we use uh the

919
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,400
one referred in my climate um we used uh

920
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,839
another one on go climate we go climate

921
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,280
uh provide us access to the api

922
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,359
and so we use that one

923
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,400
um

924
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,200
so

925
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,119
for each attendee

926
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,480
we got the country we take um the most

927
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,440
representative city of that country

928
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,400
or at least the closest city to

929
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,640
where we can actually get a flight

930
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,560
um it's um

931
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,359
it's not always easy when a lot of flies

932
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,599
have been cancelled so we do our best to

933
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,079
do that but it works pretty well

934
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,440
and then

935
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,520
from that flight itinerary we compute

936
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,400
for each leg the co2 applying the

937
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,760
the models that have been defined

938
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,040
so here is what we

939
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,400
um

940
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,040
what we end up with so for each meetings

941
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,800
from its 72

942
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,839
we compute the co2 emitted

943
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,119
in blue for for the in-person meetings

944
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,960
um in orange we provide the co2

945
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,160
that um a remote participant would admit

946
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,119
if he

947
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,359
if he had attended to that meeting so

948
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,000
it's a it's like a virtual emission

949
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,839
um

950
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,320
and so well this is what we we can

951
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,880
figure out on this

952
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,760
so um

953
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,760
i mean

954
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,920
the interesting thing also and this is

955
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,960
why we represent the the co2 emission

956
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,040
associated to um

957
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,240
remote um participants is that

958
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,880
it's it can be used um also as another

959
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,680
metrics that combine the distance and

960
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,280
the participation um as opposed to uh if

961
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,200
you just uh count

962
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,800
a participant as plus one so it means if

963
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,480
you have a meeting for example um

964
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,440
in let's say in paris uh it makes a

965
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,280
difference if the person is coming from

966
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,520
belgium then he's coming from new

967
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,280
zealand so um considering those co2 is a

968
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,320
is a metric that uh could be interesting

969
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,920
yes me here

970
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,800
go ahead

971
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,359
hey um so is that normalized by number

972
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,280
of participants or is also where we see

973
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,800
like the higher peaks is because we had

974
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,119
more participants

975
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,839
so that's um for each for each

976
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,280
participant i compute the co2

977
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,680
and then i'm doing a sum so if you have

978
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,839
many many

979
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,440
participants um

980
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
i mean

981
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,119
i mean given the distance if you have

982
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,960
many persons i mean if you have an itf

983
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,800
in paris and you have many participants

984
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,240
in braxton's

985
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,400
uh yeah i mean uh having many

986
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,640
participants will have a small impact

987
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,079
but um

988
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,240
i do consider the number of participants

989
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,520
as well

990
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,200
so it's not normalized media if i

991
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,800
understood correctly

992
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,720
it's the yeah number of higher number of

993
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,919
participants will give a larger number

994
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,720
go ahead martin

995
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,920
thanks i don't mess with the thing um

996
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,240
am i am i reading this correctly that

997
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
the remote meetings have the same carbon

998
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,000
impact as as the regular ones

999
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,240
i i think uh daniel was explaining that

1000
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,760
like you know the it has assets that

1001
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,119
remote people if they had been there

1002
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,200
this would be the impact

1003
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,598
ah okay

1004
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
which is actually a good thing because

1005
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,720
we means um

1006
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,079
i mean we roughly have the same

1007
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,640
participation that's uh how you can read

1008
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,799
it

1009
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,640
so

1010
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,720
in term of uh quantity of emissions um

1011
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,599
i found out that i i do um an average uh

1012
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,640
only considering the in-person meetings

1013
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,359
um and i took that we have

1014
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,200
3.2

1015
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,000
gigagram of co2

1016
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,240
per itf meeting

1017
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,319
and um if you're an

1018
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,800
itfa

1019
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,920
i mean uh

1020
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,160
participating in

1021
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,480
that's the average value

1022
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,920
is a 2.5 ton of co2 per attendee

1023
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,720
so that's only an average so the big

1024
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,280
question is now um okay that's big

1025
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,040
numbers

1026
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,599
but uh what actually oh that's numbers

1027
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,720
but what do they actually represent

1028
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,959
um

1029
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,960
so the way i to i i consider um

1030
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,079
the it i mean to to have an um to be

1031
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,640
able to compare the numbers we have

1032
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,960
and to see if that's big numbers or

1033
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,440
small numbers i took the

1034
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,400
co2 emissions per capita

1035
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,960
from different countries

1036
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,760
and i try to figure out where um itf

1037
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,280
meetings would be

1038
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,560
so

1039
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,119
what we can see is that

1040
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,640
participating to one itf meeting two itf

1041
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,599
and three meetings bring us very close

1042
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,359
to um

1043
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,000
what is actually needed by um

1044
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and

1045
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,240
i mean

1046
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,400
the only participation to the itf

1047
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,000
meetings is very close to what um

1048
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,839
habitant needs

1049
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,720
um to to to live for a year in some

1050
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,000
countries

1051
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,920
and if we do get a little bit more into

1052
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,760
the countries we can clearly see that

1053
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,960
if you attend three itf meetings

1054
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,440
the number i found

1055
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,480
you

1056
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,520
you almost emit as much co2 as some

1057
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,640
people

1058
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,760
living in germany or poland are um

1059
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,040
emitting

1060
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,720
and we have to take into account that

1061
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,280
germany and poland are um economies that

1062
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,560
are heavily based on coal which is um a

1063
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,480
heavy hemature for example i think

1064
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,520
germany is using 50 of its energy is

1065
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,960
using coal and pollen it's 90 percent

1066
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,640
um if you attend two itf meetings

1067
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,440
um

1068
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,680
you're using um

1069
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,920
you're emitting as much as co2 as

1070
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,079
someone living in uh greece italy or uk

1071
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,800
and um if you have one itf meeting it's

1072
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,119
uh like someone living in mauritius or

1073
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,119
venezuela

1074
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,480
well i mean it it works what it was it's

1075
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,599
just to give um an idea of uh

1076
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,800
what um

1077
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,960
co2 it represents um

1078
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,319
we also have to account that we i mean

1079
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,560
um as i mentioned before i use two

1080
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,760
models go climate and my climate um we

1081
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,040
do have a 20

1082
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,520
somehow uh difference between the two

1083
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,560
um

1084
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,040
and uh if we comparing to the results j

1085
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,119
is providing we also have a 20

1086
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,720
so um i mean the the countries could be

1087
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,960
shift and it's um

1088
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,400
there are some uh merging for

1089
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,480
discussions as well but it gives a good

1090
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,079
average and overall we can see that um

1091
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,800
the question is really um

1092
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,680
do we

1093
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,880
do we have any way to justify that uh

1094
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,240
we're emitting as much as a big polluter

1095
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,240
on only for to participate to itef

1096
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,640
meetings

1097
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,720
yeah daniel i think like a like few

1098
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,880
people were confused on the per capita

1099
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,960
thing on the chat so uh if uh can i try

1100
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,200
to explain my understanding and see uh

1101
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,760
if i'm right like just to clarify

1102
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,800
yeah

1103
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,560
okay so what you're saying is if you go

1104
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,319
to uh one itf meeting you are emitting

1105
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,160
um as much co2 as like a person

1106
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,920
over a year in like countries like

1107
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,240
mauritius and venezuela is that the yeah

1108
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
you think about okay so like so you're

1109
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,480
talking about annual co2 emissions like

1110
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,640
based on countries and and the countries

1111
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,480
are like on the labels on the x-axis

1112
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,760
right like sun you're looking at the

1113
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,920
intersect points and seeing uh how much

1114
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,280
like each meeting

1115
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,160
attendance cost like the the planner

1116
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,920
would that be a good summary

1117
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,680
okay yeah that's it

1118
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,920
okay thank you

1119
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,359
um

1120
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,400
uh

1121
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,560
george did that make sense to you or i

1122
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,240
don't know if i should say jorge or

1123
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,920
george like if that made sense to you

1124
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,599
just like type in the chat

1125
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,040
thank you thanks

1126
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,119
and yeah you can come to the mic like if

1127
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:29,920
uh

1128
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,760
if you have questions like we do have a

1129
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
bit of time today so like you know feel

1130

if somebody comes up we can talk okay

1135
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,440

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,839
yeah feel free to interrupt and go to

1137
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,599
the mic um

1138
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,920
i can i'm not good at multi-processing

1139
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,680
so i i want uh

1140
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,839
i'm not closely looking at the chat

1141
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,078
jim

1142
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,000
for that uh before the the graph that

1143
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,400
you just showed that confused me the

1144
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,280
most um

1145
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,359
it almost looked like it was

1146
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,200
recommendation that we should have our

1147
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,760
meetings in ulaan batara or something

1148
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,440
like that or

1149
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,560
uh

1150
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,040
conversely in um

1151
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,200
congo

1152
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,880
i i

1153
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,839
it just just confused me i

1154
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,760
so so this is basically just sort of

1155
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,960
comparing

1156
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,880
comparing emissions uh as opposed to

1157
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,960
recommendations for where we should be

1158
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,599
citing our meetings i mean uh your

1159
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,440
earlier graph i thought was pretty

1160
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,119
interesting because

1161
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,599
you know we could see that the emissions

1162
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,440
had a lot to do with where the meetings

1163
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
were cited

1164
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,599
um and then and then it was followed by

1165
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,880
this which kind of confused me

1166
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,240
no so i am i'm providing no indication

1167
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,359
on where we should um

1168
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,200
uh set the meetings it's just to compare

1169
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,400
those

1170
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,800
but um it's just to be to to realize

1171
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,839
that

1172
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,040
um

1173
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,240
if we're going to three meetings the co2

1174
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,319
that we are emitting by simply going to

1175
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,880
the three itf meetings

1176
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,319
correspond to the co2 emitting emitted

1177
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:43,440
by someone living in poland or germany

1178
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,440
and if you go to two meetings um

1179
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,960
you go to uh it's equivalent to the co2

1180
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,760
emitted by someone living in countries

1181
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,680
where economy is less based on coal

1182
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,760
so with less emissions

1183
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,560
and uh i think i mentioned uk

1184
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,079
italy

1185
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,319
probably france and so so those country

1186
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,800
now if you go to one meeting um the

1187
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,319
countries um the co2 the data we have i

1188
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,599
mean it's uh

1189
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,640
we have to

1190
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,200
to also take a pinch of salt in that but

1191
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,000
um it's a venezuela mauritius um it's uh

1192
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,240
what does it mean well we need to to

1193
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,640
think about it but um

1194
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,440
it's um it still means that

1195
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,359
it's quite a lot

1196
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,880
um if the co2 that we are requiring just

1197
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,400
to attend the meeting

1198
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,920
uh the co2 emissions that uh someone

1199
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,440
living in those uh

1200
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,280
heavy emitting

1201
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,119
countries uh it's just an equal sign

1202
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,800
got it thank you

1203
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,400
thank you uh ted you're up next

1204
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,280
excuse me

1205
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,680
all right thanks ted lemon um so a

1206
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,920
couple things here one is uh you say

1207
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,520
that the recommendation is to go to one

1208
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,079
meeting a year but in fact cutting us

1209
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,079
cutting our meetings in half would

1210
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,160
probably mean that we'd be going to

1211
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,680
three meetings every two years since

1212
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,119
currently we have three meetings every

1213
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,720
one year that half would be three every

1214
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,280
two so one and a half meetings a year

1215
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,480
um

1216
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,440
and uh yeah i have to i have to agree

1217
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,599
with the previous uh

1218
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,319
i guess jim fenton that these graphs are

1219
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,240
not particularly illustrative it's sort

1220
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,920
of like telling us how many football

1221
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,599
fields

1222
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,640
um which isn't very helpful you have our

1223
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,480
bathtubs yeah so um and also like like

1224
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,880
you know in your you you talked about

1225
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,160
gigagrams versus tons again it'd

1226
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,680
probably be good to put both numbers in

1227
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,720
the same

1228
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,760
um

1229
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,240
same unit yeah so uh

1230
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,839
but the the main thing that i wanted to

1231
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,520
to bring up here is that um

1232
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,760
i

1233
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,559
i feel like this is sort of um

1234
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,640
fiddling while rome burns

1235
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,520
um and so it does this doesn't feel like

1236
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,359
it's all that useful because i mean

1237
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,800
what's probably going to happen if we

1238
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,880
actually went ahead and did anything

1239
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,520
to reduce our co2 consumption would be

1240
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
that we'd feel really good about it and

1241
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,000
we'd feel satisfied and then we wouldn't

1242
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,200
actually do anything that made a

1243
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,319
difference because this isn't going to

1244
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,599
actually make a difference sorry um

1245
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,319
and so uh what is not going to make any

1246
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,680
difference

1247
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,960
so the the the amount of co2 that we're

1248
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,520
burning as compared to the amount of co2

1249
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,400
um that the total world is burning is

1250
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,000
such a small number

1251
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,760
that um the amount of effort that we put

1252
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,160
into saving that co2

1253
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,920
uh could probably be more effectively

1254
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,400
put elsewhere like we would probably be

1255
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,559
able to reduce

1256
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,119
co2 emissions by a lot more

1257
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,960
by spending that effort somewhere else

1258
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,040
that's all i'm getting at

1259
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,760
um

1260
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,119
i mean no i'm not even talking about in

1261
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,359
the itf i mean like this is just

1262
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,920
this sort of thing like you know

1263
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,920
one one thing to say is that is that

1264
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,240
it's not clear to me that co2 offsets

1265
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,760
are actually useful

1266
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,599
like there's been some indication that

1267
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,520
some of them are scams

1268
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,440
um so

1269
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,800
i think

1270
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
just like i think it's worth stepping

1271
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,559
back and actually looking at the problem

1272
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,839
systemically

1273
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,839
rather than saying oh yeah we accept the

1274
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,000
frame that the problem is we're using

1275
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,079
too much co2 and so we need to do

1276
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,400
something to stop using so much co2

1277
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
personally that's not going to solve the

1278
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,240
problem it's a systemic problem

1279
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,000
so i think it's not helpful to really

1280
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,240
talk about this as if that's a real

1281
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,839
a real approach because it's not

1282
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,920
thanks ted

1283
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,240
uh last year up next

1284
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,599
yeah i had a question and i don't know

1285
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,040
if it's a question for daniel though now

1286
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,440
for uh for ted so so um the

1287
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,800
recommendation you have on the last

1288
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,960
slide basically it's very clear the one

1289
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,559
bullet that says you know one meeting

1290
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,000
per year

1291
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,400
um and and i guess that implies that you

1292
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,240
looked at carbon offset schemes and have

1293
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,000
decided that they are not an option for

1294
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,839
us and and if so i would like to know

1295
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:06,839
why

1296
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,559
or

1297
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,520
so um

1298
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,400
so so we're moving to the last slide so

1299
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,640
um

1300
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,880
so what i'm i'm saying is that um if we

1301
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,880
if we assume that we have to reduce i

1302
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,760
mean the recommendation for ipcc is that

1303
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,400
we reduced by 50 percent

1304
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,760
right but

1305
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,400
so i i'm just taking that and saying

1306
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,640
yeah how does it impact and actually i'm

1307
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,640
just looking um

1308
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,200
at what what the emission of the itf

1309
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,119
represent because if we found out that

1310
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,440
it was one milligram then we could say

1311
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,400
yeah it doesn't work

1312
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,119
but but so there's one one way of

1313
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,559
reducing the emissions would basically

1314
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,359
to cut the travel that the organization

1315
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,880
causes in half which is what you're

1316
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,520
proposing here or cut it into a third

1317
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,720
right

1318
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,319
and another way to look at this is we

1319
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,319
could offset the costs

1320
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,240
there's probably okay

1321
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,040
some of them might not be uh you know

1322
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,800
might be fraud but but others might not

1323
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,160
be and so i'm wondering if you have

1324
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,800
looked into this and and decided

1325
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,559
that that is not viable and and if you

1326
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,240
have looked into us and decided some

1327
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,079
bible first i would like to know why and

1328
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,200
if you haven't i think that would be

1329
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,040
good to say

1330
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,800
okay so this goes in my uh

1331
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,720
third point

1332
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,839
which is

1333
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,839
basically we need to have a strategy on

1334
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,440
that um

1335
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,839
we and and because offset is very

1336
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,119
complex

1337
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,200
so i haven't looked at that because i'm

1338
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,000
not an expert in that and and and this

1339
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,480
is a why we need some

1340
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,520
expertise from outside to do the right

1341
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,520
thing so that's um

1342
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,599
i am not considering it because i have

1343
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,280
no opinion on

1344
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,079
on how to use offset it can be good or

1345
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,720
bad but i i don't have the expertise to

1346
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,480
say uh what to do

1347
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,960
and um this is why my strong

1348
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,599
recommendation is that um

1349
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,720
we do

1350
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,920
uh involve some uh external expertise on

1351
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,920
to tell us what to do thank you that

1352
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,640
clarifies it and so so i think what you

1353
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,119
want to do is you want to show data that

1354
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,960
tries to

1355
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,520
uh illustrate our carbon footprint but

1356
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,839
but i would then maybe not

1357
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,400
put recommendations on the slide at all

1358
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,559
like because if you if you say that you

1359
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,000
can't look at all viable options because

1360
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,359
you're not an expert and maybe the

1361
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,079
recommendation of cutting out travel

1362
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,079
is is maybe not

1363
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,520
um since it's not everything that's

1364
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,839
possible um maybe that's not sort of

1365
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,520
that should be presented as the only

1366
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,160
outcome that that you see for us

1367
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,520
you know what i'm saying oh no no it's

1368
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,160
not the only outcome it's uh um

1369
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,200
it's a if we have to reduce

1370
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,240
um this is one uh one way um

1371
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,800
okay i mean at least my my purpose is

1372
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,400
more to to raise

1373
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,319
and to say there is a problem we need to

1374
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,640
solve

1375
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,000
yeah thank you

1376
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,920
uh richard you're up next

1377
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,599
so again uh just to reiterate

1378
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,000
the point with the per capita co2

1379
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,160
emissions is a little bit very

1380
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,119
quite misleading uh part of that is in

1381
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,800
the western lifestyle basically what we

1382
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,880
are doing here in the itf so what we all

1383
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,800
are doing uh the zuwa missions are co

1384
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,720
rco2 footprint is including effectively

1385
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,240
um

1386
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,559
the co2 emissions that we cause by

1387
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,319
participating in uh

1388
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,800
in travel like this right so

1389
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,680
if

1390
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,200
so i'm just saying this is not it's not

1391
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,680
a strict scientific investigation if you

1392
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,440
compare it like that's in it's becomes

1393
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,839
misleading the other thing is i don't

1394
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,040
think that a

1395
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,680
recommendation like having only one

1396
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,400
meeting per year is quite frankly the

1397
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,880
one that we need to do um if that would

1398
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,319
be like um

1399
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,280
your

1400
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,440
the suggestion is that you in person

1401
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,119
participate only

1402
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,920
in that one meeting per year that is um

1403
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,880
on your continent say so that it reduces

1404
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,079
your

1405
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,079
the the length of travel the co2

1406
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,920
emissions of that travel that's

1407
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,440
obviously something that we can that we

1408
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,559
have personally choice over uh while i

1409
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,040
don't think that we need to carb the

1410
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,960
number of itf meetings overall

1411
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,040
but i think it may be a good idea to

1412
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,839
have something like a recommendation um

1413
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:26,640
this

1414
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,640
next meeting will

1415
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,119
be calls based on your locality and

1416
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,960
based on the locality of the

1417
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,880
of the conference that amount of co2

1418
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,000
emissions

1419
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,440
do you really want to

1420
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,520
impact the global uh climate with that

1421
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,880
number of c2

1422
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,319
rather than saying

1423
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,720
ietf can only have one meeting per year

1424
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,000
thank you thanks richard um martin

1425
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,640
you're up next

1426
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:57,359
yeah let me try to synthesize a few

1427
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,839
things um thanks for the the analysis of

1428
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,440
the carbon footprint i think that is

1429
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,119
interesting information and maybe helps

1430
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,799
people who look at it people who are

1431
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,319
exposed to it will be able to think

1432
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,880
about what they're doing um in a more

1433
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,240
knowledgeable way

1434
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,040
um i would like to share the push back

1435
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,400
against

1436
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,240
making a recommendation in this space

1437
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,160
not only because you have not you're not

1438
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,520
able

1439
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,200
to evaluate all the alternatives but

1440
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,400
also because

1441
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,000
uh you know you're missing half the cost

1442
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,599
benefit equation

1443
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,280
um ietf meetings in person have benefits

1444
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,960
including benefits for the client for

1445
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,200
the climate um

1446
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,359
uh because

1447
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,760
for example webrtc has had benefits for

1448
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,880
the climate

1449
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,119
um

1450
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,079
and lastly uh to kind of echo some of

1451
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,810
what ted was saying um

1452
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,440
[Music]

1453
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,319
uh

1454
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,119
i think itf acting alone will have no

1455
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,960
practical impact

1456
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,760
um

1457
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,280
if there's a collective effort by

1458
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,280
organizations to reduce their carbon

1459
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,960
footprint of meetings

1460
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,240
that would be a more interesting

1461
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,000
proposition to me

1462
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,920
thanks

1463
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,559
thanks martin yeah so that's easy to say

1464
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,480
we can't do anything because the other

1465
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,960
are not doing at first it's wrong

1466
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,960
um icann is also looking at those

1467
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,160
numbers

1468
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,200
um so i disagree with the fact saying uh

1469
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,520
oh if the other are not doing we're not

1470
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,319
doing um which i i think it's the sense

1471
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,119
of

1472
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,559
the comment

1473
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,400
of

1474
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,760
your comment as well as ted comments um

1475
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,920
for sure we we need a default from

1476
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,480
everyone and that's what it makes it

1477
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,240
hard to handle

1478
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,640
but um

1479
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
and we need also maybe

1480
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,920
uh to to maybe clarify what are the

1481
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,400
huge benefits of uh yeah we do have some

1482
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,680
um

1483
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,359
there are some benefits of in-person

1484
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,400
meetings

1485
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,799
but uh diesel has to be balanced with uh

1486
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,280
the cost also

1487
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,960
thank you and and daniel there's like

1488
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,000
two things that came up right like

1489
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,280
whether we should do something or not

1490
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,040
and and like largest point what we

1491
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,079
should do right like so there's

1492
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,240
different ways yeah exactly so yeah if

1493
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,160
you can note both of them thank you

1494
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,480
uh george jorge like thank you i don't

1495
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,160
know how to say it so sorry if i got it

1496
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,200
wrong

1497
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,680
it's okay you know you can say it

1498
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,839
wherever he works for you

1499
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:22,799
you know

1500
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,599
thank you so much enough for the detail

1501
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:26,559
you know

1502
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,200
amount of information and analysis and

1503
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,359
that is you know really what is getting

1504
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,359
me lost you know i'm getting lost in the

1505
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,799
numbers because

1506
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,720
when you do comparisons between

1507
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,400
countries you know there are so many

1508
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,200
variables you know including gdp

1509
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,880
that have to do

1510
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,839
whether it's convenient or not to have a

1511
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,119
meeting

1512
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,160
i agree with lars that this looks like

1513
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,440
something

1514
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,920
we should consider

1515
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,040
and probably you know your presentation

1516
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,440
is a good motivation to think

1517
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,760
do we have to find

1518
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,520
an external consultant experts you know

1519
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,079
that can say okay what is the actual

1520
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,520
impact of

1521
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,920
every meeting not just on the co2

1522
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,280
emissions but

1523
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,520
economic impact you know benefit you

1524
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,920
know what you guys we are talking about

1525
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,640
i think that you know a good proposal

1526
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,760
would be

1527
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,319
you know to say okay this is something

1528
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:25,119
that

1529
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,640
we as

1530
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,240
eternal geeks

1531
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,119
should

1532
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,400
investigate and get you know experts to

1533
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,559
work on this problem and give us a

1534
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,000
recommendation thank you

1535
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,480
oliver

1536
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,720
please go ahead

1537
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,440
so i think that's my third bullet which

1538
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,839
is

1539
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:02,160
a taking tackle the problem with some

1540
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,040
expert in that

1541
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,280
okay

1542
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,400
oliver

1543
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,640
going once

1544
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,879
do i

1545
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,880
i'm already go ahead

1546
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,960
thanks um yeah i um it occurs to me that

1547
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,880
this is also being said in the chat to

1548
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,880
join which is great but that

1549
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,760
we simply raise awareness and

1550
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,960
help

1551
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,240
people individually or companies

1552
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,079
calculate these costs then they can make

1553
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,599
their own decision

1554
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,920
because for example like if we

1555
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,920
just generally ask folks to participate

1556
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,440
remotely more just sort of being

1557
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,720
suggested making it easier to do so um

1558
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,280
you would think then that

1559
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,160
the far away distant meetings are the

1560
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,480
ones you would want to avoid

1561
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,920
because the emissions would be greater

1562
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,960
but in in my personal view it's the time

1563
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,359
zone that i then need to trade off so

1564
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,000
because i you know have a family because

1565
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,599
i have you know the the nature of my

1566
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:07,680
situation means that it's the meetings

1567
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,760
that are far away that i would i would

1568
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,520
most want to travel to it's the ones

1569
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,240
maybe middle distance that i could um

1570
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,599
you know do without um so so that is

1571
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,359
always going to be a factor people are

1572
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,440
going to be weighing um those things you

1573
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,000
might also imagine that some companies

1574
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,960
have

1575
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,319
um individuals in different regions and

1576
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,319
so they can make decisions and

1577
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,880
trade-offs based on who's more proximal

1578
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,280
who can cover um

1579
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,079
you know ietf sessions in person versus

1580
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,240
a way so we can't really imagine how

1581
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,440
folks are going to make the decisions

1582
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,119
but we can help

1583
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,799
by raising awareness and giving them the

1584
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,559
tools to make their own calculations and

1585
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,400
so i think that kind of guidance could

1586
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,960
actually be very useful um but whether

1587
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,359
or not to actually just host entire

1588
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,119
remote meetings um

1589
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,240
as part of the decision making that

1590
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,240
comes out of that i'm i'm like others a

1591
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,160
little bit um more dubious of that

1592
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,880
although um having been a part of many

1593
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,440
couches before shmu existed um

1594
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,599
you know before the pandemic like you

1595
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,599
know i was i was a member just because i

1596
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,480
had experience doing remote um meetings

1597
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,440
around the world in a previous job and

1598
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,760
it was stated like some folks actually

1599
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,880
thought you know if we could get the

1600
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,119
ietf to reduce its number of in-person

1601
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,039
meetings by one per year that would be

1602
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,359
an amazing goal but you know i don't i

1603
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:28,799
don't know we would obviously need more

1604
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:32,160
than just um emissions to drive um that

1605
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,520
movement

1606
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,119
thanks

1607
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,520
thank you um oliver like if you want to

1608
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,000
skip back ahead go ahead

1609
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,680
yeah can you hear me now

1610
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,880
yeah thank you

1611
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,200
wonderful yeah um first of all i want to

1612
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,880
say thank you for the for the work you

1613
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,119
put in and the effort

1614
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,160
um

1615
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,240
i have two questions or one question and

1616
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,720
one comment actually did i understood

1617
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,079
correctly that you that you identified

1618
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,960
that remote meeting

1619
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,319
has the same carbon footprint like

1620
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:05,839
uh

1621
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:10,079
like like an in-person meeting today no

1622
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,599
no so

1623
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:12,400
um

1624
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,640
because i'm only considering a flight

1625
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,280
um if you're attending remote you're not

1626
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,480
flying you you i provide the number is

1627
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,039
zero kilogram of co2

1628
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:25,920
okay

1629
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,119
um so it's just if you were flying ah

1630
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,599
okay good so the the the

1631
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,280
one part

1632
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,799
what maybe i have a little bit of

1633
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,720
problem with is

1634
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,359
you said that you don't make any

1635
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,520
recommendation where to meet

1636
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,480
um

1637
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,039
i think when we make these studies

1638
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,680
they should then maybe help to identify

1639
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,319
where would where would we use the least

1640
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:52,000
or where would he have the least carbon

1641
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,359
footprint

1642
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:54,400
um

1643
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,480
by always looking back on iit have to

1644
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,559
see okay from where did the participants

1645
01:03:58,559 --> 01:03:59,760
come from

1646
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,280
um

1647
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,000
i don't think it's a good idea to skip

1648
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,280
meetings um

1649
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:09,599
okay

1650
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,039
maybe in person meetings

1651
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,520
one per year so that that might be

1652
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,039
looked at

1653
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,520
i think ted made i think it was ted and

1654
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,599
correct me if it wasn't

1655
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,440
who made a good

1656
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,280
comment in regards to the economical

1657
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,839
impact i mean when we go somewhere we

1658
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:30,640
ought to contribute to the local economy

1659
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,119
so not ever we shouldn't only look into

1660
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,079
one side and the cost what we incur but

1661
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,440
also in the benefit what it brings

1662
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,200
so i think i think there's much more

1663
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,559
behind the scene what what in the first

1664
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,599
look was not really incorporated what i

1665
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,599
believe should also be incorporated as

1666
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:50,400
well

1667
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,440
um and that also comes with

1668
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,880
so if i see if i look for example in the

1669
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,640
carbon footprint here at my house since

1670
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,240
i'm remote working

1671
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,200
um

1672
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,440
of course it goes much higher up because

1673
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,799
now we are

1674
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,839
longer in the house we have to heat the

1675
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,039
house we have more

1676
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,359
equipment running and so forth and i

1677
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:14,000
think that also has to be

1678
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,599
looked into

1679
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,440
if we don't travel the airplane still

1680
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,119
flies

1681
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,559
so these are the things where really one

1682
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,280
has to to to look very careful into the

1683
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,880
data to see

1684
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,559
isn't there in

1685
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,480
a fault of that what we have in there

1686
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,400
that that is not correct

1687
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,599
and but again i i

1688
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,200
welcome you for the good work and

1689
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,640
i think it's worthwhile looking further

1690
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,240
into that

1691
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,640
thank you thanks oliver um ted you're up

1692
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,879
next

1693
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,680
all right ted lemon um just one thing

1694
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,200
before i actually say what i want to say

1695
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,680
is i tend to have a cognitive bias

1696
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,760
towards criticizing and i apologize if

1697
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,359
my my previous comment was basically

1698
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,280
just 100 criticism i do appreciate you

1699
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,400
doing this work

1700
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,520
um

1701
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,200
the uh

1702
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,559
you made a couple points there that i

1703
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,319
think makes sense um

1704
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,160
one is can the ietf actually do

1705
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,920
something to reduce the number of uh

1706
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,839
in-person meetings that people do all

1707
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,839
you know all around

1708
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,240
the existence proof of the itf has done

1709
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,440
that because if you look at what

1710
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,440
happened during during the pandemic you

1711
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,280
know most of our meetings were on zoom

1712
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,799
or media meet echo or whatever

1713
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,280
that's something that you know we all as

1714
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,960
a society collectively learned how to do

1715
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,240
that was possible because of what the

1716
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,960
ietf had done and also because of what

1717
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,640
organizations like zoom had done to

1718
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,599
produce that software so there are there

1719
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,520
are winds like that that we could

1720
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,960
probably enable

1721
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,799
that would far outweigh

1722
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:45,039
any kind of carbon uh reduction that we

1723
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,039
get from not coming to meetings i say

1724
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,319
that as someone who really think you

1725
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,000
know like i was one of the people that

1726
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,119
was having that conversation with

1727
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:52,400
mallory about well can we just have

1728
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,680
fewer meetings because of all this

1729
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,720
carbon

1730
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,720
but you know having having missed six

1731
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,280
in-person meetings at this point i think

1732
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,400
um

1733
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,480
and then coming to one man it is really

1734
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,079
useful to come to these meetings we get

1735
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,359
a lot of stuff done it's hard to really

1736
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,160
quantify the value of that and so

1737
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,960
i i just don't feel like

1738
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,960
i don't feel like we know enough to to

1739
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,400
to make a clear

1740
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,920
statement that oh if we had fewer

1741
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,440
in-person meetings that would actually

1742
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,960
save carbon it might do quite the

1743
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,760
opposite you know if we make progress on

1744
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,559
controlling ddos attacks if we reduce

1745
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,440
the number of of uh what do they call it

1746
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,400
uh

1747
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,559
you know if we increase the ratio of

1748
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,559
good put to bad put

1749
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,400
the amount of uh the amount of energy

1750
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,520
that we could save doing that would be

1751
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,280
huge if we can figure out a way

1752
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,240
to

1753
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,280
get the

1754
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,640
bitcoin fiends to uh stop burning coal

1755
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,160
to make coins

1756
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,200
um

1757
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,599
we could easily save several orders of

1758
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,319
magnitude more carbon just by succeeding

1759
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,599
at that task

1760
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,200
not saying we can but

1761
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,799
you know maybe we could find a task like

1762
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,960
that so many orders of magnitude more

1763
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,960
carbon by by succeeding at that task

1764
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,079
than by addressing this particular

1765
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,160
problem this problem is

1766
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,160
relatively easy to address which makes

1767
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,440
it attractive

1768
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,880
but the point i was getting at is that

1769
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,240
it might be worth actually putting the

1770
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,480
effort into figuring out strategically

1771
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,479
what we could do as an organization that

1772
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:17,920
would actually

1773
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,719
make

1774
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,198
really major impacts like you know our

1775
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,520
best case scenario if

1776
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,080
the ietf is all four percent

1777
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,040
of

1778
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,560
you know the airline stuff is that we

1779
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,040
reduce global warming by 0.1 degrees c

1780
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,040
if we stopped coming to these meetings

1781
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,880
that's a very small number

1782
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,560
we need to reduce it by a lot more than

1783
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,560
that and i think that the people that

1784
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,319
come to the itf

1785
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,799
um have opportunities where they can

1786
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,640
actually do that kind of thing

1787
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,479
so so that's what i'm getting at when i

1788
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,238
say let's let's

1789
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,839
back off to 20 000 feet so to speak and

1790
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,679
think big what could we really do here

1791
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,040
that would really make a difference as

1792
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,319
opposed to what

1793
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,399
what's obvious and easy but might not

1794
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:01,278
make that big a difference

1795
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,920
well it's it's i mean

1796
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,238
it's one thing that um we don't have

1797
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:08,080
clear plan i mean um

1798
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,439
i'm happy

1799
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:12,000
i'm happy to have a better impact

1800
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,560
but so far i haven't hear a clear plan

1801
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,080
so it's always

1802
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,560
um easier to say we can do better but we

1803
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,719
do not things and

1804
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,960
i think that's something we should avoid

1805
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:30,799
one two three four okay

1806
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,839
uh hi daniel um i just want to uh

1807
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,439
basically say the same thing that ted

1808
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,600
said uh probably quicker thanks for

1809
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,719
doing this work thanks for thinking

1810
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,399
about it but everything else he said i

1811
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,319
completely agree with and i think you're

1812
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,600
right we should think about it and try

1813
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,198
to figure out what the plan is

1814
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:46,960
i think two and three are great one i'm

1815
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,679
not sure falls from the analysis you did

1816
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,080
and i'll leave with that thanks

1817
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,320
thank you thanks sean uh phil go ahead

1818
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,520
hi yeah

1819
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,280
uh i

1820
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,120
i think the way that we should start

1821
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,000
this is to first ask

1822
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,320
are three meetings the right number for

1823
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,760
itf

1824
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,199
um

1825
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,080
i mean

1826
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,159
i would much rather have one big meeting

1827
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,239
with everybody there a year

1828
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,520
rather than three with sparse attendance

1829
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,679
in person and so one of the things i

1830
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,360
think that we need to look at going

1831
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,480
forward is what the attendance is on

1832
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,440
site

1833
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,600
and if it doesn't pick up

1834
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,120
substantially

1835
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,199
we've got to revisit

1836
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,400
um

1837
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,440
i i i think at that point going to a one

1838
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,480
a year

1839
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,280
uh

1840
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,480
would become a pretty big argument

1841
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,600
having said that if we did that it would

1842
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,000
not save any co2

1843
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,800
because what would then happen is that

1844
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,800
the number of interim meetings would

1845
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,360
likely go up and people would then be

1846
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,159
flying to their interim meetings

1847
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,600
far fewer days spent abroad

1848
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,080
at itf meetings

1849
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,000
but just as many plane flights

1850
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,520
coming to the offsets question

1851
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,280
one of the amazing facts is that the

1852
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,480
amount of

1853
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,520
kerosene that is used for lighting

1854
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,320
is equal to the amount of kerosene that

1855
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,400
is used in the entire global

1856
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,880
aviation industry

1857
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,520
and that's a really easy

1858
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,199
offset to make because an led light

1859
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,320
powered

1860
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,040
by a solar panel

1861
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,480
costs less than a gas lamp to provide

1862
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,840
and

1863
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,920
doesn't require the kerosene that costs

1864
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,280
the users

1865
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,199
a huge amount of money most of the

1866
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,840
kerosene lanterns are used in sub

1867
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,840
saharan africa

1868
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,239
they're smelly they're dirty their

1869
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,520
health hazard

1870
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,600
and so maybe if we got into that form of

1871
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,640
um

1872
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,320
carbon offset

1873
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,040
um

1874
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,120
you know as an itf

1875
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,239
wide made that easy maybe that would be

1876
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,719
some way to improve the carbon offsets

1877
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,000
system

1878
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,360
um

1879
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,960
and finally on the cryptocurrency system

1880
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,600
uh at this point i would absolutely

1881
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,600
sincerely like to see

1882
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,800
switchblade loitering munitions used to

1883
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,920
take out bitcoin mining operations i

1884
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,800
want to destroy them with drones emp

1885
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,080
strikes the lot i am fed up

1886
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,719
of them they're a bunch of fascists and

1887
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:36,400
i do not want to

1888
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:41,000
see them survive they're awful

1889
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,320
let's go

1890
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,040
uh nick uh go you're the last one to go

1891
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,440
please go ahead

1892
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,159
uh yeah i think thanks for this

1893
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,300
presentation and um

1894
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,120
[Music]

1895
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,120
uh this is this is a useful discussion

1896
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,440
even if uh sometimes i find the

1897
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,080
reactions frustrating um

1898
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:16,960
i think it's a really useful

1899
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,080
presentation because i think you're

1900
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,080
getting at um

1901
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,480
some good data on

1902
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,799
um

1903
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,640
on what

1904
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,679
sorts of emissions are coming from uh

1905
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:31,600
from flights and that can

1906
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,000
help us like have some baselines and and

1907
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,600
comparisons and that will make it easier

1908
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,679
for us to actually measure the impacts

1909
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,960
of of these different uh conclusions and

1910
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,199
and maybe we would have different uh

1911
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:46,239
alternatives for um how we do itaf

1912
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,360
meetings whether it's the number of

1913
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,640
meetings or who travels to which

1914
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,840
meetings or

1915
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,560
different things like that but um

1916
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,239
i think having those numbers uh will be

1917
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,480
really useful um i i do think there's

1918
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,840
some useful feedback we're hearing about

1919
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,080
how to present that information most

1920
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,760
effectively and if we wanted to have

1921
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,400
like a sort of ongoing dashboard or have

1922
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,040
a document or have a report or something

1923
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,199
maybe we could give you some

1924
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,280
useful feedback on the best ways to

1925
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,480
present that

1926
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,719
um i i've certainly found some of the

1927
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:19,360
reactions frustrating um this time and

1928
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,280
and every else

1929
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,120
every other time that we've discussed

1930
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,199
this uh that emissions are always

1931
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:28,400
someone else's fault not us or we do

1932
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,320
such good things that our emissions are

1933
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,719
actually saving long-term emissions i

1934
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,239
certainly hear that from from every

1935
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,080
group that discusses this topic not just

1936
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,520
itf

1937
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,280
um i think everyone thinks that their

1938
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,239
travel really is important um

1939
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:43,760
but but it might also just be useful

1940
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,920
that like hey we can start to write down

1941
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,120
some of those

1942
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,960
uh discussions since we've had them so

1943
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,360
many times uh and and consider those

1944
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,280
arguments and and maybe there's a useful

1945
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,440
like work item there too

1946
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,719
um

1947
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:58,320
i i

1948
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,920
i know those are difficult discussions

1949
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,440
and i know we're having them repeatedly

1950
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,080
and maybe it's worth trying to start uh

1951
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,159
writing them down um and and that might

1952
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,880
get us to better conclusions in in the

1953
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,960
long run um

1954
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,080
so so so thank you for for doing this

1955
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,040
and and i hope we can turn it into some

1956
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,360
sort of more systematic approach or

1957
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,840
maybe um or maybe it'll be useful data

1958
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,280
for what jay is going to talk to us

1959
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,239
about as well

1960
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,480
thanks

1961
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,199
thank you again thanks for your vote on

1962
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,199
this

1963
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,519
and

1964
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,640
jay if you're out there

1965
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,520
i think you're supposed to

1966
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,800
each other

1967
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,760
i don't know if that's possible

1968
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,199
i think this is just a monitor

1969
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,140
yeah i'm just passing it on

1970
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,679
[Music]

1971
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:24,159
yeah done

1972
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,040
thanks um

1973
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,600
right so um

1974
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,520
i'm gonna um

1975
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,400
talk

1976
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,759
assuming this works again

1977
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,600
about um

1978
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,840
what we're doing about carbon emissions

1979
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,640
um

1980
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,880
within the llc and

1981
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,280
what we've been thinking about so

1982
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,560
we started doing some work back in

1983
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,159
2020 about this and put it on hold when

1984
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:03,440
everything moved towards online meetings

1985
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,960
and we recently picked it up again i

1986
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,320
discussed this with daniel a couple of

1987
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,920
years ago so

1988
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,960
um

1989
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,120
the i'm going to separate this out into

1990
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,040
two elements one is measuring carbon

1991
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,880
emissions and the second one is about

1992
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,120
offsetting carbon emissions

1993
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,560
the

1994
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,880
all right thank you um

1995
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,880
the

1996
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,360
i'm working on the basis that

1997
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,239
we're always going to be emitting carbon

1998
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,800
and at least until we are net zero

1999
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,239
and so carbon offset remains a

2000
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:35,440
um

2001
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,320
a potential strategy to use even if the

2002
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,320
number of meetings is reduced and that

2003
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,440
anything to do with the number of

2004
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,880
meetings is

2005
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,480
outside of scope for me to be

2006
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,780
particularly interested in

2007
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,080
[Music]

2008
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,040
so the work to date so far is that we've

2009
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,719
used consultants to calculate emissions

2010
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:55,840
for the last six on-site meetings it's a

2011
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,679
simple methodology assumes travel from

2012
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,840
the capital city of each country and

2013
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,440
economy flights

2014
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,840
we use event venue emissions based on

2015
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,760
the area of event space that we rent out

2016
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,679
and the hotel emissions on the base on

2017
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:11,920
the number of estimated room nights that

2018
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,920
we have for attendees

2019
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,239
we use international standards

2020
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:20,719
ghg is the greenhouse gas protocol

2021
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,320
it's a the standards body for

2022
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,159
carbon emissions and so this is from

2023
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,760
their admission factors for cross-sector

2024
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,239
tools and the assumptions about energy

2025
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,080
use that then

2026
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,920
feed into those for

2027
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,920
venues and hotels are based on the

2028
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,679
commercial building energy consumption

2029
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,640
survey data

2030
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,800
so these are the

2031
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,480
figures that we have in metric tons of

2032
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:48,000
co2 emitted for the previous six

2033
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,159
meetings in terms of total carbon

2034
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,520
emissions

2035
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,000
um

2036
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,920
equivalent carbon equivalent so as you

2037
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,920
can see this is into air travel is

2038
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,640
basically the big one here um and

2039
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,120
singapore is um

2040
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,600
six thousand you know is much larger

2041
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,840
than say montreal because of the

2042
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,360
geographical nature of the people that

2043
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,840
we have coming

2044
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,800
what i'd like to do on

2045
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,280
carbon calculations in future

2046
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,000
is have correct city rather than just

2047
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,840
assume the capital city

2048
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,000
take into account the mode and class of

2049
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,679
transport because business class is um

2050
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,920
much higher emissions than economy

2051
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,960
and take into account the route um

2052
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,640
and by mode i mean the whether people

2053
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,159
are traveling by train or traveling by

2054
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:38,320
air as well now of course that relies on

2055
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,480
people giving us that data but if we get

2056
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,000
that data then we can actually get

2057
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,520
something quite there

2058
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,440
quite um clear

2059
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,600
and i'd also like to look at

2060
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,440
calculations around the non-meeting

2061
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,400
operations and to use the calculation

2062
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,840
standards as they develop because the

2063
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,080
calculation standards are changing all

2064
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,000
of the time there's a concept for

2065
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,080
example in air travel called i think

2066
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,120
pushed carbon which is

2067
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,640
why people one of the reasons that

2068
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,320
people think that air travel is actually

2069
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,760
worse for carbon emissions than we

2070
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,760
currently think it is and so people are

2071
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,159
looking to develop standards around that

2072
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:13,040
and

2073
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,719
i'm

2074
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,159
this talk has been brought forward i

2075
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,000
wasn't planning to do this yet and i was

2076
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,440
planning to have a discussion about this

2077
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,880
but the questions that i would like to

2078
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,159
ask the community which you can answer

2079
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,239
now or i'll try to do it at some point

2080
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,280
are

2081
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,679
look i don't think but hey well are

2082
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,520
there any objections to llc just getting

2083
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,120
on with the measurement

2084
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,880
all right i don't if there is let me

2085
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,400
know and what role is there for the

2086
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,560
community in this and when i wrote this

2087
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,800
i didn't really know about um daniel's

2088
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,000
work though daniel and i have spoken

2089
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,760
about this for some time

2090
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,719
so

2091
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:45,360
that's number one is about measuring our

2092
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,839
emissions

2093
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,480
so the second part is about offsetting

2094
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,639
and i haven't done anything on this so

2095
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,440
far except to identify consultants who

2096
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,760
can help us with this as

2097
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,600
i think george said earlier this a

2098
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,800
couple of you said this is quite a

2099
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,440
complicated area and so

2100
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,880
i think it would be useful for us just

2101
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,320
to have consultants who can provide

2102
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,719
educational material who can contribute

2103
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,400
to community discussions such as this

2104
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,480
and who can research the market if we

2105
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,239
chose to go ahead with offsetting

2106
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,639
because it is quite complex so we have

2107
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:21,360
some some people who can help us do that

2108
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,159
and the questions i need to ask are

2109
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:26,080
what kind of consent community consensus

2110
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,679
is needed to offset now in case it's not

2111
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:31,440
clear i'm not

2112
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,440
i want to avoid any discussion on

2113
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,199
whether or not climate change is real i

2114
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,800
think we all want to avoid that let's

2115
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,679
just assume it is okay so this isn't

2116
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:42,239
about um do we need to do anything about

2117
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,239
it it's about whether offsetting is a

2118
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:46,800
way to do something about it so

2119
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,320
i'm not it's not clear to me what kind

2120
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,800
of community census is needed none

2121
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,080
whether the

2122
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,480
llc can simply just pay

2123
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,360
an offsetting fee after each meeting

2124
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,239
that we think um offsets our estimation

2125
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,639
of carbon emissions um

2126
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:03,600
and

2127
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,280
obviously determining what kind of

2128
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,560
scheme is uh some effort behind that

2129
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,600
or whether we need consensus to do that

2130
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,920
whether there's need some policy guiding

2131
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,360
how we offset

2132
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,520
because as philip said and was quite

2133
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,840
right kerosene lamps are one of the

2134
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,600
biggest

2135
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,400
sources of carbon emissions and

2136
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,880
it seems a bit strange but investing in

2137
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,199
throwing away carbon kerosene lamps and

2138
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,440
buying led lights for people really can

2139
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,280
change things but it's

2140
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,960
not the same way not the way that many

2141
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,679
people see this which they think is that

2142
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,679
good offsetting is like buying some

2143
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:41,520
rainforest for example or replanting

2144
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,679
some rainforest that kind of stuff

2145
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,480
and then um the final one is do we need

2146
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,080
some kind of policy or consensus on the

2147
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,159
chosen methods and schemes you know what

2148
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,719
level we need to go to so and i i'm not

2149
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,080
clear about that so

2150
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,840
i my my plan had been simply to

2151
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,440
write this up a little bit more detailed

2152
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,840
than this and then actually go to the

2153
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,920
admin discuss list and ask people right

2154
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,920
what do we do about this and how do we

2155
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,040
take this forward and then get some

2156
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,040
answers which may that have meant

2157
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,560
coming back here or going to gen

2158
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,320
dispatch or something like that so

2159
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,560
that's where i am so far

2160
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,000
um any questions at

2161
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,520
i all go ahead

2162
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,320
no i i'm jumping

2163
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,880
so so uh one thing to maybe add to the

2164
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,520
to the bottom set of bullets would be

2165
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,480
what percentage of offset do you want

2166
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,080
so i mean the natural assumption is well

2167
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,159
we should just do 100 right because like

2168
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:36,960
you know

2169
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,800
that that mitigates the damage maybe

2170
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,400
more than that would be better

2171
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,679
maybe less than that we but i don't

2172
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,199
think less than that would be better but

2173
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:44,880
but if you if you really care about this

2174
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,320
problem then it kind of makes sense to

2175
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,159
ask that question like like could the

2176
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,239
ietf meeting actually be a net benefit

2177
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,840
as opposed to it just break even um

2178
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,320
and the other thing is uh you know the

2179
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,520
one thing that i would want you to be

2180
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,800
really careful about and i don't know

2181
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,679
whether

2182
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:00,800
i don't actually know the answer to

2183
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,239
those questions like should i have a say

2184
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:03,760
in this or am i just some jerk talking

2185
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,560
at the mic probably the latter but um

2186
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,719
but i'd really like

2187
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:10,800
whoever does this work to make

2188
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,639
absolutely sure that the carbon offsets

2189
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,080
are actually doing something so for

2190
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,159
example you use the example of buying

2191
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,600
rainforest and i think that a lot of

2192
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,280
that is actually like

2193
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,880
highly questionable

2194
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,840
um and so uh but also like you know

2195
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,320
relief efforts are often sort of

2196
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,880
very paternalistic and don't actually

2197
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,400
address the needs of people and so they

2198
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,080
wind up you know you wind up with with

2199
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,880
like led lights that that the battery

2200
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,239
runs out they can't figure out how to

2201
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:37,520
get it working again and it winds up

2202
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,280
just just going in a trash heap but now

2203
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,639
you've just created some trash and not

2204
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:42,639
actually offset the carbon so i'd really

2205
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,120
like it if if that does happen that it'd

2206
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,960
be very carefully done and that we know

2207
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,719
for sure and that would be able to have

2208
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,480
you know reports on whether whether this

2209
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:51,920
is a success and

2210
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,000
and metrics and and change if it turns

2211
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,679
out that the thing we chose

2212
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,120
actually sucked

2213
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,040
that there are um

2214
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,520
schemes for accrediting um carbon asset

2215
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,280
stuff and i i would like us to be able

2216
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,440
to bring in these consultants to have

2217
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,120
conversations with us and explain that

2218
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,360
accreditation explain those schemes and

2219
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,800
us to have a broader conversation to

2220
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,480
avoid exactly what you're describing

2221
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,000
there yeah my worry with the

2222
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,520
accreditation guys is that

2223
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,760
they better present some pretty detailed

2224
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,920
data that we can validate ourselves as

2225
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,360
opposed to us just believing them

2226
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,800
because

2227
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,600
you know it's a great business to be in

2228
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,400
okay thanks

2229
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,440
all right good morning go ahead yeah

2230
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:37,280
martin duke google um is there a

2231
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,800
precedent for

2232
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,400
the llc

2233
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,000
embarking on sort of corporate social

2234
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,320
responsibility spending

2235
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,360
no no okay so this is this is virgin

2236
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,920
territory hey i i just want to say that

2237
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,280
that's not entirely this is sean turner

2238
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,960
i'm sorry to jump in there that's not

2239
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,719
entirely true we do have some esg um

2240
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:59,199
you know equitable equitable um ethical

2241
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,360
investing that's part of our portfolio

2242
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,280
already with the um

2243
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,120
the the money that we have so it's it's

2244
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,520
not entirely to say no

2245
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,719
and we also have um plans for child care

2246
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:12,719
at um on-site meetings and things as

2247
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,719
well so okay so that was that was that

2248
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,639
didn't go through a formal con consensus

2249
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,080
process

2250
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,239
not aware of that okay well then i mean

2251
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:22,719
i i would say that you're probably

2252
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:23,840
i mean it's always great to get

2253
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,719
community input but i don't i don't

2254
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:30,159
i personally don't think we need to

2255
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:31,760
go through the whole

2256
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,719
formal

2257
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,600
thing

2258
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,600
um

2259
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,120
uh

2260
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,600
so the my other comment is kind of

2261
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,199
wishy-washy because i don't know what

2262
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,040
what to what to think about exactly but

2263
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,320
but the

2264
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,040
the itf obviously is a

2265
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,760
relatively financially constrained

2266
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,440
nonprofit and

2267
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,800
a lot of the

2268
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,120
attendees are

2269
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,760
extremely profitable corporations

2270
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,679
who could certainly choose

2271
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:03,840
to offset their carbon emissions of

2272
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,159
their employees coming to itf

2273
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,400
and um certainly would be sort of a net

2274
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,560
win if we could leverage that instead of

2275
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,080
ietf funds

2276
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,320
in terms of sort of the economic justice

2277
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,600
of the whole thing

2278
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,760
um i don't know how to do that so i'm

2279
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,440
not going to say we should do that and

2280
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,199
as opposed to what you're saying

2281
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,040
but if there's some way to partner with

2282
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,480
some of these

2283
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,040
sponsors that strikes me as a as a

2284
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,280
particularly efficient way to do so so

2285
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,400
thank you i thought about that and it's

2286
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,480
quite complicated to do

2287
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,400
and it's probably more beneficial we

2288
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,880
simply er on the side of double counting

2289
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,520
and double offset yep and then achieves

2290
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,080
ted's point of offsetting beyond 100

2291
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,199
that sounds reasonable thanks thanks

2292
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,800
thank you

2293
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,360
uh nick

2294
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,960
thank you for doing this and um i i know

2295
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,719
that we're talking pretty

2296
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,719
quickly about the offsetting side but

2297
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,560
actually i think the measuring side was

2298
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,080
the more useful

2299
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,719
uh conclusion um

2300
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,560
i i appreciate that you you've done this

2301
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,560
already with with travel versus other

2302
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,040
emissions of the meetings and and as i

2303
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,239
think we've heard from other people we

2304
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:17,520
want to focus on the things that are

2305
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,000
most important and

2306
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,840
and certainly as i would expect it but i

2307
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,120
appreciate that you have data for it

2308
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,000
that the travel to meetings is thousands

2309
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,639
of times more impactful than the hotel

2310
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:31,280
emissions et cetera

2311
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,320
great

2312
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,800
good to know um i i think it would be

2313
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,719
really useful to continue that uh

2314
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:38,480
measurement and that i would focus more

2315
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,800
on the measurement than the offsetting

2316
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,639
both because i think we need to reduce

2317
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,719
emissions not just offset them for many

2318
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:45,679
of the

2319
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:47,520
uh challenges of

2320
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,360
effective offsets that that people have

2321
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,679
discussed um

2322
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,760
and and because you know the situation

2323
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,320
is now very urgent as i think we've

2324
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,480
heard from the ipcc so we need to do

2325
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,400
some reductions

2326
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,120
so i i would certainly encourage ietf to

2327
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,120
continue with the

2328
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,360
measurement and maybe documenting that

2329
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,600
and sharing that with the full community

2330
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,639
not just

2331
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,000
schmoo

2332
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,080
would would be

2333
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,679
very useful um

2334
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:18,080
it'll create some of that same pushback

2335
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,880
or reaction but i think the data will be

2336
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,239
very useful and i hope you'll do it

2337
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,719
without needing our consensus for you to

2338
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,560
do it

2339
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,960
yeah thanks nick um yeah i agree with

2340
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,560
you about the measurement i

2341
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,239
have to admit i thought i had actually

2342
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,920
actually blogged those measurements when

2343
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,320
we had them done in 2020 i found out

2344
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,080
last week i hadn't so sorry for sitting

2345
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:41,360
on those for that long but yeah

2346
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,000
thanks nick um so yeah i kind of like in

2347
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,760
the same borders like nick and like a

2348
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,520
little bit on the same house like mutton

2349
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,199
before as well so like yeah i think the

2350
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,360
measurement is really good and i think

2351
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,440
like it as it came up from like daniel's

2352
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,920
presentation um also look at like you

2353
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,360
know how much like you know how do you

2354
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,800
quantify something for the remote

2355
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,320
participant store right like so we can

2356
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,199
measure

2357
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:04,480
uh how that works and uh for the

2358
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,080
action part on the off setting right

2359
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,639
like i kind of like uh took like that's

2360
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,159
point into mind and i think it's it'll

2361
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:14,080
be good to have a community consultation

2362
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,520
process like i don't know about whether

2363
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,280
consensus is needed or not but at least

2364
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,320
like you know put up like you know what

2365
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,159
you're thinking off and so on and try to

2366
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:21,600
get input from the community on what

2367
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,520
they think right like see if somebody

2368
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,360
has experiences from some of that before

2369
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,719
so the consultation would be really

2370
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,159
useful i think no matter what you do

2371
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:30,880
otherwise thank you

2372
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,199
thanks

2373
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,280
yeah live second i'm speaking for a

2374
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,960
moment as one of the the directors on

2375
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,639
the board of the llc right so i think

2376
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,440
technically um it's it's in the scope of

2377
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,560
the lc board to manage the the carbon uh

2378
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,400
cost of of the organization already um i

2379
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,320
still think we probably prefer to have

2380
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,320
some explicit sort of

2381
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,840
indication from the community that they

2382
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,840
would encourage us to do so and maybe

2383
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,840
actively to to manage that cost so i

2384
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,280
think that i would

2385
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,639
like to see

2386
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:02,960
i think we're probably prepared to at

2387
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,639
the plenary or in some other form report

2388
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:06,400
on something that we're doing when it's

2389
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,239
sort of something specific is there to

2390
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:09,360
report

2391
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,920
but i would caution that we don't sort

2392
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,719
of micromanage what the llc board should

2393
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,560
investigate but you can all you have an

2394
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,000
email address you can send us

2395
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,440
suggestions but i i don't think we

2396
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,760
should like design this by committee and

2397
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,360
rather sort of

2398
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,520
basically us again the community tell

2399
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,120
the lc but we want you to actively do

2400
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,639
something here let us know what you're

2401
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:30,400
doing and then you know

2402
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,320
make good choices that spencer would say

2403
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,639
thank you

2404
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,480
pete resnick yeah i said in the chat

2405
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,840
room but i thought i would just say it

2406
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,199
so that others hear it um the llc was

2407
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:44,400
designed

2408
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,360
so that the community didn't have to

2409
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,280
come to consensus for every business

2410
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,679
decision whether it's where our meetings

2411
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,600
are held or what tooling we're going to

2412
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,679
have and all this stuff that's why we

2413
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,719
have the llc as a separate entity and so

2414
01:31:58,719 --> 01:31:59,600
doing

2415
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,520
something for carbon emissions it's got

2416
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,760
to be reviewable by the community you've

2417
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,239
got to be transparent about it and we

2418
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,000
can give you feedback and say no please

2419
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
don't do that anymore or yes do more of

2420
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,480
that but getting consensus ahead of time

2421
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,080
is not required

2422
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,320
thanks

2423
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,600
hi brian drammell uh google plus one to

2424
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,920
what pete said however as as lars was

2425
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,159
was speaking about yeah it probably does

2426
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:26,400
make sense to have some venue for the

2427
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,719
community to provide input on this

2428
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,560
is this working group not that venue i

2429
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,159
mean like this would be the place for

2430
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,840
people who are interested in the

2431
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,000
machinery of how we meet

2432
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,400
and this looks like it very much

2433
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,400
yeah so is related to that

2434
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,400
i agree um but i also think that that

2435
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,360
once

2436
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,199
the llc would start to actively do

2437
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,400
something it could take the form of a

2438
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,159
plenary presentation for example in

2439
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,880
addition to having maybe some more

2440
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,639
nitty gritty reporting here if this

2441
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,800
community desires that right yeah but i

2442
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,920
would think that the nitty-gritty

2443
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,440
reporting i would want to show up here

2444
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,199
because we already have the video so

2445
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,920
i would like to have input from

2446
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,600
community people

2447
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,960
when we have you know some kind of

2448
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,719
workshops or something with these

2449
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:09,360
consultants you know there's a lot of

2450
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,120
things we think about people bring lots

2451
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,320
of different points of view and think

2452
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,000
quite hard about stuff and i think

2453
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,360
together we can probably end up with

2454
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,560
something better than if it was just

2455
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,080
left to me to do

2456
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,120
so lars i know you don't want to

2457
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,120
micromanage the llc but i got to speak i

2458
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,199
gotta put in one vote for the fire up

2459
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,360
the uh iatf air force and bomb the

2460
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,199
bitcoins guys

2461
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:30,159
like php suggesting no seriously um

2462
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:32,159
the um

2463
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:33,840
so i actually think about this a little

2464
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,600
more um

2465
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,120
in terms of like who you need to get

2466
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,880
permission from it strikes me at the it

2467
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,239
depends what the incidents oh this is

2468
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:41,600
going to cost money

2469
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,960
the question is where the incidence that

2470
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,159
falls on if like donors absorb this then

2471
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,239
obviously this is a donor thing whereas

2472
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,000
if this is just like directly tacked on

2473
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,320
to the price of you know of

2474
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,080
of the meeting fee then that's a

2475
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,000
community issue right yeah no it's

2476
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,199
absorbed

2477
01:33:57,199 --> 01:34:01,599
okay well in that case yeah i mean uh

2478
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,320
in that case like i i i don't see why

2479
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,600
well i i don't know that um

2480
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,960
community objections really have a ton

2481
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,400
of standing i mean like in principle you

2482
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,159
could use the money instead to like

2483
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:15,360
lower meaning fees or something but but

2484
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,880
if it's not gonna actually affect people

2485
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,239
the status quo of what people are

2486
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:21,280
experiencing at meetings

2487
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,440
i mean thank you one argument to make is

2488
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,960
that the llc board is supposed to

2489
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,800
steward the organization right and part

2490
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,239
of that is like maybe making sure that

2491
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:30,560
there's a planet to have meetings on

2492
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,560
in the future and so that you can argue

2493
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,320
that carbon offsetting or some way to

2494
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,920
manage the carbon footprint is therefore

2495
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,040
inherently

2496
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,199
something that that we're trying to do

2497
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:40,719
yeah no i i think that's that's a

2498
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,400
reasonable argument and i guess my point

2499
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,239
is that as a as a

2500
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:47,600
potentially completely indifferent

2501
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,320
attendee at ietf like nothing is

2502
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,679
changing but behind the curtain there's

2503
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:53,920
some offsetting going on well great like

2504
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,360
if you're saying i'm going to jack up

2505
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:58,400
your attendancy by 250

2506
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,920
then at least i have something to be mad

2507
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,080
about no i mean right i don't i don't

2508
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,760
know if you're prepared to say anything

2509
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,280
about financials i think there was some

2510
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,159
initial numbers that were basically

2511
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:10,320
not at a level where

2512
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,480
you know i can take a guess i mean take

2513
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,679
a guess yeah i think we're looking at

2514
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:15,360
about thirty thousand dollars offset

2515
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,679
cost per meeting which is a fraction

2516
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,280
tiny fraction of the cost oh well then

2517
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,800
well then why are we talking about let's

2518
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,119
just do it yeah no um okay very very

2519
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,719
well yeah like i said

2520
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,360
like i said i mean ultimately the actual

2521
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,119
impact on the organization whether it be

2522
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:34,960
donors or do you know ultimately your

2523
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,800
steward is the donor's money

2524
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,080
and so if i i i imagine you've already

2525
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,280
consulted them um or we'll do soon

2526
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,480
anyway

2527
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,718
um

2528
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:48,480
yeah

2529
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,880
sorry i'm saying again but but lastly

2530
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,800
yeah so like if there's if there's no

2531
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,000
impact on attendees then

2532
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,280
it seems like a pretty minor thing

2533
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,639
all right thank you no more cookies

2534
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:05,840
i think uh

2535
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,840
i think mallory are up next uh don't get

2536
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,360
between people on the cookies i think

2537
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:12,400
this is going to backfire

2538
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,520
um yeah i'm actually coming to the queue

2539
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,800
with um chair hat on i think that based

2540
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,040
on the charter this is work that's in

2541
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,400
scope and

2542
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,360
um

2543
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,159
previously to a comment i made

2544
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:27,679
daniel slides

2545
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,719
guidance for individuals um or companies

2546
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,639
to make decisions about whether or not

2547
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:35,280
um to participate remotely or in person

2548
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,360
this could be very useful so while

2549
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,800
everyone is

2550
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,280
including myself um encouraging you to

2551
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,280
keep doing this work and make decisions

2552
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,800
within um

2553
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,119
the mandate of the llc without having to

2554
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:49,520
consult i do hope that you um stay in

2555
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,760
touch and bring some of this work back

2556
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,440
to schmoo

2557
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,000
and to think about

2558
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,440
what kind of guidance that might look

2559
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,760
like so thanks a lot jay

2560
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,080
thanks

2561
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,400
thank you

2562
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,480
nick did you have something else to say

2563
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,840
or was your hand up from the previous

2564
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,679
time

2565
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:11,760
uh no i i had something else i i was

2566
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,920
curious whether um

2567
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,159
i i think we heard a few times that oh

2568
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:17,840
maybe this should be part of a larger

2569
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,520
discussion either because we should be

2570
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,440
looking at um

2571
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,080
other benefits or other uh

2572
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,520
emissions impacts or we should be

2573
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,760
working with other organizations

2574
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,159
um so that we have some coordinated

2575
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,560
response that i think i heard that uh

2576
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,920
sort of feedback that people wanted to

2577
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,239
only uh decrease our emissions if we

2578
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:39,920
were doing it in a coordinated way with

2579
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:40,719
others

2580
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,000
and so i was curious if that

2581
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,840
conversation needs to happen somewhere

2582
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:44,800
else or

2583
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,080
um

2584
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,080
if that should be ietf wide or working

2585
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:48,880
with

2586
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,320
other organizations outside ietf

2587
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,159
and how we want to what our next step

2588
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:56,879
should be for that

2589
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,040
so i don't know that we've engaged in

2590
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,480
active discussions yet with other

2591
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,400
organizations but we are regularly

2592
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,800
talking to like um

2593
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,440
isoc and icann and the rars and and

2594
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,440
organizations like that little w3c and

2595
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,880
we can certainly

2596
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,880
uh put it on the agenda for one of those

2597
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,719
sort of joint discussions to see if

2598
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:18,639
they're doing anything yet

2599
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:20,239
inform them maybe of what we're planning

2600
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:21,840
to do and see if there's any synergies

2601
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,280
you know they might have good ideas that

2602
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,239
we didn't have yet

2603
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,560
i think that would be very helpful thank

2604
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,480
you

2605
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,880
hey lars do you know like by any chance

2606
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,800
of this open stand thing we started like

2607
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,560
you know about a decade ago is it still

2608
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,480
in place like is there something we talk

2609
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,800
to those bodies

2610
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,040
there's a web page but it's been pretty

2611
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,040
quiet um i think we're much more

2612
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:47,199
frequently talking to the organization i

2613
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,960
mentioned earlier that sort of their

2614
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,360
colloquially called the istar

2615
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,960
