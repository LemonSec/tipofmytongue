right now we don't have any uh working

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
group documents so it's a slight one

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,400
then we're going to have set talking

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,120
about ipv4 polishing at the etf

100
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,759
thread with rfp parcels

101
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,759
luigi for internet address gaps

102
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,360
then we have the ip regional internet

103
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,000
blocking considerations by lenny

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,720
semantic ip addressing for satellite

105
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,880
higher layer address aggregation by tony

106
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
and service routing in multi-access edge

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
computing

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,919
so

109
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,400
all these presentations uh are

110
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,120
individual presentations uh so far we

111
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,199
don't have any any working group

112
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,400
document

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
so it'll be they will be treated as

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,919
individual contributions all of them

115
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,360
uh

116
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,919
we may do a little adjustment on the

117
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,440
agenda or

118
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
down the road depending on who's present

119
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,960
because there are some people that need

120
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
to be in two rooms at the same time

121
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
but uh we will try to stick to this

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,840
order are there any questions

123
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,199

okay thank you

139
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,440
hello everyone

140
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
this is a

141
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
new draft from our

142
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,520
collaboration on

143
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,720
ipv4 unicast extensions

144
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
so as people will recall

145
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
in november we presented

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
um

147
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,639
in november we presented

148
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,840
the first two of a set of four drafts on

149
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,479
our goal of conserving ipv4 address

150
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,400
space

151
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
and we wanted to continue

152
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,840
presenting the remaining two drafts but

153
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
there were a number of concerns that

154
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,639
were raised

155
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,840
in the november meeting

156
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,599
and

157
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,199
as i'll discuss

158
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,639
in a few moments in our view the

159
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,720
heart of most of the concerns that

160
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,759
people had with our drafts was about the

161
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,759
appropriateness of working

162
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,639
on ipv4 and maintaining ipv4 in the ietf

163
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,160
and so we wanted to go to the heart of

164
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
the matter and see if consensus could be

165
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
found about that

166
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,960
deeper more fundamental question

167
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,800
so we have a new draft that attempts to

168
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,479
address this

169
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,240
we posted it there's already been some

170
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,319
discussion

171
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,080
the people who've commented so far were

172
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,120
not

173
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
very pleased or positive for this but

174
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,280
i'm going to go through it and

175
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,879
hope to help people understand it and

176
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,039
hope people can help us understand

177
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,800
their concerns

178
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,599
so our draft talks about the

179
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,319
itf's historic role

180
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
as the steward of ipv4

181
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,280
talks about challenges that have been

182
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,800
raised in the ipv6 era

183
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,280
to the itf's role in continuing to

184
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,039
maintain and develop ipv4

185
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,080
notes that neglecting ipv4 is not our

186
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
transition strategy

187
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,240
and is not a strategy for

188
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,639
causing the adoption of ipv6

189
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
describes

190
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,800
the likelihood and experiences

191
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,720
indicating that ipv4

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,319
requires and will require ongoing

193
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,800
maintenance

194
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
and notes that the itf is in a unique

195
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,479
position as the historic steward of ipv4

196
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,559
as the home of the most expertise as the

197
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,120
most conspicuous point of coordination

198
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,800
for ipv4 and compatibility

199
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
and that itf has unique structure and

200
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,240
unique values that are

201
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,680
historically well suited to

202
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,760
consensus-based

203
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,519
maintenance of ipv4 and related

204
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,080
technologies

205
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
so as i said

206
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,720
this was inspired by our presentation of

207
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,200
these proposals i'm going to

208
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,040
not talk very much about these proposals

209
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,959
but just clarify a couple of points as

210
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,040
they relate to this

211
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,519
but mostly going to talk about the ipv4

212
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,839
question

213
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
so i did want to clarify something that

214
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,240
a lot of people seemed not

215
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
um

216
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
not especially cognizant of that hadn't

217
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,000
come up very much in the discussions

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,480
which is that the locus local

219
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,519
pardon me

220
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,880
the lowest

221
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,200
address fix proposed in one of our four

222
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,279
drafts

223
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,519
is a fix that can be made locally with

224
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,080
internet-wide benefits

225
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,320
so the lowest address is already

226
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
interoperable across the internet with

227
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
distant networks

228
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
if it's fixed to be

229
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,800
supported within any individual local

230
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
segment

231
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,600
it raises no allocation policy questions

232
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,040
it's already backwards compatible for

233
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
distant networks

234
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,640
and operators of local area networks can

235
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
make use of it whenever they know that

236
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,079
the devices on their networks support it

237
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,560
and so to the extent that people have

238
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
concerns about allocation policy or

239
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
about the difficulties in achieving

240
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,360
internet-wide coordination

241
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
that draft doesn't raise those concerns

242
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
it does of course raise the concern of

243
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,160
whether the itf

244
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
can properly continue to fix

245
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,959
things in ipv4 whether it's worth it

246
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,880
whether it's appropriate and so on and

247
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
so again that's some of the motivation

248
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,120
here

249
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,640
so there's been

250
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,240
some disagreement about how

251
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
large or how exclusive this concern was

252
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,079
but we perceived that a very very

253
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,720
substantial amount of the objection or

254
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
the concern about our proposals in

255
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
november was based on the fact that

256
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,800
they're ipv4 specific fixes

257
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,640
people said a lot of things that were

258
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,120
quite disparaging toward ipv4 toward

259
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,760
continued engineering work on ipv4

260
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,760
toward the role of such work in the ietf

261
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,800
and the the strongest concerns that we

262
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
noticed and the most frequently stated

263
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
that we noticed appeared to be versions

264
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,160
of

265
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
should the ietf still work on fixing

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,160
ipv4 why should the itf still work on

267
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,920
fixing ipv4

268
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,880
or

269
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,680
the sort of

270
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,360
this will only benefit ipv4 users who

271
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,120
are using an obsolete protocol and

272
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,640
should just switch to ipv6

273
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,040
now

274
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,760
the ietf's role in maintaining ipv4 has

275
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,279
been questioned before

276
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,279
one of the main outputs from the sunset

277
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,640
4 working group

278
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,680
in 2006 proposed that ipv4 should be

279
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,279
declared historic

280
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,760
and that itf should

281
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,920
for the most part cease to work on it

282
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,120
people online are saying that if you

283
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
could uh move a little bit away from

284
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,519
your mic because it's getting

285
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,680
saturated thank you

286
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,760
uh maybe like this

287
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,360
hopefully this is all right

288
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,279
yes thanks thanks for the feedback sorry

289
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,600
about that

290
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,079
yeah so

291
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,920
a main output of the sunset four working

292
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,880
group in 2016 made this proposal

293
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,160
and this went for

294
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,519
um

295
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,360
went up for review as an ietf wide

296
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
consensus and the community had quite

297
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,560
substantial

298
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,079
concerns about it and it didn't reach a

299
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,519
consensus

300
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,680
and so our hope is to see if the

301
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,920
opposite consensus can be found that is

302
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,760
people had objections

303
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,000
to the idea that ietf

304
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,480
should not do this work

305
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,399
we're wondering if people could perhaps

306
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,320
agree that the itf in fact should do

307
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
this work

308
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,839
and should continue to have this role

309
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,800
so ipv4 of course is still the most used

310
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,440
network layer protocol in the world

311
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,079
the ietf is the recognized and historic

312
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,519
authority on all coordination and

313
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,600
interoperability questions for that

314
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,040
protocol

315
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,480
those questions continue to arise

316
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
our draft identified 10 rfcs over the

317
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,000
past decade or so that impact

318
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
ipv4 implementation some of which are

319
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,120
also applicable to ipv6

320
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,079
but that in our view made changes to the

321
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,360
protocol

322
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,279
or fixed things that needed to be fixed

323
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,639
in the protocol

324
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,920
and we think that coordination and

325
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,519
interoperability questions will continue

326
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,639
to arise

327
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,440
so

328
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
the

329
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,040
first reply on the mailing list when we

330
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
proposed our draft

331
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,639
which a considerable number of people

332
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,480
replied indicating their support for end

333
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,920
agreement with

334
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
said that our draft was unnecessary

335
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,639
because it was a matter of common sense

336
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,720
that the itf will fix things that need

337
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,160
fixing even if they're specific to ipv4

338
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,959
but

339
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,639
that

340
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,199
it will only make serious fixes

341
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,920
so i found that to be a bit ill-defined

342
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,760
a bit non-specific

343
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,120
although it was certainly something that

344
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,639
a number of people

345
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,120
indicated their agreement to

346
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,360
we've found a lot of opposition to ipv4

347
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,480
work

348
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
but no clear policy that we can or can't

349
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,160
do it

350
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,399
so i would ask somewhat rhetorically but

351
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
also somewhat concretely and somewhat

352
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,000
practically can we clarify

353
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,680
what common sense and what's serious

354
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,120
mean

355
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,920
and i would note that the other proposal

356
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,360
that we talked about last time the

357
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,399
unicast 240 slash 4

358
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,760
is already

359
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,519
the existing behavior of billions of

360
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,360
devices

361
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
and it's

362
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,040
plausible but it's actually the behavior

363
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,920
of the majority of internet nodes

364
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,639
but it's something where there is far

365
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,639
from universal compatibility

366
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,519
but it's quite a widespread

367
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,120
behavior

368
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
and it seems striking

369
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,360
to say that

370
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,720
this isn't serious

371
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
when it's a behavior for example that's

372
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,760
already implemented in perhaps the

373
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,360
majority of nodes

374
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,839
and billions of devices across the

375
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,240
internet and i guess more concretely

376
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,000
it doesn't seem especially apparent to

377
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,639
me especially well defined in consensus

378
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,720
what this common sense or notion of

379
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,320
seriousness

380
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,120
mean or refer to

381
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,399
so i would hope that we could get and

382
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,160
reach some kind of clear statement of

383
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,639
ietf's relationship to these maintenance

384
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,240
and coordination questions which we

385
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,040
think

386
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,120
have arisen are arising and will

387
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,040
continue to arise

388
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,680
and we query

389
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,519
whether an alternate consensus may be

390
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,800
found

391
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
given the lack of consensus for the

392
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,360
declaring ipv4 historic position that

393
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,320
was noted when that proposal was made

394
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,519
and

395
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,920
looks like that's about it

396
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,079
um and yeah we'll take questions or

397
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,839
comments and

398
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,800
thank you for your attention

399
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,320
thanks that

400
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,399
some people still uh say that they they

401
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,519
get uh

402
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,920
too much uh noise from your from from

403
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,399
your mic we hear you super well but a

404
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,800
little loud so yeah i think it thank you

405
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,639
very much i'll move it further back

406
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,519
sorry about that no no thanks so first

407
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,759
online is eric

408
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,680
thank you sir for the presentation

409
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,399
speaking with my ad here

410
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,720
just to avoid any confusion by people

411
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,959
listening to the youtube video this is

412
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,519
an individual contribution

413
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,480
till now

414
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
and does not represent any ietf

415
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,079
consensus

416
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,320
now

417
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,920
i still wonder

418
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,800
whether the itf can commit to something

419
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,759
forever right we need to get it ended

420
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,079
and finally i would love to get a

421
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,680
clarification

422
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,759
question out of you

423
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,920
you say rpv for fix

424
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,240
do you mean fixing the protocol or

425
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,199
fixing the addressing or what

426
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,079
thank you in advance

427
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,559
thanks

428
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,559
yeah so i don't know about the end date

429
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,359
question i think that's a great question

430
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,839
i think that

431
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,520
um kind of conspicuously to me as

432
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,799
someone who's been

433
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,280
interested in ipv6 and the ipv6

434
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,720
transition for

435
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,480
a long time

436
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,919
i don't think that there was

437
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,960
um really ever a

438
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,799
transition strategy that had such a

439
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,559
thing as an end date people famously

440
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,880
have said well there is no flag day

441
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,640
right um

442
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,559
this transition appears to be in

443
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,120
practice an indefinite thing

444
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,559
i don't

445
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,039
mean to suggest that ietf should commit

446
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,120
itself to a position that the ipv6

447
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
transition

448
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,679
is

449
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
permanent or never complete

450
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,200
but i do think that what we observe

451
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,520
is that the ipv6 transition does appear

452
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,200
from the present moment from the present

453
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,919
perspective to be

454
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,600
something that's very much incomplete

455
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
and that very much has no projected end

456
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,400
date

457
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,240
and that very much is anticipated to

458
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,320
last for the immediately foreseeable

459
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,360
future

460
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,960
and so i think it's worthwhile to

461
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,440
acknowledge that i would be happy to see

462
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,080
proposals that

463
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,919
try to formulate that or try to address

464
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,520
that

465
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,320
um

466
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
i'm trying to recall your other oh your

467
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,600
other question about where the fixes lie

468
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,559
for our particular proposal

469
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,160
we're proposing

470
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,039
fixes that in the immediate term ought

471
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,840
to be performed by

472
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,280
implementers and ought to be present in

473
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,600
ipv6 implementations uh pardon me in

474
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,360
ipv4 implementations

475
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,480
right so we've been

476
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,640
proposing and testing and looking at

477
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,840
behavior typically of devices typically

478
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
of operating systems typically of

479
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,919
operating system kernels that implement

480
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,360
ipv4

481
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,400
and they have commonly

482
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,120
in compliance with historic

483
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,720
not historic status but

484
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,600
older existing and still current

485
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,480
rfcs have treated

486
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,440
certain addresses as inherently invalid

487
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,520
under one might say under the protocol

488
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,640
itself

489
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,960
that these addresses must not be used

490
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,320
and so when these addresses are

491
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,000
encountered certain implementations will

492
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,240
actively discard packets

493
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
so i would regard that as a protocol fix

494
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,679
i understand that for everything except

495
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,280
for the lowest address

496
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,880
there are certainly policy questions

497
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
that are lingering about for example

498
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
allocation policy

499
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,080
we've heard from

500
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
several organizations that are using or

501
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,160
wish to use

502
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,760
reserved address space as rfc 1918 style

503
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,280
private address space

504
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,919
and our proposals have been agnostic and

505
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,440
silent on

506
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,919
that kind of question

507
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,159
clearly that is a possible use that

508
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,480
could be formalized that could continue

509
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,640
unofficially in practice

510
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,400
that could be the subject of an official

511
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,159
designation

512
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,600
so all of the addressing policy

513
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,440
questions and all of the

514
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
other policy questions

515
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,679
our drafts have attempted to leave for

516
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,200
another day and really focus on

517
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
implementation behavior

518
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,480
and say

519
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,400
you may have something in your kernel

520
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,159
that inspects a packet

521
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,720
that inspects an address that says

522
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,760
according to current rfcs i am expected

523
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,919
to drop this packet because this address

524
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,880
is invalid according to the protocol

525
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,799
and that's what we want to see changed

526
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,760
in the

527
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,679
present moment in order to preserve

528
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,400
maximum options for the future

529
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,840
thank you very much for this very

530
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,600
detailed question

531
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,280
i think we share a point that v6

532
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,640
deployment should have been done for a

533
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,960
long time it's not the case even if it's

534
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,760
growing point taken now as an individual

535
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,039
contributor i would be very reluctant

536
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,360
to use the remaining

537
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,159
for addresses that could be reserved for

538
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,760
anything we can do

539
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,159
just to gain one year

540
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,760
or two year

541
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,200
anyway no no need to reply on this

542
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,000
um

543
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
i mean i do i would like to reply on

544
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,159
that because i appreciate the concern

545
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,480
and

546
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,960
um i gave a presentation about this at

547
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,480
nanog

548
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
and i had occasion to

549
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,360
forward a question about exhaustion to

550
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,039
someone who actively works in the

551
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,559
secondary market

552
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,600
for

553
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,280
ipv4 addresses and asked if we were able

554
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,360
to use some kind of auction or

555
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,760
market-based allocation mechanism

556
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
rather than the rir's

557
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,520
non-market-based historic allocation

558
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,799
mechanism

559
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,960
in allocating a pool of addresses like

560
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
this for global unicast how long would

561
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,480
they last and his off-the-cuff

562
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,919
speculation was eight years

563
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,159
so i just wanted to put that out there

564
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,840
in terms of people's concerns because i

565
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
understand that the demand has been

566
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,360
quite voracious and that the exhaustion

567
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,919
has happened quite rapidly anyway i see

568
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,200
there are two other questions and

569
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,039
limited time so

570
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,360
i'd love to get the other questions

571
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,559
hey seth it's tom hill from bt um

572
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,159
i i think

573
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,679
it's sort of kidding ourselves a little

574
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,280
bit to equivocate between

575
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,440
fixes that are

576
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
affecting

577
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,200
you know millions of people across the

578
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,280
world or fixes that benefit a few people

579
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,880
um

580
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,400
we have a lot of parallels of this in

581
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
the software engineering world we have a

582
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,720
lot of parallels for this in cars we

583
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,919
there are huge um

584
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,520
there are swathes of people in the world

585
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,320
who

586
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,280
are quite happy with windows server 2003

587
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,039
which microsoft has long since abandoned

588
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,360
microsoft might one day release a fix

589
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,039
for the firewall for example something

590
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,640
critical something that genuinely

591
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,080
affects all of those servers that are

592
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,919
still out there they might actually do

593
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,600
that they could still do that but

594
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,320
they're not going to back port usb 3.2

595
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,080
support into it

596
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,960
and so you have to think how many people

597
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,799
is this going to help

598
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,120
in terms of these fixes some things

599
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,400
genuinely

600
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,640
we should you know we should care if

601
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,480
ipv4 is broken

602
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,919
properly broken

603
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,000
we should genuinely care about that we

604
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,159
should not care that some people have

605
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,679
elected to write a usb 3.2 driver for

606
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,760
their ipv4 stack it's it's not

607
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,240
necessarily going to help as many people

608
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,320
as you hope

609
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,200
and

610
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,840
ultimately all of this effort

611
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,919
does detract from

612
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,559
rolling out ipv6

613
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,400
but that's a couple of questions in a

614
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
statement but in particular i think we

615
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,320
really need to be very honest with

616
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,000
ourselves about the effort going into

617
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,960
this and what it's for

618
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,799
so i appreciate the distinction that you

619
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,559
draw that there are different kinds of

620
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,279
fixes and that there's different scope

621
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,559
in the benefit

622
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,960
of different fixes

623
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,320
and that may go to arguing that

624
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,600
some of the examples that we've given of

625
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,240
other ongoing ipv4 maintenance may not

626
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,080
be viewed as exactly analogous to our

627
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
proposals

628
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,320
um

629
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,360
and

630
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,880
without having

631
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,080
um

632
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,760
analyzed all the details under that

633
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,200
rubric i can say that seems to be

634
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,570
um

635
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,880
[Music]

636
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
a possible point of argument

637
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,400
um i guess i would say

638
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
it seems like some of the other fixes

639
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,440
have also been fairly specific or fairly

640
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,960
limited in

641
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,720
what they would do

642
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,799
where

643
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,520
some of our fixes have the potential

644
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,000
to alleviate scarcity problems for

645
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,360
a fairly significant number of

646
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,760
organizations admittedly with

647
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,400
potentially some

648
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,640
appreciable delay

649
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,880
but so i guess i would say i would

650
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,840
um

651
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,440
take the point conceptually that there

652
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
are many different kinds of fixes and

653
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
that they may be analyzed differently

654
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,760
and say i also think that our

655
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,840
proposed fixes have a lot of potential

656
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,440
down the road to benefit a lot of people

657
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,000
in a lot of organizations

658
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,640
hey uh jen linkova

659
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
two comments first year i'd like to

660
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,880
second to what been said in my

661
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,559
understanding when we're talking about a

662
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,640
product being in maintenance mode it

663
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,279
means we're fixing bugs

664
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,520
serious bugs like security issues but

665
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,080
we're not developing anything new in the

666
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,559
product and focusing on whatever product

667
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,960
is active now so i think it's what we

668
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,080
should be doing with ipv4 so i have no

669
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,360
objections to before being in

670
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,200
maintenance mode but it doesn't mean

671
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,440
we're going to develop new stuff

672
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,640
and secondly i'm a bit confused

673
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
about

674
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,640
a few slides in your presentation so you

675
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,840
propose

676
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,000
if some work did not

677
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,320
get enough consensus and not enough

678
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
interest do you think that getting

679
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,360
higher level statement about doing more

680
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,080
work in ipv4 would help i was under

681
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,600
impression that you bring in some work

682
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
to atf if there are people who want to

683
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,120
do this and there is consensus you can

684
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,840
do it even if you don't have

685
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,159
a large statement about that stuff so

686
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,559
i'm like not sure what you're trying to

687
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,000
achieve by

688
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,360
having consensus on ipv4 maintenance

689
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,480
thanks um

690
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,039
yeah i think we were trying in large

691
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,039
part to respond to

692
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,039
the tenor and the focus of concerns that

693
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,279
people had and that people expressed on

694
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,159
the mailing list and

695
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,679
also at the

696
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,960
prior meeting

697
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,559
where

698
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,240
in our perception and our understanding

699
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
a lot of people didn't say

700
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,440
so much

701
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,960
oh this won't work well or this is

702
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,200
infeasible or

703
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,520
this is not beneficial

704
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,480
as such but they said it's ipv4

705
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,120
they said ipv4 is obsolete or ipv4 is

706
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,000
done or ipv4 is over or things of that

707
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,279
nature and that was a

708
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,840
predominant rationale for people

709
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
proposing not to work on this or not to

710
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
do this work and so

711
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,440
i think that's a lot of what we were

712
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,600
proposing here to address with consensus

713
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,840
okay

714
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,159
okay thank you very much

715
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,159
we're going to move now to the next

716
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,080
presentation

717
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,840
thank you

718
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,640
thanks

719
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,559
set

720
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,799
thanks

721
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,440
so i'm going to pass you the control

722
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,480
fret so that you can move oops

723
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,600
i love those lights give me one second

724
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,480
are you hearing me okay juan carlos

725
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,440
uh i can i hope people online can also

726
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,480
hear you

727
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,279
well

728
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,200
so i'm gonna try once again to pass you

729
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,760
the control

730
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,159
and you should be able to move the

731
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,480
slides from your side

732
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,240
okay thank you

733
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,120
so this uh presentation is on a new um

734
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,120
construct known as ip parcels

735
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,080
let's see

736
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,399
this is the uh pointer to the

737
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,039
data tracker document the first version

738
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,480
of the document was published in

739
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,559
december 2021

740
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,799
it's closely related to the arrow omni

741
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,880
and dtn proposals where you see the data

742
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,120
tracker entries for those

743
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,440
uh the current draft is the dash zero

744
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,360
nine which was published february 10

745
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,880
2022

746
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,440
and this presentation is a narrative of

747
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,720
the dash zero nine

748
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,559
so um

749
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,440
ip packets both ipv version 4 and

750
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,399
version 6 contain data that becomes the

751
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,679
re-transmission unit in case of loss

752
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,159
upper layer protocols like quick ltp and

753
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,279
tcp

754
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,200
exchange segments

755
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,679
and they include a single segment per ip

756
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,120
packet

757
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,840
what iparcels permits is for a single

758
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,159
packet to carry multiple upper layer

759
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,760
protocol segments

760
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,159
a packet of packets if you will

761
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,440
but the segment is still the

762
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,240
retransmission and loss unit

763
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,000
the goal is to support larger packets

764
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,840
for better performance

765
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,679
to support flexible packaging and

766
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,080
repackaging for more efficient handling

767
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,919
and to encourage larger maximum

768
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,200
transmission units in the internet

769
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,000
so let me give an analogy

770
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,240
when a consumer orders 50 small items

771
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,559
from a major online retailer for example

772
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,559
you wanted to buy 50 keychains to give

773
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,279
out as employee appreciation gifts

774
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,360
the retailer does not ship the order in

775
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,679
50 small separate boxes

776
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,360
instead they put as many of the small

777
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,440
boxes as possible into one or a few

778
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,640
larger boxes or parcels and then place

779
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,240
the parcels on a semi truck or an

780
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,440
airplane

781
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,120
uh the parcels arrive at a regional

782
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,480
distribution center where they may be

783
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,720
further redistributed into smaller

784
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,919
parcels they get delivered to the

785
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,120
consumer

786
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,200
but most often the consumer will only

787
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
find one or a few parcels at his

788
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,320
doorstep and not 50 individual boxes

789
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,159
this greatly reduces the handling

790
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,840
overhead for both the retailer and the

791
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,399
consumer

792
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,440
so a

793
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,480
is formed when an upper layer protocol

794
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,039
identified by the five tuples source ip

795
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,360
destination ip source port destination

796
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,960
port and protocol

797
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,520
produces a buffer with up to 64 upper

798
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,840
layer protocol

799
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,360
segments all segments except the final

800
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,600
must be equal length they can be up to

801
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,279
65 64 k octets minus headers

802
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,399
the final segment may be smaller

803
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,000
the upper layer protocol delivers the

804
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,320
buffer and the non-final segment size to

805
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,840
the iplayer

806
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,080
then the ip layer forms a parcel by

807
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,799
pending a jumbo payload option

808
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,559
and there we have our friend the jumbo

809
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,039
payload option

810
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,880
so ip parcels are based on the

811
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,919
jumbograms construct uh they include a

812
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,840
jumbo payload option but they have a

813
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,799
non-zero value in the payload length

814
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,279
field whereas true jumbos use the value

815
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,840
0 in that payload length field

816
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,519
the payload length gives the length of

817
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,679
the first segment only

818
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,519
the jumbo payload length gives the

819
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,480
length of the entire parcel

820
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,279
so we have ip parcel support for both v6

821
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,559
and v4

822
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,960
so to to do that we've defined the jumbo

823
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,240
payload option for ipv4

824
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,200
the maximum ip parcel size is the 64

825
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,600
segments times the maximum 64k per

826
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,559
segment

827
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,320
slightly under four megabytes is the

828
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,640
largest parcel and here on the right you

829
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,480
see a diagram showing the construct of a

830
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
parcel where we have an ip header

831
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,679
and k segments uh i'm sorry uh j

832
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,039
segments

833
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,158
um all all within the same ip packet

834
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,960
some related work um a concept known as

835
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,039
generic segment and receive offload is

836
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,600
implemented in some os and nics linux

837
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,360
implements it for example

838
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,519
uh the upper layer protocol can supply

839
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,279
multiple segments in a single system

840
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,320
call

841
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,600
there was a study with the quick

842
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,960
protocol that showed significant

843
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,799
performance increases using gso and gro

844
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,159
another study with the look lighter

845
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,399
transmission protocol showed moderate

846
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,159
increases for small to medium-sized

847
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,039
segments with using gso gro

848
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,279
but significant increases for large

849
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,159
single segments even if ip fragmentation

850
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,480
reassembly is needed

851
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,120
another study known as big tcps

852
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,039
considered end system internal

853
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,720
implications of jumbograms for better

854
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,080
performance

855
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,120
so what ipparcels is really proposing is

856
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,279
a combination of the results of these

857
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,840
studies which is the gso gro style

858
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,279
segmentation

859
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,279
plus ip fragmentation

860
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,039
with ip jumbograms for network

861
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,760
transmissions

862
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,720
so there's several different parcel

863
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,640
types a null parcel

864
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,399
is just an ip header with a jumbo

865
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,559
payload option and no next header in the

866
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,080
next header field

867
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,840
and it's essentially a singleton with a

868
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,399
segment length l of zero

869
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,120
then a singleton parcel is an ip header

870
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,360
with jumbo payload option and a single

871
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,399
upper layer protocol segment of length l

872
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,120
then a multi-segment parcel is an ip

873
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,000
header with jumbo payload option uh

874
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,679
j minus one upper layer protocol

875
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,919
segments of length l and the final upper

876
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,080
upper layer protocol segment of length k

877
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,000
which must be less than or equal to l

878
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,519
uh transmission of ip parcels

879
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,720
ip parcels traverse parcel capable links

880
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,279
that have sufficient mtu the same as an

881
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,119
ip packet would do

882
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,199
but parcel capable links are not yet

883
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,719
widely deployed in heterogeneous

884
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,159
internetworks

885
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,719
but an adaptation layer can forward

886
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,199
parcels in an overlay

887
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,440
the omni adaptation layer in particular

888
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,480
uses encapsulation and fragmentation

889
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,560
but the omni adaptation layer breaks

890
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
parcels into smaller subparcels if

891
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,719
necessary since the largest they can

892
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,480
undergo ip fragmentation is 64k octets

893
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,079
so there's a first pass in the

894
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,599
adaptation layer which partial

895
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,440
fragmentation occurs

896
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,280
these are loosely reassembled with

897
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,199
opportunistic merging

898
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,280
and a second pass in which ip

899
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
fragmentation is applied to individual

900
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,520
sub-parcels and here we need strict

901
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,199
reassembly with fragment re-transmission

902
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,119
if necessary

903
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,440
so the goal is to forward the fewest and

904
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,760
largest ip parcels possible over the

905
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,320
network to the final destination

906
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,240
minimize segment reordering due to par

907
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,000
re-parceling if possible but this is not

908
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,160
a critical consideration

909
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,800
uh leverage ip fragmentation reassembly

910
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,880
for greater performance

911
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,040
and the lost unit becomes a single

912
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,839
segment instead of the entire ip parcel

913
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,640
so how do we find out if a path can

914
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,880
handle ip parcels

915
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
we want to qualify the head of the

916
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,800
source to destination forward path as

917
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,040
parcel capable so it can support

918
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,280
incremental deployment of parcel capable

919
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,640
links

920
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,960
so a partial probe from the source can

921
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,720
test consecutive hops up to the

922
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,160
destination

923
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,000
itself or to a router that has a

924
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,480
non-partial capable next hop

925
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,400
and for this we use the hop

926
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,920
option gets processed at each hop

927
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,160
the parcel reply comes from either the

928
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,079
final destination or the router that

929
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,680
informs the source the head of the

930
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,359
forward parcel

931
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,760
path parcel is capable

932
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,000
and this parcel reply is placed in a

933
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,920
destination option so that it's only

934
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,640
processed at the source

935
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,560
so after of the parcel path

936
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,000
qualification

937
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,760
parcels from the source can traverse

938
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,599
partially capable paths the same as

939
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,079
ordinary iop packets up to either the

940
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,480
ends destination or or the router that

941
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,359
terminates the partial capable path

942
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,359
and then routers that terminate particle

943
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,760
capable paths open the parcels and

944
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,680
forward individual ip packets to the

945
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,040
destination

946
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,320
so in other words we want to drive

947
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,800
parcels forward and as far as forward as

948
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,240
possible into the forward path from the

949
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,359
source to the destination

950
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,320
now in terms of integrity

951
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,960
link layer checks like crc32 can miss

952
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,720
errors in packets that are larger than

953
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,560
about 9k bytes

954
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,839
but i t parcels are often much larger

955
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,359
but fortunately

956
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,839
ip parcels include a separate integrity

957
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,680
check for each upper layer protocol

958
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,040
segment so if there's many of them

959
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,560
there's many integrity checks in the

960
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,760
parcel

961
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
so the parcels improve integrity in

962
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
comparison to the same size jumbograms

963
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,000
would provide because the jumbos only

964
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,760
include a single single upper layer

965
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,599
protocol segment

966
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,560
an integrity check

967
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,000
so the next steps are that we want to we

968
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,599
see that i p parcels increase the

969
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,119
efficiency and performance for end

970
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,400
systems

971
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,560
iparcels provide a path forward for

972
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,880
larger mtus in the internet

973
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,119
iparcel spec is in advanced stages of

974
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,800
development here it is

975
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
the point of the data tracker

976
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,960
and i want to ask now if we can adopt ip

977
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,400
parcels as a working group item

978
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,119
okay thank you very much for that

979
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,839
presentation

980
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
so we have uh

981
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,440
no one right now asking questions

982
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,680
to respond to your question about

983
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,920
accepting it as a working group item i

984
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,040
guess we would need to see some

985
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,200
discussion and and some support on the

986
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,640
list

987
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,440
so

988
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,000
uh

989
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,359
we do have you have a question

990
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,599
lars yeah hey fred this is eggert um so

991
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,640
i have a question i might have missed

992
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,480
this but can you say a bit more on the

993
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,320
first bullet how does this increase

994
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,839
efficiency and performance especially

995
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,599
for the end systems because i don't see

996
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,760
it

997
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,240
so we we have two studies that show that

998
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,839
by sending

999
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,240
multiple segments in a single system

1000
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,359
call it reduces the number of interrupts

1001
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,320
and it reduces the uh overhead of

1002
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,440
packaging

1003
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
the uh the parcel

1004
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,280
and for transmission across networks

1005
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,880
that have larger mtus larger packets uh

1006
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,640
increase fewer interrupts and more

1007
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,920
efficiently i don't care about i'm a

1008
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,960
transfer later i don't care about the

1009
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,920
network

1010
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,440
but so we already do this on the end

1011
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,960
systems just fine right with tcp

1012
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,200
offloading and other as you mentioned

1013
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,720
so so

1014
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,480
is there additional efficiency to be

1015
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,839
gained by this over what we're already

1016
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,720
doing and where is it coming from

1017
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,920
it's this is this is based on uh the the

1018
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,200
gso jro and tso

1019
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,119
but kind of all deficiencies we have

1020
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,320
already

1021
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,000
right so these are not new efficiencies

1022
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,200
with this proposal these are

1023
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,280
efficiencies that we already

1024
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,000
have now

1025
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,400
this this proposal was based yes on

1026
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,640
those concepts but it's allowing the

1027
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,359
parcels to travel over network paths

1028
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,240
and

1029
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
some network paths go ahead

1030
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,359
so

1031
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,040
so basically there's no additional

1032
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,480
efficiencies

1033
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,640
over what we already have with gso

1034
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,520
for the end systems

1035
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,960
yeah again the the the hosts

1036
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,000
uh the end systems get to see the same

1037
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,839
efficiencies that they get with

1038
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,400
gsojro and tso

1039
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,599
tcp segment offload

1040
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,440
thank you luigi

1041
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,040
um so luigi uh i had a similar question

1042
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,319
on the performance idea uh i mean in

1043
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,560
slide nine if i remember correctly you

1044
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,440
say we have a bunch of links that

1045
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,079
support ip parcel they may go through

1046
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,119
links that do not support ip parcels so

1047
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,119
basically you have

1048
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,440
operation going on inside the network so

1049
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
at least at the beginning of the

1050
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,760
deployment you will have a performance

1051
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,480
hit because you have to

1052
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,280
uh

1053
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,960
man

1054
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,560
change a little bit the way you you

1055
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,280
aggregate or disaggregate fragment or uh

1056
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,359
uh reassembly the packets right

1057
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,000
if i understood the question correctly

1058
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,119
the

1059
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,560
uh ability to know when to use parcels

1060
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,359
is a not a performance

1061
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,280
intensive operation when you send these

1062
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,880
things called parcel probes which i'll

1063
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,040
put the thing back up again what you

1064
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,720
would normally do is you start sending

1065
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,880
regular ip packets and then send a

1066
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,520
parcel path qualification probe if the

1067
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,200
probe succeeds then you can begin

1068
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,119
sending ip parcels

1069
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,800
so there's not any kind of a performance

1070
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,359
hit for

1071
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,359
starting to use parcels when it's not

1072
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,720
possible to use them for example

1073
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,640
we have time for the continuous question

1074
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,200
so if i could understand correctly

1075
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,440
what happens if only links in the middle

1076
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,319
do support ip parcel but not the endos

1077
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,760
all the links at the end of the you will

1078
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,480
not see the ddip parcel part because the

1079
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,720
path doesn't support is that correct

1080
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,319
it's my answer right in that case you're

1081
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,440
still sending regular ip packets

1082
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,160
okay thank you

1083
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,839
okay

1084
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,359
okay thank you very much fred

1085
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,839
so next is uh luigi do you want me to

1086
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,599
share slides and pass you the

1087
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,839
or you

1088
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:05,359
wanna okay let's try

1089
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,520
okay

1090
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,359
okay

1091
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,960
again i'm luigi

1092
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,599
i'm actually going to present tools to

1093
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,720
just

1094
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,359
an update on two drafts about internet

1095
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,359
addressing we have out there two

1096
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,880
documents the problem statement and the

1097
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,880
gap analysis

1098
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,240
um

1099
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,800
a little bit of telenovelas in the sense

1100
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,920
that what did happens is one one two uh

1101
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,760
we had a side meeting at that point and

1102
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,359
dirk reported

1103
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,720
in this very uh working group so

1104
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,640
based on the side meeting we formulated

1105
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,599
three

1106
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,000
three questions that you asked to the

1107
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,560
mailing list so what exact features do

1108
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,640
we want from the internet where how is

1109
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,560
the features innovation happening and

1110
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,599
what is in address in an address anyway

1111
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,400
um

1112
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,040
actually was good it was good because uh

1113
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,440
we had we started with

1114
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,200
three threads

1115
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
and the discussion spilled all over the

1116
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,760
way actually ip parcels if i remember

1117
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,119
correctly is a spinoff on discussion

1118
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,480
started on the mtu issue on about the

1119
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,920
the first question

1120
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,359
so

1121
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,720
for each and every

1122
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,280
thread what we did is try to summarize

1123
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
the discussion in an email in order to

1124
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,480
check if our understanding was okay

1125
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,160
and we'll show you that in the next

1126
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,680
three slide

1127
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,640
and

1128
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,720
actually even after the summarization

1129
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,760
that we we did when we we thought

1130
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,240
the discussion was more or less over

1131
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,440
uh actually discussion actually went on

1132
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,640
which is good

1133
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,880
um we tried to incorporate everything uh

1134
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
this included some private email

1135
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,119
exchange in order to

1136
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,760
be sure that we captured correctly what

1137
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,359
some people said

1138
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,079
on the email okay so

1139
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,200
and actually we had three new quarters

1140
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,040
on the document laurent

1141
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,839
uh abraham chen and dino farinacci

1142
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,480
but actually there is a contribution of

1143
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,240
a lot of people there

1144
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,359
okay

1145
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,560
so

1146
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,720
first question what exact features do we

1147
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
want from the internet the the summary

1148
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,839
of the discussion one was a a list

1149
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,880
of features

1150
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,160
i just put the keywords but actually

1151
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,880
this resulted in

1152
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,040
a in a new section section 3 in the

1153
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,440
problem statement and each and every

1154
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,920
point here has been developed in a

1155
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,720
consistent way with

1156
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,119
a good paragraph i would say so

1157
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,640
very very good input that we received

1158
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,800
second one was where and how is the

1159
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,680
futures innovation happening so

1160
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,960
the summary of that discussion is that

1161
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,040
not surprisingly a certain way we have

1162
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,839
two dimensions one is the horizontal

1163
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,119
dimension so it's age versus core okay

1164
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,680
the other is the vertical dimensions

1165
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,000
is about which layer of the protocol

1166
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,839
stack so and obviously this is not just

1167
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,800
one of all the other it happens in a

1168
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
hybrid way i would say

1169
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,079
um

1170
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,079
then there were points about how much

1171
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,720
unique and globally rootable an address

1172
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,800
should be this is somehow linked

1173
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,480
to the

1174
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,480
discussions that we see around about

1175
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,200
internet consolidation or centralization

1176
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
depends which terminology you like to

1177
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,240
use

1178
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,839
there was a discussion about address

1179
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,960
privacy um this actually privacy came up

1180
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,760
in all of the three questions in a way

1181
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,680
or another okay

1182
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,480
it seems to be very important and i do

1183
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,160
agree absolutely

1184
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,400
so and um this has evolved mainly in a

1185
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,200
new section five in in the

1186
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,078
gap analysis

1187
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,079
um

1188
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,280
the third question what is an address

1189
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,319
anyway

1190
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,200
so this specific question went beyond

1191
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,160
any expectations that we had uh went

1192
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,520
beyond the the just submission cut-off

1193
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,400
date okay the discussion went on for a

1194
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,520
long time

1195
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,680
even recently there were some some

1196
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,920
follow-up emails on that

1197
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,800
went beyond the entire mailing list

1198
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,119
mostly in the architectural discussion

1199
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,000
okay

1200
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,359
the points reason is a lot about the how

1201
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,119
ephemeral is an address and what kind of

1202
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,560
semantic in a certain way

1203
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,800
it transports because you can see an

1204
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,680
address like a opaque instruction

1205
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,319
that you look up in a table and then you

1206
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,880
whatever the table tells you to do with

1207
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,119
it okay and then you have a certain kind

1208
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,680
of mappings which

1209
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,119
is could be one-to-one there's a

1210
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,280
classical unicast or something more

1211
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,640
revolved

1212
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,280
and this has also brought a lot of

1213
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,760
changes in section 5 on the problem

1214
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,839
statement document and again

1215
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,560
a little bit here a little bit there

1216
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,839
everything is on the data tracker okay

1217
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,160
so i will go quickly through the main

1218
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,280
changes i apologize for the title that i

1219
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,800
messed up somehow didn't know this

1220
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,560
there are two sections in the problem

1221
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,480
statement

1222
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,760
2.7

1223
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,640
is

1224
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,520
about communication protecting privacy

1225
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,839
is a work in progress to be honest the

1226
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,680
plan is because

1227
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,920
the privacy issues has been raised

1228
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,280
several times in all the questions

1229
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,960
we will try to to fetch input from the

1230
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,559
prg research group so the privacy

1231
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,319
enhancement and assessment research

1232
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,319
group i think it's the right community

1233
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,079
to ask for

1234
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,319
and then there is this desired network

1235
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,839
features that is

1236
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,079
more or less the the list that i showed

1237
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,240
you before again we

1238
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,000
with all the text that comes along in

1239
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,680
order to describe what are those

1240
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,800
features

1241
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,240
and um

1242
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,640
other important changes are in section

1243
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,800
four we have a new part of about

1244
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,640
hampering privacy

1245
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,520
and

1246
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,920
in the problem statement section itself

1247
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,240
we added some improved input from the

1248
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,480
discussion that took place actually in

1249
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,319
the architectural discussion mailing

1250
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,920
list

1251
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,319
about the question what is an address

1252
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,400
anyway

1253
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,160
on the gap analysis document the main

1254
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,680
changes is um section five is a new one

1255
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,839
we call it a system view on addresses

1256
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,440
it's where we discuss about this

1257
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,760
two-dimensional

1258
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,880
space where the innovation takes place

1259
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,760
okay and we we try to

1260
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,920
describe

1261
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,760
what are the different implications and

1262
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,680
how it happens okay

1263
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,119
and then there are

1264
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,400
a bunch of

1265
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,200
other important changes that we we have

1266
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,640
in in

1267
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,119
several sections about the

1268
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,400
extension in the length of the addresses

1269
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,960
or we added new examples about chic yeah

1270
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,319
is ip

1271
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,520
or

1272
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,000
what if we have addresses that are

1273
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,880
actually

1274
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,079
longer than 128 bits okay

1275
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,000
and a discussion about semantic

1276
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,880
extension and some improved conclusion

1277
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,240
now

1278
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,960
as for the status of these two documents

1279
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,079
now

1280
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,079
i give you an app i gave you just an

1281
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,800
update on the content the content

1282
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,640
of the documents is for the problem

1283
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,079
statement

1284
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,480
to provide an example and scenarios

1285
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,240
where the the existing internet

1286
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,839
addressing is

1287
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,559
is a potential entrance okay and then

1288
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,480
there is a gap analysis

1289
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,920
what is this happening what has been

1290
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,200
done in order

1291
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,880
to improve in a certain way they're

1292
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,040
addressing and in a certain way this

1293
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,640
represents the fact that

1294
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,400
there are solutions trying to fill in a

1295
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,359
gap

1296
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,000
that's the content but the real purpose

1297
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,160
that we we said since the beginning was

1298
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,119
to

1299
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,119
bring the community to discuss

1300
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,480
addressing

1301
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,440
okay

1302
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,720
and

1303
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,960
certainly we had a difficult start

1304
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,000
okay covet 19 didn't help at all i would

1305
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,960
say

1306
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,000
um

1307
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,720
but uh finally we we

1308
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,880
we we made it in the sense that there

1309
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,559
was a lot of discussion

1310
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,760
and

1311
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,400
we tried to to to gather

1312
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,079
all the different uh facets that we

1313
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,520
uh we saw

1314
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,839
um we just left out

1315
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,200
at this stage

1316
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,079
any

1317
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,280
any discussion or text that was going

1318
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,880
too much into

1319
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,800
solution space because it's not the

1320
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,800
scope of these two documents okay

1321
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,720
which brings me

1322
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,079
to the last slide to be honest so

1323
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,559
i think these two documents document a

1324
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,960
community effort all the co-authors that

1325
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,920
are on board they do agree that uh

1326
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,240
they're

1327
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,440
bringing value in the sense that uh uh

1328
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,319
documents something or concerns that

1329
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,119
that are there okay so all their crowd

1330
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,440
was think that this world

1331
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,960
thinking about working group adoption

1332
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,079
here in the interior okay

1333
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,599
looking long term

1334
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,400
but we don't discuss this now is was

1335
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,440
thinking

1336
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,760
that what should we do next

1337
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,480
and this goes again back to community

1338
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,280
discussion on what should we do

1339
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,280
once we we agree

1340
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,520
that these issues

1341
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,920
are there some of us believe they are

1342
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,440
very

1343
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,040
important issues

1344
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,119
depending on the issue something is not

1345
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,480
that important

1346
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,720
it depends on the viewpoint but

1347
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,119
yeah this is long term about the

1348
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,400
solution and that's it from my side

1349
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,559
any question welcome

1350
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:55,760
thanks a lot

1351
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,359
luigi

1352
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:58,400
so

1353
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
are there any questions

1354
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,280
from the room or online

1355
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,240
so

1356
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,479
okay

1357
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,000
so i guess we need to have some more

1358
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,839
discussion on the list before answering

1359
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,119
your questions about even even

1360
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,839
but yes

1361
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,440
please continue listing this this

1362
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,400
document thank you very much

1363
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,680
all right

1364
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,400
so is uh lenny under

1365
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,200
in the room yet

1366
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,400
remote

1367
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,200
lenny is still on his way

1368
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,119
lenny's on his way so so we're going to

1369
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,040
move to lynn

1370
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,000
yes i'm here

1371
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,240
okay

1372
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,400
give me one second i'm going to share

1373
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,559
the slides

1374
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,200
and then i'm going to give you

1375
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,200
control

1376
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,920
you should be able to move the slides

1377
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,800
now lynn

1378
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,280
lin

1379
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
can you hear us

1380
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,400
yes

1381
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,920
i can hear you

1382
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,760
okay you you

1383
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,800
you're up you can move the slides now

1384
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,240
uh

1385
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,559
but i cannot move how how can i move

1386
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,520
this

1387
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,319
oh yeah yeah use it

1388
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,760
uh

1389
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,200
okay got it

1390
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,280
all right

1391
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,119
hello everyone uh this is zelin and

1392
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,400
uh um

1393
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,440
presentation is about satellite network

1394
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,920
and problem and solutions from uh

1395
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,040
airstrip perspective

1396
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,079
and

1397
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,760
this is uh

1398
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,520
this works start from

1399
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,040
probably uh i ietf 111

1400
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,920
we published the problem statements

1401
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,079
and later on we

1402
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,079
published some uh

1403
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:21,680
draft draft

1404
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,760
about solution so far we have a three

1405
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,240
draft about solution but it is still not

1406
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,520
complete

1407
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,880
and

1408
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,200
last night here if i try to get the

1409
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,920
opportunity in in the area but i didn't

1410
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,880
so this time i'm happy to present our

1411
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,839
work for this regard

1412
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,839
and

1413
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,240
this is our objective uh

1414
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,559
what we want to do is that we want to

1415
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,440
explore the open solution for a large

1416
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,880
scale lu constellation

1417
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,680
which is for internet access and ntn

1418
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,160
integration

1419
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,400
even we have so many

1420
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,880
legacy

1421
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,440
satellite technologies here but we are

1422
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,480
dealing with

1423
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,680
the latest development in the in this

1424
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,280
industry which is

1425
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,160
like

1426
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,960
starlink over 10 000

1427
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,240
satellites

1428
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,760
and the services for the global

1429
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,440
internet access

1430
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,480
and also we want to try to

1431
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,400
work on the expectation from 3gpp which

1432
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,240
is called the

1433
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,599
ngren

1434
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,839
which will integrate the area

1435
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:38,240
constellation with 5g and the internet

1436
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,200
at this moment what we plan to do is

1437
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,359
that we want to provide the basic ip

1438
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,640
connectivity

1439
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,359
or basic for satellite network

1440
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,359
and all drafts so far are only

1441
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,359
informational experiment

1442
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,839
and right now we expect more feedback

1443
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,079
from different wg

1444
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,119
and

1445
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,599
of course right now uh people may feel

1446
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,000
confusing to understand whole solution

1447
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,359
because

1448
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,760
there's no dedicated working group in

1449
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,559
itf so i can only present different

1450
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,960
pieces of solution to different working

1451
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,000
group who is interested

1452
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,160
of course we will not do anything which

1453
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,599
relate to 3gpp for example they uh for

1454
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,359
integration partly they have a lot of

1455
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:22,559
protocol

1456
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:23,280
and

1457
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,920
defined already in cgpt but we don't not

1458
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,770
touch it

1459
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,160
[Music]

1460
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,079
so what is the problem problem is that

1461
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,400
uh right now uh we we think the

1462
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,200
satellite lu satellite constellation is

1463
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,359
very specific uh

1464
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,119
uh network which

1465
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,000
our current uh igp bgp

1466
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,240
mobility protocol

1467
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,880
cannot handle it efficiently

1468
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,599
and if you want to see more explanation

1469
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:50,559
uh

1470
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,760
you can go to this slide deck we have a

1471
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,960
kind of a presentation before to our

1472
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,559
collaborator uh university story

1473
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,079
to discuss the uh problems uh for the

1474
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,640
satellite and the problems for 3gpp and

1475
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,000
iitf

1476
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,599
and in this slide i also try to answer

1477
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,440
questions which

1478
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,440
arises before

1479
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,480
ietf meeting and also in the uh youtube

1480
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,359
sets

1481
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,880
mayor alias

1482
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,520
most of questions are not very technical

1483
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,640
details about my our proposal is about

1484
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,880
why we need to do this and why the

1485
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,599
current satellite networking company

1486
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,559
didn't raise any question to ietf those

1487
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,839
kind of things

1488
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,440
also we

1489
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,240
give some introduction about the ng-run

1490
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,359
requirement for cellular network from

1491
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,960
there you can see that

1492
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,720
ip is a

1493
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,640
kind of instructor for the for the whole

1494
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,599
architecture so we have to provide ip

1495
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,319
connectivity to to them

1496
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,920
uh last week provides some simulations

1497
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,920
to uh mobility

1498
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,880
uh links and passes you can see that

1499
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,480
from there how frequent of this

1500
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,880
state changes so

1501
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,799
it's easier to understand why the

1502
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,359
current id technology which are

1503
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,520
assumed very steady cannot handle

1504
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,760
through a fast moving

1505
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,760
network

1506
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,480
uh here i just give more uh discussion

1507
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,720
about the semantic address because this

1508
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,119
is probably the interest of this working

1509
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:31,920
group

1510
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,040
and the semantic address is it's a we

1511
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,359
designed dedicated for satellite network

1512
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,680
because li network is very special it's

1513
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,200
not like the

1514
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,880
network on ground

1515
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,680
satellite network is very organized even

1516
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,839
they are moving very fast but they are

1517
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,400
moving on the same speed if they're on

1518
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,520
the same attitude so we propose to use

1519
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,720
the

1520
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,920
three index to represent each satellite

1521
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,880
uh dynamically because those index never

1522
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,640
change even satellite position is

1523
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,599
changing

1524
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,319
so we have a share index which will uh

1525
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,280
describe the uh which share or which

1526
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,880
layer of uh

1527
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,079
satellite the this will be determined

1528
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,880
only by the altitude and the inclination

1529
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,359
angle so if

1530
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,359
every satellite has the same altitude

1531
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,000
and incontination angle those satellites

1532
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,319
are belong to the same shift the skill

1533
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,920
index will be set

1534
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,079
also the orbit plane index

1535
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,760
is that the uh

1536
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,079
from the picture you can see the uh the

1537
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,280
lines uh connect different uh green dots

1538
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,559
their orbits

1539
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:42,960
and the object plane is that the uh

1540
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,680
some satellites were moving on the same

1541
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,640
orbit

1542
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,119
the those index will be same and the

1543
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,520
satellite index is that

1544
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,240
for each satellite on the same orbit uh

1545
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,040
which

1546
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,839
position or a relative index in that

1547
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:59,040
object

1548
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,680
so from this uh three index we can uh

1549
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,880
uniquely identify each satellite in a

1550
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,720
satellite concentration

1551
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,359
and for the this uh uh

1552
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,880
semantic address uh pro uh draft we

1553
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,760
for the let's update we add co-author

1554
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,680
and also add one section which is a

1555
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,599
32-bit semantic address

1556
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,760
and why we add this uh section is

1557
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,359
because the uh

1558
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,920
satellite network is related to the

1559
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,680
closed so if we use ipv6 it's pretty

1560
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,319
much overhead if we can use a much

1561
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,040
shorter address it will be a

1562
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,680
big 7 and the satellite

1563
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,160
network the network resource is not like

1564
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,880
the resource on ground their memory

1565
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,440
their chip is very expensive so the

1566
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,000
saving on the overhead is very available

1567
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,880
to customers

1568
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,760
[Music]

1569
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,799
and this one will talk about uh

1570
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,480
why we uh

1571
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,720
what is a basic

1572
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,839
routing algorithm we will a proposal to

1573
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,900
satellite network and

1574
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,440
[Music]

1575
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,599
why we need to do this because of

1576
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,079
satellite that will be very special

1577
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,799
current igp bgp we are facing a lot of

1578
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:15,920
challenges

1579
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,880
and

1580
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,000
why that

1581
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,319
because we have a very fast link

1582
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,400
flipping every five minutes

1583
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,040
and link matrix keep changing because

1584
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,839
the distance keeps changing and some

1585
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:31,040
unsteady link also keep flipping

1586
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,920
and also the uh probably the link

1587
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,400
interruption at the polar area

1588
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,359
or above will cause huge igp flooding

1589
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,839
message which will cause the storm of

1590
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:42,720
the

1591
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,319
protocol message

1592
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,400
and the service time will be

1593
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,119
dramatically reduced so here is a review

1594
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,240
of how the topology looks like we have

1595
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,760
50 percent

1596
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,920
uh satellites moving to one direction

1597
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,920
and another 50 percent

1598
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,799
satellite moving to different directions

1599
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,119
every satellite moving very fast more

1600
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,720
than uh seven

1601
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,640
kilometers per second

1602
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,000
and also every device on ground we are

1603
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,480
moving with the earth's rotation which

1604
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,200
is also very fast more than even faster

1605
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,039
than sound speed

1606
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,240
and the link metrics keep changing and

1607
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,720
the ground state station to cell life

1608
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,520
link also keep flipping instead

1609
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,839
in addition to the link matrix change

1610
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,240
so what is the problem using igp of

1611
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,400
course igp can be used here but the

1612
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,559
problem is that because the the link

1613
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,680
states this changes so frequently the

1614
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,079
service time will be

1615
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,000
dramatically reduced

1616
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,240
because the number of the

1617
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,920
unsteady link is huge we have some paper

1618
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,400
and an analyze that says that less than

1619
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,760
20 is a is a kind of usability

1620
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,319
which is not tolerable to the service

1621
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,240
provider

1622
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,960
and then well when we try to find the

1623
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,359
solution for the satellite routing we

1624
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:06,960
have to think about the special

1625
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,760
characteristics for satellite network so

1626
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,000
first of all the uh the cellular network

1627
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,039
is not like the regular network it's uh

1628
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,839
it is kind of a carrier network of uh

1629
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,760
which means the the the satellite

1630
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,760
network uh of course with the

1631
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,599
intercellular link it

1632
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,359
will only only do the transport work

1633
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,170
and

1634
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,760
[Music]

1635
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,440
satellite network is very organized so

1636
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,520
as i said it's multi-layer of grid

1637
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,400
network even interleaved and moving to

1638
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,760
different direction

1639
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,160
also there are limited number of into

1640
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,000
satellite link because those links are

1641
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,039
very expensive probably six or a little

1642
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,880
bit more than six will be enough for

1643
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,960
swiss a a satellite in 3d space

1644
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,760
so we can use a

1645
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,440
self-explanatory semantic address to

1646
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,480
identify

1647
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,799
each satellite as i said for that draft

1648
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:05,520
and importantly that satellite position

1649
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,119
is predictable

1650
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,440
when time is changing

1651
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,720
because every satellite orbit element

1652
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,760
parameters are known so what we can

1653
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,520
predict we can predict the satellite

1654
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,640
adjacency and the link metrics all those

1655
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,720
information we don't need to measurement

1656
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,160
and the

1657
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,680
protocol message to advertise

1658
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,079
so here is our um

1659
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,400
hybrid solution we think we need to use

1660
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,640
some hybrid technology to get the final

1661
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,280
solution and this is the principle first

1662
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,960
is that we have to

1663
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,079
use the computation power in in this

1664
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:43,119
space

1665
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,160
issues

1666
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,760
and we have to

1667
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,039
do the computation for dynamic topology

1668
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,559
for dynamic mapping metrics also predict

1669
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,200
which ground station took satellite link

1670
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,400
could be

1671
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,640
used

1672
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,880
then we have to borrow the igp for

1673
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,440
example right now we borrow igp for the

1674
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,559
net net body and the state detection

1675
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,960
and probably we have one uh draft for

1676
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,720
this this draft is just for isolate the

1677
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,160
the those link which is very uh unstable

1678
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,160
and probably more draft will come for

1679
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,039
the different other purpose

1680
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,760
also we uh we will utilize the spatial

1681
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,359
characteristics

1682
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,280
like i said the semantic address can be

1683
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,039
used

1684
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,839
and lastly that we come out to this uh

1685
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,799
instructive routing a draft for the

1686
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,400
routing purpose

1687
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,559
so the interactive writing is very

1688
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,720
simple it's like the semantic writing

1689
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,760
but we because we use a semantic address

1690
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,359
we can correctly uh compress the uh

1691
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:51,640
header we don't need to put the

1692
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,960
segments id there we just put tell the

1693
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,520
satellite where to fold the packet which

1694
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,559
direction

1695
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,200
and until which satellite this is

1696
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,359
example

1697
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,559
and

1698
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:05,839
lastly

1699
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,760
i showed the the some

1700
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,480
packet format because we use a new

1701
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,839
rocking type so we need to uh

1702
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,720
insert as a instruction list into the

1703
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,400
packet and

1704
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,480
the packet can be

1705
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,720
folded at each satellite if if a

1706
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,599
satellite network engine can understand

1707
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,799
what is the interaction

1708
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,400
so here is the uh summary of the

1709
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,240
interactive routing and what is the

1710
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,520
advantages

1711
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,559
and

1712
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,799
i probably don't have time to go through

1713
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:40,000
all this

1714
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,670
and

1715
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:42,000
[Music]

1716
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,240
i think

1717
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,039
questions

1718
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,039
okay thank you very much we have one

1719
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:54,400
person on the queue gory

1720
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,480
hi gary fergus thanks for the talk it's

1721
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,160
really interesting to see the internals

1722
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,480
of one of these leon networks

1723
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,839
and my question is probably

1724
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,039
um

1725
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,039
which operators are calling for this

1726
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:11,119
work to be done here i mean this is a

1727
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,760
interoperability question do we need a

1728
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,880
standard

1729
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,880
within satellite systems to do this or

1730
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,319
is this just an interior routing

1731
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,160
protocol which we just need to view at

1732
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,319
the edges so which operators are you

1733
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,160
talking to or which

1734
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,839
manufacturers are asking for this

1735
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:29,520
work a very good question

1736
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,839
i think i have some answer in the

1737
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,920
problem statement workshop

1738
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,079
why itf need to do this

1739
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,240
from our point of view uh first of all

1740
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,880
the uh consolidation is

1741
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,440
right now the the operation mode is that

1742
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,839
such as starting every company providing

1743
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,000
its own solutions right but the problem

1744
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:48,880
is that

1745
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,680
uh

1746
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,920
the orbit resource and the spectrum

1747
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,920
resource is very limited

1748
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,839
we think in the future the satellite

1749
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:56,880
network

1750
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,920
should be

1751
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,119
shared by different service providers

1752
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,920
for example the leo orbit

1753
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,640
they only can hold about 60 000

1754
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,920
satellites

1755
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,440
right now starlink

1756
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,359
consumed the 40 000

1757
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,200
and the china constellation consumed

1758
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,200
more than 12 000

1759
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,880
so we don't have too many orbits

1760
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,439
resource right now so in the future i i

1761
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:20,560
believe

1762
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,120
the due to the resource limitation

1763
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,238
on the orbit and also spectrum and also

1764
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:29,439
some countries and anti-trust regulation

1765
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,120
the satellite network could be

1766
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,560
infrastructure

1767
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,839
this is also the point from the 3gpp

1768
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:39,040
that's the uh satellite network is just

1769
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,520
a kind of like backfill network it

1770
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,198
should be

1771
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,000
provided the uh service by different

1772
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,319
service provider so from this point

1773
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:49,839
where we think that

1774
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,279
uh ipso uh the the top of the open

1775
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,679
solution to the cellular satellite

1776
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,000
network also probably in the future the

1777
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,479
difference owner of the satellite could

1778
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:03,600
have some interpret interoperability

1779
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,759
issue there

1780
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,359
can i just follow up with the question

1781
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,920
you mentioned starlink did starlink

1782
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,198
actually want to do an ip operable

1783
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:14,799
solution or does styling currently

1784
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,359
operate a proprietary solution

1785
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,359
i think they are

1786
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,040
they're only right now the starting

1787
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,439
doesn't need any l2 and l3 solution

1788
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:24,880
because they are doing the relay

1789
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,560
technology but they are testing the rsl

1790
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,198
from this year however i don't expect

1791
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:33,600
reveal to the public solution because

1792
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,839
there's some monopoly yeah that's the

1793
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,679
current their business model is private

1794
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,198
thanks for the presentation it was very

1795
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:42,319
interesting

1796
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,719
thank you

1797
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,920
okay

1798
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,640
thank you very much so now we'll move to

1799
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,960
lenny's presentation

1800
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,120
oh lenny

1801
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,159
okay i don't see the slide yet oh there

1802
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:18,400
it is

1803
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,920
so i'm going to give you control

1804
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,560
all right thank you

1805
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,360
so today i'm going to talk about a draft

1806
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,120
on

1807
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,760
considerations for

1808
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,320
blocking uh regional internet access um

1809
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,480
uh one important note

1810
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,840
uh the the content and ideas

1811
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,000
uh expressed in this

1812
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,280
are solely the

1813
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,239
views of the authors uh and it does not

1814
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,400
reflect um as individuals and it doesn't

1815
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,199
affect the views or positions of our of

1816
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,120
any of our affiliations

1817
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,560
and for those uh it kind of goes without

1818
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,080
saying but for those who are less

1819
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,080
familiar with ietf processes who might

1820
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,760
be um

1821
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,280
watching um as perhaps newcomers this is

1822
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,280
an individual contribution and does not

1823
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,960
reflect uh or represent itf consensus

1824
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,199
and this is eric here

1825
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,640
and if you just

1826
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,679
allow me to emphasize what you just said

1827
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:29,280
for the people listening to this on

1828
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,520
youtube later i am the internet era

1829
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,840
director and thank you so much for

1830
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,760
clearly spelling out that's an

1831
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,840
individual contribution and indeed

1832
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,840
that's not representative

1833
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,840
sorry for repeating what you just said

1834
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,080
thank you

1835
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:48,159
not at all thank you eric for clarifying

1836
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,360
all right now let's get to the fun um

1837
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,120
so

1838
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,320
just a little bit of background and

1839
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,159
motivation um

1840
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,640
and the purpose behind this draft um in

1841
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,280
light of recent geopolitical events uh

1842
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,280
there have been discussions in various

1843
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,280
circles technically non-technically

1844
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,040
political uh on the concept of

1845
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,679
blocking internet connectivity for

1846
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,080
a country or a region

1847
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,760
um

1848
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,360
what we wanted to do

1849
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,880
is describe

1850
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,040
what that might look like um kind of

1851
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,800
some well-known approaches for blocking

1852
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,520
connectivity that service providers use

1853
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,560
um fairly frequently and commonly

1854
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,880
um and then describe the implications of

1855
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,280
either of each of these approaches um

1856
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,040
the positive negative the advantages

1857
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,800
disadvantages

1858
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,400
um

1859
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,640
the intended audience for this document

1860
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,280
uh is policymakers

1861
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,600
and kind of the general public at large

1862
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,520
pretty much all the people who aren't in

1863
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,440
this room

1864
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,920
but who are interested in the topic

1865
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,560
um and would like to know

1866
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,440
what would this look like um we do not

1867
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,159
take any position uh about whether this

1868
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,840
is a good idea or a bad idea but what

1869
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,960
we're trying to

1870
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,600
provide is some background information

1871
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,000
on what this might look like

1872
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,040
so that those who do have uh opinions on

1873
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,159
the matter

1874
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:12,880
and

1875
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,040
can can can have informed opinion um

1876
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,040
good policy depends on good unbiased

1877
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,880
sober information

1878
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,320
and that's what we're trying to do here

1879
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,840
um just kind of describe what is

1880
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,880
technically possible how it would work

1881
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,600
uh whether or not it might be um

1882
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,120
effective

1883
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,120
and try to

1884
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,960
anticipate some of the

1885
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,360
potential intended and unintended

1886
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,599
consequences of such a policy

1887
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,920
um what this document is not uh we are

1888
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,239
not again advocating for or against any

1889
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,560
particular policy or position we're not

1890
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,159
saying that this is a good idea or a bad

1891
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:49,040
idea

1892
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,640
we're just reporting the news and and

1893
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,600
let others decide uh on the basis of

1894
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,239
some of the information we're providing

1895
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,480
not providing any political opinion or

1896
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,440
analysis on the ethics of blocking

1897
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,960
connectivity

1898
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,960
um to the internet

1899
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,320
also we would like obviously

1900
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,000
this document has been inspired by

1901
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,280
recent events

1902
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,800
but um

1903
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,000
it's probably not going to be the last

1904
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,120
time uh or the last conflict that might

1905
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,719
inc uh inspire um discussions so we'd

1906
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,800
like this to be generic enough to be

1907
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,840
applicable

1908
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,199
uh

1909
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:29,760
beyond um just a single event uh and be

1910
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,520
uh maybe valuable for the future um

1911
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,000
and and perhaps you know it it could be

1912
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,800
useful for

1913
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,360
you know before events take place um it

1914
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,800
could be helpful in

1915
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,000
uh maybe guiding actions

1916
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,120
um

1917
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,920
it's also not a guide uh for blocking

1918
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,159
against security threats um you know

1919
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,400
there's some and i'll talk about uh some

1920
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,480
of related work that covers um if if if

1921
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,199
a network or a region is attacking you

1922
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,800
know blocking that region that's that's

1923
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,120
a completely different issue um this is

1924
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,520
not protection from a region but more so

1925
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,040
about sanction

1926
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,800
um kind of the the or uh the the

1927
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,840
internet connectivity equivalent of you

1928
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,080
know economic sanctions um think of it

1929
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,679
as connectivity sanctions so that's kind

1930
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,239
of the use case we've envisioned here

1931
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,600
uh we're also

1932
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,040
you know not producing a how-to guide on

1933
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,520
weaponizing or you know

1934
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,640
uh

1935
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,440
magical industry secrets on um on

1936
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,800
killing uh access um everything we've

1937
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,560
limited uh

1938
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,800
all of the approaches to

1939
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,320
well-known

1940
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,600
ideas and approaches that operators

1941
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,199
use frequently

1942
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:48,239
uh

1943
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,880
to to legitimately

1944
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,880
filter and block internet access

1945
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,760
so we don't believe that we are giving

1946
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,960
away

1947
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,159
or planting seeds or

1948
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:05,040
adding any um you know that there's

1949
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,480
nothing groundbreaking here in terms of

1950
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,840
what we're doing these are all well

1951
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,440
well-known well-understood techniques

1952
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,880
that have been documented um elsewhere

1953
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,080
we believe

1954
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:14,880
um

1955
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,440
it's also we we didn't go into the area

1956
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,080
of malicious attacks um either

1957
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,000
physically um you know bombing in

1958
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,560
infrastructure or um you know through

1959
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,719
cyber attacks or things like you know

1960
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,679
dns cash poisoning um i think those are

1961
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,600
interesting topics and probably worth

1962
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,159
another you know document but um it's

1963
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,640
it's kind of outside uh it seemed too

1964
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,320
broad of an area and it's kind of

1965
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,840
outside the um

1966
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,159
area of expertise to the authors so

1967
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:43,520
we kept that out of scope for this

1968
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,920
document

1969
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,120
all right um with that out of the way uh

1970
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,199
the actual meat of the document

1971
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,760
um blocking techniques so we kind of

1972
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,360
start from the physical layer uh and

1973
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,760
work our way up um so disconnecting

1974
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,719
cables

1975
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:01,840
um you know how effective would that be

1976
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,320
uh what that would look like um deep

1977
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,080
here and then moving on to the routing

1978
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,000
layer in the control plane things like

1979
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,280
d-peering

1980
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,960
um

1981
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,360
and next is wrap filtering

1982
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,600
both prefix based and

1983
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,640
autonomous system based

1984
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,840
next we we cover

1985
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,480
packet layer at the data plane

1986
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,040
discussing things like goip access

1987
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,880
control lists

1988
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,520
and finally we talk about dns um things

1989
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,159
like you know undelegating top level

1990
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:37,360
domains or other relevant domains um

1991
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,199
also the idea of blocking resolution

1992
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,120
requests um either coming from name

1993
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,880
servers or end hosts

1994
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,199
in a given region

1995
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:46,880
so as you can see there's there's

1996
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,040
nothing like i said uh

1997
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,480
groundbreaking um no no industry secrets

1998
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,679
here these are all pretty common

1999
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,440
techniques um

2000
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,600
for the most part maybe not undelegating

2001
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,640
top level domains but

2002
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,719
but these are in use today by uh

2003
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,239
operators for legitimate purposes

2004
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:07,120
um

2005
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,440
the next area we talk about is you know

2006
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,840
efficacy with this work um what are some

2007
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,960
of the

2008
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,960
concerns uh

2009
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,920
consequences intended and unintended

2010
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,040
um

2011
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,719
and the first thing is you know

2012
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,480
from the perspective of a policy maker

2013
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,239
who might be advocating a position like

2014
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,480
blocking um

2015
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,400
this approach may end up being

2016
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,320
counterproductive

2017
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,600
so

2018
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,840
a policy maker might actually want

2019
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,600
messages to be able to get into or out

2020
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,880
of a region

2021
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,120
or they might want certain parties say

2022
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,440
you know oppositional groups for example

2023
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,880
to be able to communicate freely uh and

2024
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,600
and and coordinate activities

2025
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,880
um

2026
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,640
it may indeed

2027
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,480
actually empower a targeted regime

2028
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,480
that is being targeted for sanctions by

2029
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,040
allowing that regime to consolidate its

2030
01:18:59,040 --> 01:18:59,920
power

2031
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:00,880
by

2032
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,640
you know not allowing

2033
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,960
uh any other messaging

2034
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,960
independent messaging

2035
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,000
from getting into or out of a region so

2036
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,320
um this should be kept in mind

2037
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,960
uh by a policy maker

2038
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,600
if considering this approach

2039
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,440
um the other thing that's you know

2040
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:23,199
obvious is that a network is amoral it

2041
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,440
does not you know uh

2042
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,360
it does not discriminate between good

2043
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,440
bits and bad bits it just transmits bits

2044
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,920
whether those bits comprise

2045
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,840
uh desirable or undesirable

2046
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,920
information

2047
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,280
also

2048
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,280
autonomous system numbers and prefixes

2049
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,080
are not allocated uh according to

2050
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,000
geopolitical boundaries

2051
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,840
they are loosely

2052
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,120
allocated based on region

2053
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,760
and even that uh has kind of porous

2054
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,239
borders

2055
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,640
you can you know for example you can

2056
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,920
fairly easily see all the prefixes or

2057
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,520
autonomous systems

2058
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,400
that are allocated to

2059
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,040
companies that are based in a country

2060
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,120
however over time those

2061
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,960
uh let's say entities rather than

2062
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,159
companies those entities um may be

2063
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,719
say acquired by other

2064
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:20,320
you know multinational

2065
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,679
entities and those routes and autonomous

2066
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,159
systems could be advertised

2067
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:30,000
from other places in different regions

2068
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,639
there's the cloud um in any event it's

2069
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,080
it's it's uh

2070
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,360
[Music]

2071
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,560
um

2072
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,080
there are porous borders and it's

2073
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,320
difficult uh to

2074
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,679
neatly say

2075
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:42,560
um

2076
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,600
this region or this country um

2077
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,920
only has the routes coming in

2078
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,440
you know

2079
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,639
from

2080
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,800
uh entities uh that are based in that

2081
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,639
region

2082
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:55,840
also they can be multi-homed in

2083
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,120
different regions

2084
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,800
um

2085
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,719
there is registry information but that

2086
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,960
is uh notoriously inaccurate um

2087
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,199
uh and finally the decentralized nature

2088
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,440
of the internet makes it pretty much in

2089
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,560
you know

2090
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,560
um it's pretty much impossible to

2091
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,639
completely block a region this is kind

2092
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,520
of a feature not a bug this is by design

2093
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,239
um the the internet was kind of intended

2094
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:21,840
to act like this

2095
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,880
um

2096
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,199
that said uh you can put a pretty good

2097
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:28,880
dent in connectivity and throughput um

2098
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,480
at certain there there are certain chunk

2099
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,840
points where you could pretty

2100
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,520
significantly um restrict access um and

2101
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,920
and do some some harm if one wanted to

2102
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,639
actually do that

2103
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,040
um there has been some prior art in this

2104
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,480
area um rfc 7754

2105
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,920
um

2106
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,800
talks about uh blocking and filtering um

2107
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,440
but this document is more focused at a

2108
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,960
kind of higher level

2109
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,360
application level transport host level

2110
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,360
rather than network infrastructure

2111
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,280
also the purpose of this dock is mostly

2112
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,199
is more focused on things like security

2113
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:06,480
and objectionability and business

2114
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,639
arrangement and less so um sanction

2115
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,320
so there's there's a good bit of

2116
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,920
difference here that that said there are

2117
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,679
some overlapping themes

2118
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,840
uh on things like efficacy and the

2119
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,040
importance of

2120
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,800
uh specificity

2121
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,120
um when it comes to uh filtering and

2122
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,520
blocking

2123
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,920
there's a draft in the p-e-a-r-g

2124
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,159
working group on censorship

2125
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,480
and again this is more

2126
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,800
focused on censorship by regimes within

2127
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,480
their borders

2128
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,960
rather than say blocking all traffic

2129
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,840
coming out of that uh that

2130
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,880
that region as say you know

2131
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,960
sanctioned because of the activities of

2132
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,800
a regime um so it's more of a

2133
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,960
directionality difference um but again

2134
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,560
there's there are you know there is a

2135
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,120
little bit of overlap um there is the

2136
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,880
the the mess the mention of

2137
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,560
considerations for

2138
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,159
service dis uh disconnection

2139
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:03,600
um

2140
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,920
in terms of next steps um i would love

2141
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:06,719
to

2142
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:08,639
ask this working group um is this

2143
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:10,880
document useful uh is it interesting is

2144
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,320
this something that

2145
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,920
folks in this working group would like

2146
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,040
to

2147
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,040
work on

2148
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,800
are there

2149
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,719
other blocking techniques that we didn't

2150
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,280
include that should be included

2151
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,679
and we are requesting uh adoption by

2152
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:26,960
this working group

2153
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,560
um

2154
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,560
another open question is bcp versus

2155
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,000
informational

2156
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,239
we kind of went back and forth on this

2157
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:36,639
um we don't have really strong opinions

2158
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,040
we'd be uh happy to go with consensus if

2159
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,120
this is adopted

2160
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,120
and we'd love uh review and comments and

2161
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,199
with that i'd be happy to take any

2162
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:47,440
questions

2163
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,199
okay thank you very much lenny we do

2164
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,520
have people on the queue so we start

2165
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,000
with ted

2166
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,639
ted hardy speaking uh thank you very

2167
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:02,320
much for uh your time in putting this

2168
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,719
together as a presentation and i'm

2169
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,080
particularly appreciative of the fact

2170
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,520
that you uh

2171
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,679
clarified that this was an individual

2172
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:11,840
contribution and that you're now asking

2173
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,960
for comments from uh the

2174
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:19,440
um from the group um i i'm about to

2175
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,360
speak about the internet society and

2176
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,880
although i am currently on the board of

2177
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,880
trustees of the internet society

2178
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,400
i want to make it clear that i'm not

2179
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,560
speaking for them the reason i want to

2180
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,480
speak about them is because the

2181
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,679
questions that you're dealing with in

2182
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,120
this document have actually been dealt

2183
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,679
with by the internet society for some

2184
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:36,800
time

2185
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,719
they have been creating impact

2186
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,560
assessments

2187
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,400
there is a generalized framework which

2188
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,280
they have created to describe the

2189
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,639
effects of internet blocking and the

2190
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:48,159
techniques of internet blocking and they

2191
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:50,000
have over time

2192
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,639
gone into the specifics of the internet

2193
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,639
blocking on different territories at

2194
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:55,920
different times

2195
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,120
so

2196
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,880
for example there was one on the sudan

2197
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,280
that was done in 2019 there have been

2198
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,840
three such impact reports on the current

2199
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,000
geopolitical situation

2200
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,480
examining the current um

2201
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,560
efforts to possibly

2202
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,440
um remove uh russia from the internet

2203
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,199
the request by the ukraine government to

2204
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:16,159
icann

2205
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,159
and uh the related

2206
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:21,280
uh impacts of uh uh partition of the

2207
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,320
network

2208
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,480
by these efforts so

2209
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,040
there's there's a whole bunch of work

2210
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,280
that is specifically directed toward

2211
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,800
policymakers

2212
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,760
that's already been done uh by isoc by

2213
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,400
access now by others

2214
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,000
i would suggest

2215
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,840
uh that the authors consider reviewing

2216
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,960
that work

2217
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,639
uh and seeing whether they really see

2218
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,880
any gaps having reviewed this document i

2219
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,000
did not

2220
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,679
uh so i don't think that there are

2221
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:49,600
techniques that you've described here

2222
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,760
that are not in them and i don't think

2223
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,320
that you're addressed to policymakers is

2224
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,960
as effective as those other addresses

2225
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,239
and that the primary reason for that is

2226
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,639
those are attempting to describe both

2227
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,320
the technical activities which are

2228
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,280
happening

2229
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,239
and the impact and it is vitally

2230
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:11,600
important that policy makers twin those

2231
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,239
two concerns at once because they need

2232
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:15,600
to understand

2233
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,480
in the context of a specific

2234
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,880
partition of the network what the impact

2235
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,800
is both on the network and on the people

2236
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,600
who it impacts that's the policy

2237
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,679
question from the point of view of those

2238
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,520
who you believe your intended audience

2239
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,000
are and i don't think it's

2240
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,239
appropriate to try and put these

2241
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,960
documents out without those impact

2242
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,040
statements because the result will be

2243
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,320
policy makers making decisions without

2244
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,719
the full picture and it is desperately

2245
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,320
important that they understand the full

2246
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,960
picture in cases like this

2247
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,360
so i really discourage int area from

2248
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,679
adopting this i really believe the right

2249
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:57,520
thing to do is to contribute to the

2250
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,440
policy work that's going on in other

2251
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,360
forums whether it be the internet

2252
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,800
society or access now or others and make

2253
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,960
sure that your expertise is available to

2254
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,000
them

2255
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,400
trying to do this through here

2256
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,080
is not going to be as effective because

2257
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,320
we can't bring in those other pieces to

2258
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,480
what the policy makers need

2259
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,000
thank you again for your efforts in

2260
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,199
considering these questions

2261
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,840
thanks ted um

2262
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,440
yeah i i think that's that's great

2263
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,880
feedback um

2264
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,719
and there's there's lots of activities

2265
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,280
going on i i think um

2266
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,120
i don't have an answer other than to say

2267
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,280
you know what would be uh i would turn

2268
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,639
this back to the consensus of the

2269
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:40,480
working group as well and see if if

2270
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,880
others share uh that uh those those

2271
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,120
opinions and thoughts um so

2272
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,800
you know if if if we believe that this

2273
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,560
document doesn't really add anything to

2274
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,719
what's already out there then um you

2275
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:54,400
know that's that's that's consensus so

2276
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,560
thank you yeah uh

2277
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,840
jen lincoln just a random network

2278
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,239
engineer i feel like

2279
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,159
let's say you're a doctor

2280
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,080
and you publish a very

2281
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,679
well written very well thought article

2282
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:11,840
about 15 best

2283
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,080
methods to shoot your neighbor in the

2284
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,760
food

2285
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,920
with careful with cost-effective

2286
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,920
analysis and all this stuff so it's

2287
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,920
basically how i feel when i read this

2288
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:29,199
um again we're i i don't think we're

2289
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:31,440
trying to describe uh how to shoot your

2290
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,440
neighbor in the foot as much as if you

2291
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,880
shot your neighbor in the foot this is

2292
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,120
what would happen uh so this is what you

2293
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,480
should think about before shooting your

2294
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,719
neighbor in the foot um that's kind of

2295
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:43,760
um

2296
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,440
hopefully you know that that's why it's

2297
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,000
a considerations document and less a

2298
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,719
how-to guide

2299
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,159
thank you

2300
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:55,480
uh alisa

2301
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,040
thanks um thanks for for the

2302
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,000
presentation um and the disclaimers um

2303
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
so i'm one of the authors of rfc 7754

2304
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,600
and i thought i might share a couple of

2305
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,360
lessons learned from that process

2306
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,280
because it was

2307
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,159
it was not easy and it it shared some of

2308
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,639
the same flavor but obviously a very

2309
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:18,480
different context so

2310
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,000
we started thinking about writing that

2311
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,080
document also triggered by like a

2312
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,960
specific event or activity that was

2313
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,639
occurring which was

2314
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,639
proposals of a couple of

2315
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:31,280
dns filtering

2316
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,960
pieces of legislation in the u.s

2317
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,440
congress they're called sopa and pipa

2318
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,159
so that was the genesis for the document

2319
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,400
and i think it started out maybe in a

2320
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,199
not

2321
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:44,239
dissimilar form from from your document

2322
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:45,120
um

2323
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,360
and then over time we really it took a

2324
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:50,480
long time to to publish um and so and so

2325
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,639
completely missed also the

2326
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:53,760
um

2327
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,280
you know the the event that it was

2328
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,520
trying to impact because by the time we

2329
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,320
got to the publication um

2330
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,480
that those bills had already um died in

2331
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,159
congress um but the time also gave us an

2332
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:07,760
opportunity to provide the document with

2333
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,440
much more structure and so you pointed

2334
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:12,719
out you know the focus on um particular

2335
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,320
aspects like the analytical framework

2336
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,400
that we used um looking at scope and

2337
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,800
granularity and efficacy and security of

2338
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:19,920
each of the different blocking

2339
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,880
techniques um but we started much more

2340
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,960
towards what you have which is you know

2341
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,120
not not so much of a framework

2342
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,360
um but i think that the key difference

2343
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,040
between that document and this one is

2344
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,760
that ultimately it does have a bit of a

2345
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,320
normative valence because it's um

2346
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,639
trying to show which of the techniques

2347
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,320
are consistent with the internet's

2348
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,880
architecture and which ones are not

2349
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,320
and i think in the case of this like

2350
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,920
mass scale blocking that isn't really

2351
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,080
possible right um because if you're

2352
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,520
disconnecting from the network then you

2353
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,600
are inherently not consistent with its

2354
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,760
architecture uh and so i think other

2355
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,960
than in these sort of one-off kind of

2356
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,120
limited deep hearing cases you can't

2357
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,360
really avoid that um with with the

2358
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,520
disconnection or the block you know the

2359
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:05,520
the outright blocking case

2360
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,199
and that makes

2361
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:09,840
the trade-off between any value that you

2362
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,000
get from publishing this document and

2363
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,719
the potential downsides of um you know

2364
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:17,840
implicitly appearing to endorse um any

2365
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,480
of the techniques uh much

2366
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,159
it's just a much different trade-off i

2367
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:25,440
think um which speaks in favor of of not

2368
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,679
advancing this this kind of document and

2369
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:30,800
i don't think you can really avoid

2370
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,960
the you know a political reading or the

2371
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,880
political implications of it even if you

2372
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,400
don't say anything about that in the

2373
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,639
document itself i think it will be read

2374
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:42,639
um as as an endorsement um so

2375
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:45,199
i am you know not supporting of the

2376
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:46,880
document moving forward

2377
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,880
thanks

2378
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,920
yeah

2379
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,080
again if if if someone reads this as an

2380
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,280
endorsement of blocking uh internet

2381
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:01,679
access i'm for a region i'm not sure

2382
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,800
i'm not sure they're reading it uh

2383
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,159
clearly uh or or perhaps we're not being

2384
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:11,040
clear enough um so that's certainly not

2385
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:15,760
the intention implicitly or explicitly

2386
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,400
thank you thank you very

2387
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:24,239
retired backbone engineer

2388
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,639
um

2389
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:28,880
uh

2390
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:32,320
a question that lenny might answer at

2391
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,159
the end

2392
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:34,960
uh

2393
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,320
is

2394
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,280
have you drawn on any

2395
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:42,239
expertise in diplomacy

2396
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,960
to figure out

2397
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,159
how the perception

2398
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,960
and the related side effects of having

2399
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:51,920
such

2400
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,960
a paper

2401
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,440
published

2402
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,840
have to be expected and can be

2403
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,560
controlled

2404
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,080
looking

2405
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:10,000
at just the first few lines of the paper

2406
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,360
i find

2407
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,239
uh i'm quite sure it is a really bad

2408
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:15,440
idea

2409
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:16,880
uh to

2410
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,400
brand

2411
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,360
uh

2412
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:23,440
this thing as a best current practice

2413
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,919
and then

2414
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,560
talk about

2415
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,159
the topic

2416
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:33,440
in the first sentence

2417
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,360
to raise the question whether

2418
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,280
this is

2419
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,280
and how it can be

2420
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,400
a constructive tactic

2421
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,280
just look at the text it's the last two

2422
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,639
cent two words of the first sentence of

2423
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,360
the abstract

2424
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,400
i feel

2425
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,440
that

2426
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,520
whatever technical

2427
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,120
relevant and correct input

2428
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,920
information follows in the paper if you

2429
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,080
begin this way

2430
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,239
you are inviting people

2431
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:12,480
to interpret this

2432
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,840
and

2433
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,320
republish

2434
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:20,159
uh as either an a threat of doing

2435
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,159
something

2436
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:24,320
or the invitation

2437
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,600
to do

2438
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,400
something like this

2439
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,719
um

2440
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:34,719
and well okay if you if you if you if

2441
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,719
you really feed the public discussion

2442
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,719
like this

2443
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,840
uh that's something that can

2444
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,840
hardly be repaired

2445
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:49,520
so

2446
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,600
i would urge

2447
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,320
the authors if they haven't done so so

2448
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,360
far

2449
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,840
to act to really uh

2450
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,760
invoke

2451
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,360
qualified

2452
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,760
diplo diplom diploma

2453
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,520
diplomatic

2454
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,000
expertise to figure out

2455
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,880
what the effects of what they are doing

2456
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,360
can be

2457
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,000
having a german historic historical

2458
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,360
background

2459
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,280
i can tell well okay just the fact

2460
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:21,440
[Music]

2461
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,759
that

2462
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,159
people did know

2463
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,960
that there was v heisenberg group doing

2464
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,280
nuclear research in germany

2465
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,199
during the third reich

2466
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,360
well okay

2467
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,199
uh that

2468
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:41,520
resulted in having the manhattan project

2469
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,400
and

2470
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,199
well okay the

2471
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:47,679
reverberations of that project are still

2472
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:50,080
hitting us today

2473
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,400
thanks

2474
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,520
in terms of the first question on uh did

2475
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,159
we consult diplomatic resources uh we

2476
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:02,960
did not um the authors

2477
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,800
wrote this in their individual

2478
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,280
capacities as

2479
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:11,840
engineers with the intent of providing

2480
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,040
information

2481
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,480
um

2482
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,400
the goal of which would be

2483
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,440
so that the layman um the lay person

2484
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,800
uh could

2485
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,239
find this as helpful information in

2486
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,639
understanding this these issues we

2487
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,440
intended it to be

2488
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,480
sober without opinion one way or the

2489
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,040
other um and we

2490
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,440
tried to take great pains uh to make it

2491
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,239
clear that we were

2492
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,000
not uh

2493
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,520
endorsing uh supporting or advocating

2494
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,520
any position one way or the other

2495
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,119
but just providing

2496
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,320
kind of a

2497
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,239
you know staying in our swimming lanes

2498
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:55,280
as engineers of

2499
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,199
this is what

2500
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,119
some of the things that someone might

2501
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,880
suggest doing

2502
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,639
this is how it would work and this is

2503
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:05,840
what it would might do or might not do

2504
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,159
again as as as informational purposes

2505
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:10,880
for

2506
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,440
um policymakers in the public at large

2507
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,199
who want to understand

2508
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:17,520
uh what these policies might actually

2509
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,719
accomplish

2510
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:21,199
we would welcome if if

2511
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,040
if we didn't do a good enough job

2512
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,199
uh and if there are better ideas for

2513
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:28,880
making that more clear uh in terms of um

2514
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:31,040
you know not advocating a position like

2515
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,800
i said that was our goal

2516
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,840
but if if others have uh better you know

2517
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,000
text suggestions we'd be more than

2518
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,400
welcome to it um

2519
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,440
i see your point on bcp um like i said

2520
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,000
it's it's an open question bcp versus

2521
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,239
informational um we don't have a strong

2522
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:49,600
opinion one way or the other and we'd be

2523
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,679
happy to accept consensus

2524
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:53,600
uh and

2525
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,040
i think there was a final point oh um

2526
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,199
does just merely mentioning this plant

2527
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:03,520
the seeds uh and codify um

2528
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,400
the idea uh

2529
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,880
and make it a legitimate um thing just

2530
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,040
by mentioning it

2531
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,480
you know the only thing i would say is

2532
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,320
that kind of

2533
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:17,119
ignoring a subject uh and not having a

2534
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:19,840
you know not saying anything about um

2535
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,679
speaking a an about an elephant in the

2536
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:23,840
room doesn't make that elephant go away

2537
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,679
um

2538
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:27,040
not sure that's the right metaphor but

2539
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:30,840
um uh

2540
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,639
i i i i'm not sure these these ideas

2541
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,880
would uh just disappear

2542
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,080
or seem to be endorsed um if it was

2543
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:43,679
merely mentioned um you know uh

2544
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:44,800
so

2545
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,480
i think it's up to the you know we'd be

2546
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,760
happy to hear the consensus of the

2547
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,199
working group whether or not the

2548
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:52,080
question is does this um

2549
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:54,159
is this an appropriate thing and is

2550
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:55,840
there interest in

2551
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:59,560
discussing these issues

2552
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,400
tom hi lenny um

2553
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,400
tom hill speaking entirely as an

2554
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:08,320
individual internet contributor

2555
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,159
i suspect it was a necessary evil that

2556
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:13,040
there

2557
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,119
were

2558
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:16,480
there was going to be a technical

2559
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,080
response to what is effectively a

2560
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,400
political question and

2561
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,560
i think you've written

2562
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,000
um

2563
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,199
very well

2564
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:28,960
and and and sean uh shown that you know

2565
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,520
clearly this is

2566
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,840
something that you don't support

2567
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,880
which is good um i i wanted to

2568
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,639
to draw your attention on the basis that

2569
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,119
there is a difference between what you

2570
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:42,639
say and how you say it and how you

2571
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:43,760
publish it

2572
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,000
have you seen any of the internet

2573
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,880
sanctions project

2574
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,199
and the letter i'm not familiar with

2575
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:53,199
no i'm not familiar with that work i

2576
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:54,719
would advise you to to have a look at

2577
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,080
that

2578
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,960
i think in terms of the way in which

2579
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,119
we go about this there will ultimately

2580
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:04,480
need to be a technical answer

2581
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,239
i fear

2582
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:08,639
potentially the raw information just

2583
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,400
throwing it out there

2584
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,639
may not have been the most considered

2585
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,000
approach

2586
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,760
um

2587
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,800
so

2588
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,520
in terms of the questions posed

2589
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,320
in

2590
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,400
bcp versus information all they think is

2591
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,000
moot i don't believe that there should

2592
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,760
be any further work done

2593
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,760
to this draft and i certainly wouldn't

2594
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,600
support adoption

2595
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,440
by any working group

2596
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,080
thank you very much

2597
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,040
thank you

2598
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,000
thanks

2599
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,480
benjamin

2600
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,000
hi

2601
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,280
ben schwartz

2602
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,800
uh

2603
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:45,920
i think

2604
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,520
the

2605
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,679
i you know i appreciate that that you're

2606
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:51,360
looking for an opportunity to do

2607
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,080
something constructive here um

2608
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,199
and

2609
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:56,960
i think that

2610
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,119
uh it needs a little more thought to

2611
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:00,880
figure out what that is

2612
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,560
um you know one

2613
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,920
one possibility that i could imagine

2614
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,960
is

2615
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,119
is uh starting from the other end of the

2616
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:11,520
problem uh

2617
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,440
and and also taking a longer time

2618
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,760
horizon you know i think that just the

2619
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,280
you know since the time that you wrote

2620
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,880
this draft i think

2621
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,880
the the events that inspired it have

2622
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,000
already

2623
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,239
evolved pretty radically i suspect that

2624
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:25,679
the draft would look very different if

2625
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,280
it was written today instead of two

2626
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:28,800
weeks ago

2627
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,000
um

2628
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,960
and so i think that there's uh

2629
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:33,840
there's

2630
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,480
a need to to take a longer time horizon

2631
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,600
and i also

2632
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,840
echoing other comments think that

2633
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,360
uh the sort of attempt at a neutral

2634
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,440
technical presentation here doesn't

2635
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,199
really get to the heart of the matter

2636
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:50,719
because this is not a technical problem

2637
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:52,320
so to

2638
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,840
i think that

2639
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,199
one thing that might be more productive

2640
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:56,800
is to start

2641
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,800
by going to

2642
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,960
um by going to an organization

2643
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,960
that doesn't have to be

2644
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:05,840
uh

2645
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,320
neutral at all on this topic and and can

2646
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,840
actually make some sort of of normative

2647
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,320
statement

2648
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,119
that might be the iab uh or or it might

2649
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:18,480
be another body

2650
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:21,520
but to start there and and then

2651
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,320
potentially revisit this document in

2652
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,800
light of what could serve

2653
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,840
their goals

2654
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:32,880
yeah again we're we're not trying to

2655
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,520
advocate for or against anything what

2656
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,119
we're trying to do is provide technical

2657
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,600
expertise uh

2658
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,270
in

2659
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:43,360
[Music]

2660
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,520
so that those who do

2661
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,119
uh

2662
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,520
form those opinions uh and advocate for

2663
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,199
those policies can

2664
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,719
have an informed

2665
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:53,590
um

2666
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:54,960
[Music]

2667
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,159
uh be better informed as they make

2668
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:02,480
as they um advocate for those policies

2669
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:08,040
thanks um thank you mallory

2670
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,639
hi everyone mallory noodle i'm the

2671
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:15,600
center for democracy and technology um

2672
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,480
yeah i um first want to just say i think

2673
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,639
the discussion has been interesting and

2674
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:23,760
i i welcome that um noting as well that

2675
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,760
you are all presenting tomorrow at the

2676
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:28,400
human rights protocol considerations

2677
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,000
research group meeting which is in the

2678
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,400
first session tomorrow um where i think

2679
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:36,159
it might be interesting to cue up um

2680
01:43:36,159 --> 01:43:38,400
more of these sort of three

2681
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,040
discussions of uh you know the politics

2682
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,639
so i actually welcome that discussion

2683
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:46,080
even if like others i disagree that the

2684
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,080
draft should move forward in its current

2685
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,159
form but i've also previously reached

2686
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,920
out to you as authors because i think

2687
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,520
that um

2688
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,639
the

2689
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:58,000
the effort to try to describe

2690
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,800
problems for the internet which is done

2691
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,480
in the censorship draft that you've

2692
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,920
obviously read and you noted in your

2693
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,320
slides is an important one i mean

2694
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,000
there's a lot of balance that needs to

2695
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,080
be taken into consideration that alyssa

2696
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:13,280
and others have pointed out um and you

2697
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,440
know if that draft which the censorship

2698
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,639
draft is from november 2014 so we're

2699
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:20,400
talking a very long time to be able to

2700
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:23,119
get around to describing these things in

2701
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:24,719
just the right way

2702
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:27,199
with the intention of

2703
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:28,080
um

2704
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,040
helping

2705
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,719
network operators

2706
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:32,719
fix it route around it

2707
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:34,239
like harden the network against

2708
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:35,679
censorship obviously not the other way

2709
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:37,600
around and um

2710
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,679
i think that if there are ways in which

2711
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:42,000
that draft could do that better based on

2712
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,560
um your read of things from ip blocking

2713
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,480
space geo blocking space i think we'd

2714
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,639
welcome text although we're about to put

2715
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:52,000
that draft into another last call

2716
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,760
i think that may be a place where you

2717
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,840
could do a very thorough review and make

2718
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,800
sure that we are actually considering

2719
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,800
the ways in which

2720
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,800
geo-blocking is done especially ip

2721
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:03,920
blocking because i don't know that

2722
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,920
that's as present and prevalent as it

2723
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,560
should be again for the purposes of

2724
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,480
identifying weaknesses in the network

2725
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,400
that could be further hardened against

2726
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,199
um

2727
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,480
these kinds of

2728
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:17,119
censorship uh whether it is

2729
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:20,000
um lawful proportionate or other kinds

2730
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,679
of questions and i would just say that

2731
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:22,800
you know

2732
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,639
and not to lay it on because i think

2733
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:25,840
others have done a good job and you've

2734
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,960
responded but you know the

2735
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,320
you know the iutf's in the business of

2736
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,159
keeping things connected i think that

2737
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,560
even if there were sanctions even if

2738
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,040
there were calls for the intern

2739
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,800
internet connectivity to be included in

2740
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,560
those sanctions which currently in this

2741
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,199
very specific situation it has not been

2742
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:45,280
and has never been in the past if we're

2743
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,520
talking about syria iran iraq

2744
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,440
afghanistan like no

2745
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:50,880
sanctions have included internet

2746
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:54,159
connectivity so far even if there were

2747
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:57,199
we would want the iatf to probably

2748
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:59,119
resist that right in whatever ways it

2749
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,520
can either by explaining that it's you

2750
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:02,960
know not proportionate that that's not

2751
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,480
what they're we're in the business of

2752
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,800
doing if we even take a political stance

2753
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:07,679
i think

2754
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:10,880
um and that's really important so anyway

2755
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,679
those are my thoughts thanks so much um

2756
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:15,280
look forward to speaking with you about

2757
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:18,000
it tomorrow as well

2758
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,920
great thanks mallory uh and just for the

2759
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,280
purpose of uh

2760
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:24,000
transparency we we presented this at

2761
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,159
ipeg on um

2762
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:29,360
on sunday uh and we as as marilyn

2763
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,639
mentioned where um we're going to uh

2764
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:35,199
share this with um

2765
01:46:35,199 --> 01:46:38,560
hrpc tomorrow uh not for the purpose of

2766
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,400
working group shopping um it's it's

2767
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,840
really interior was uh the

2768
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,320
the only work group we we had um

2769
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,360
intended uh to request uh adoption but

2770
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:52,840
more to um share these ideas and

2771
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,920
um uh get more review and feedback

2772
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,360
from a broader

2773
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,559
uh scope of the community

2774
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,800
okay thank you very much i think you you

2775
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,199
got quite a bit of interesting feedback

2776
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:08,560
and uh i would actually encourage you to

2777
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,560
look at the references if ever the the

2778
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,960
audio was not very clear we got a whole

2779
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:15,600
bunch of references uh bodies and

2780
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,360
documents that probably you should

2781
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,440
consider so we'll make sure that

2782
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,679
those are captured uh in the minutes if

2783
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:23,520
ever you missed them

2784
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,639
but i think the feedback was

2785
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:28,080
quite clear that at this moment the

2786
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,760
group doesn't believe this is a document

2787
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,840
that should move forward however it's an

2788
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,360
interesting topic that

2789
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,840
can be discussed either here and or in

2790
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,639
some other forum

2791
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,040
thank you

2792
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:41,920
thanks

2793
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,480
thank you very much

2794
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:49,280
all right

2795
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,760
so we're a bit short in time and we're

2796
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:54,080
we're planning to do uh

2797
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,159
some uh three minutes at the end to to

2798
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:57,760
run a few questions about the interest

2799
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:58,560
on the

2800
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,600
drafts that have called for adoption

2801
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,080
so we're going to call uh tony now to

2802
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,119
present

2803
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:07,040
and if you can

2804
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,560
do it quickly

2805
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,960
it'll be appreciated

2806
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:23,239
uh

2807
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:37,199
all right thank you uh this talk is on

2808
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,840
higher levels of address aggregation

2809
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,400
uh this is something of a footnote on

2810
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:45,199
the discussions that we had insider

2811
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:46,880
30 years ago

2812
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,719
so this is uh very much a footnote

2813
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:52,239
um

2814
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,159
so back when we started talking about

2815
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:56,320
cider we talked about simple aggregation

2816
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,800
and advertising things

2817
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,880
we talked a little bit about aggregating

2818
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,679
entire continents and regions

2819
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:07,440
but um i don't think anything happened

2820
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,440
about that at all

2821
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,600
and i just wanted to revisit that with a

2822
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,960
couple of new ideas

2823
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,599
um one thing that's happened differently

2824
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:19,599
is that we've been leaking a lot more

2825
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:23,040
specifics for traffic engineering

2826
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:25,599
and that's had a lot of bad effects

2827
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:28,000
it's caused a lot of noise in the bgp

2828
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,760
routing table

2829
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,080
if we could do aggregation of these it

2830
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:34,800
would be very helpful in reducing the

2831
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,119
routing table

2832
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:40,320
we also have a new idea that

2833
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,480
basically actually it was old but it

2834
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,719
could not get written down for how to

2835
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:46,800
think about aggregation i wanted to get

2836
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,560
this written down before i forget about

2837
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,080
it or retire

2838
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,800
and we did talk about proxy aggregation

2839
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:53,840
long ago

2840
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:56,000
that got shot down but what happens if

2841
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,639
we did unilateral remote aggregation

2842
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,159
so traditional aggregation we have an

2843
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:06,719
isp he's got a prefix p

2844
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:09,599
he advertises that out of his borders

2845
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:12,880
all was happy in the world

2846
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:17,760
new concept we want to clarify and say

2847
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,239
that the abstraction happens at a

2848
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:22,159
boundary and we want to call that

2849
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:24,320
specific boundary of the isp the

2850
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,960
abstraction naming boundary that's the

2851
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,639
border

2852
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:32,000
thing that we are abstracting

2853
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:37,360
and the next new idea is the concept

2854
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:40,639
called abstraction action boundary

2855
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:43,119
and this is uh 100 percent due to noel

2856
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:45,280
chiappa like to thank him for

2857
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,800
suggesting this

2858
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:49,119
um basically the idea is that we don't

2859
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:51,840
have to aggregate necessarily at the isp

2860
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:52,960
boundary

2861
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,159
we can aggregate one or two or many

2862
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,719
steps past that point

2863
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:00,239
so in this case

2864
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:02,320
the abstraction naming boundary is still

2865
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:05,040
the isp with his prefix p

2866
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,480
he's generating lots more specifics

2867
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,560
they make it somewhere some way into the

2868
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,440
network and then the oval is the

2869
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,080
abstraction action boundary where we now

2870
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:20,599
aggregate and advertise p

2871
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:25,920
what happens if a remote

2872
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,679
as decides to do remote aggregation

2873
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:31,599
they decide they're on that abstraction

2874
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:33,119
action boundary

2875
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:35,599
and they stopped advertising and

2876
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:37,840
propagating more specifics and just

2877
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,360
advertised

2878
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,119
the

2879
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:43,920
abstract the aggregate

2880
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,599
as far as i can tell

2881
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:49,520
this is actually something that works

2882
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:50,880
more specifics we're going to cause

2883
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:54,480
traffic around right around ispb

2884
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:56,639
but b is still providing reachability so

2885
01:51:56,639 --> 01:51:59,760
he's not strictly in violation of

2886
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:02,800
transit requirements

2887
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,719
if b does his aggregation on ingress

2888
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:08,719
he can actually reduce the load on his

2889
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:10,480
routers because he's not carrying more

2890
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,280
specifics internally

2891
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:16,080
if the aggregation happens on egress

2892
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,480
ispb can still do do the traffic

2893
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:20,719
engineering but now he's advertising

2894
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:23,599
less to his neighbors

2895
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:25,679
as far as i know this is could be

2896
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,920
acceptable in some cases

2897
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:30,800
and could we be doing this to improve

2898
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,199
organizational continental or regional

2899
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:35,759
aggregation

2900
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,239
right now regional aggregation is

2901
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:42,880
possible um i take a look

2902
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,960
i want to talk about the ipv6 address

2903
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:47,440
space because that's the most obvious

2904
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,440
we've assigned some nice large prefixes

2905
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,480
to our

2906
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,000
rirs

2907
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,639
things like slash 12s are now common

2908
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:56,719
and these are fine candidates for remote

2909
01:52:56,719 --> 01:52:58,480
aggregation

2910
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,080
if you could do

2911
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:02,400
remote aggregation here you would filter

2912
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,760
out the traffic engineering more

2913
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,360
specifics

2914
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:08,080
you would hide all of the rir specific

2915
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,760
organizations

2916
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,320
and could just reduce the amount of

2917
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:15,199
noise in the routing table

2918
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:17,280
how do we figure out where we should do

2919
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:18,000
this

2920
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
where is the abstraction action boundary

2921
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,239
if we do it too close to the region

2922
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:26,400
we're going to break traffic engineering

2923
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,239
we know that traffic's not going to go

2924
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:30,239
the way we intend

2925
01:53:30,239 --> 01:53:33,199
if we are too far away from the region

2926
01:53:33,199 --> 01:53:36,560
then we know that that's wasteful we're

2927
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,800
having carrying around

2928
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:42,480
longer prefixes more than we need to

2929
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:44,480
so some field input here would be very

2930
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:45,920
interesting

2931
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,760
if both folks could sit and think about

2932
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:50,719
how they would like to do this

2933
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:55,520
uh just as a recollection

2934
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:58,159
this is a map of where our rirs

2935
01:53:58,159 --> 01:53:59,679
currently are

2936
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:02,639
as you can see they are mostly

2937
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,119
aligned with continental boundaries but

2938
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:08,440
not exactly

2939
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,880
if you wanted to aggregate a write

2940
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,280
prefix for example

2941
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:18,159
you might take and

2942
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:20,000
pick this line that i've shown here in

2943
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:20,960
color

2944
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,119
and that might be your

2945
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:25,760
abstraction action boundary

2946
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:28,400
because it's across a bunch of

2947
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:31,199
transnational links and transcontinental

2948
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:32,159
links

2949
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:34,480
where they're presumably fewer links

2950
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:36,800
you would capture the necessary parts

2951
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,960
for traffic engineering and wouldn't

2952
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,320
lose any

2953
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:44,320
significant route optimality

2954
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:46,960
okay

2955
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,040
similarly you could do this on the

2956
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,719
continental basis

2957
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:52,480
and i'm going to pick on jeff houston

2958
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,560
and australia

2959
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,639
and say okay we want to

2960
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:00,080
do some allocations to australia and

2961
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,159
then we could do aggregation

2962
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:03,760
around

2963
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:06,320
australia

2964
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,080
could you could you speed up so that we

2965
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,520
have a little time for the last

2966
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:13,440
presenter thanks i'm almost done

2967
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:16,000
um there are some rpki issues we have to

2968
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,239
talk about

2969
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,280
and

2970
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,960
very much love to hear from people

2971
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:25,760
trying to do this

2972
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:29,679
okay thank you

2973
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:32,400
okay thank you very much uh we have dino

2974
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:35,440
we'll take one question

2975
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:39,760
uh hi this is dino can you hear me okay

2976
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,440
yes yeah yeah

2977
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,080
yeah so um tony when you're talking

2978
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,239
about where the abstraction action

2979
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:47,760
boundaries should be

2980
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,199
um

2981
01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:50,800
you know we've thought about this for a

2982
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,560
long time if it should be done on

2983
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:56,239
ingress versus egress

2984
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,800
and the thing about proxy aggregation as

2985
01:55:58,800 --> 01:55:59,520
you

2986
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,840
as you well know is that when you proxy

2987
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:04,480
aggregate i call it kind of sometimes

2988
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,960
you lie because if you advertise you

2989
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,880
p to somebody

2990
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,480
you're making the assumption that you

2991
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:12,480
can reach everything that's inside of p

2992
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:14,639
everything that's more specific

2993
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:15,679
from it

2994
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:17,040
and if you're carrying the more

2995
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,760
specifics inside then you could actually

2996
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:22,480
drop at that boundary

2997
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,159
versus

2998
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:26,800
aggregating on ingress which means you

2999
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:28,560
believe you can forward already all the

3000
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,520
way to the edges of the sp and then you

3001
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,040
give it to

3002
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:34,800
your neighbors your

3003
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,960
adjacent neighbors and they may not have

3004
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,360
the more specifics and have to drop it

3005
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,440
so it sounds to me logically and more

3006
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:44,000
efficiently that you'd want to

3007
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,159
aggregate on egress

3008
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:48,880
to maybe tail sites

3009
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:52,000
versus transits i'm not sure about that

3010
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,440
but that's just kind of what my hunch

3011
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,280
feels right now

3012
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:56,880
comment um

3013
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:59,520
i would love to discuss this with you in

3014
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,480
the press for time let's take it offline

3015
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:04,159
okay sure

3016
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:09,159
thank you very much to both uh zhongpang

3017
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:21,000
can you hear me

3018
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,679
okay

3019
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:31,040
hello hello everyone

3020
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,639
i'm

3021
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:35,840
from tinymobile and this

3022
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:39,040
is a new draft and it's about a

3023
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,560
service shooting

3024
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,400
in the imac

3025
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:44,560
and next page please

3026
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,960
yeah you should be able to move the page

3027
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,560
okay

3028
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:49,920
oh thank you

3029
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,440
this is about the background

3030
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,679
the mobile operators are deploying this

3031
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:58,000
rmc to private service with lower

3032
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,159
latency to their users

3033
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:00,960
and

3034
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,800
in this mic scenario upf

3035
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,400
working will work as a gateway or the ue

3036
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,520
and

3037
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:12,719
under the tunnel from the ue and

3038
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:15,679
some local service can provide in the is

3039
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:17,040
msa

3040
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:20,000
traditionally a dns procedure will be

3041
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,360
needed when the ue access the this local

3042
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:25,599
service in the mesa

3043
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:28,719
we introduce a mechanism that can access

3044
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:31,760
the service directly without with a dns

3045
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:34,480
procedure

3046
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:38,239
and this page involves the mechanism

3047
01:58:38,239 --> 01:58:40,400
you have a session with the upl medium

3048
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:44,159
let me see and the ue know that

3049
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:46,480
it can access the service more quickly

3050
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,480
within the messy

3051
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:51,199
and we think that the ue and the amnesty

3052
01:58:51,199 --> 01:58:55,360
is a limited domain so the uae can

3053
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:57,840
do two attempt

3054
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:00,639
the first attempt is the normal tns

3055
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:02,400
request for example

3056
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,560
request a service

3057
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,560
from this

3058
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:09,560
www.localweather.com

3059
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:12,800
and the second attempt is

3060
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,199
it can make a destination

3061
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:17,199
address itself

3062
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:20,320
for example by charging the url

3063
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:24,080
so it can use this ip destination ip

3064
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:26,080
tool to access the service directory

3065
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:28,159
bypass dns

3066
01:59:28,159 --> 01:59:32,159
if this attempt to success the ue senses

3067
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:33,599
directly

3068
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:35,440
and uh

3069
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,760
we think uh

3070
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,719
the way oh making the destination

3071
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:42,960
address is

3072
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,239
there are several options and so we

3073
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:47,840
propose the

3074
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:50,320
draft to

3075
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,000
to see whether

3076
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,880
uh more people are interested uh thank

3077
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:57,280
you that's all

3078
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:00,639
uh any comments

3079
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:05,440
oh

3080
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:08,480
sorry um the queue was close to the last

3081
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:11,440
one but you do have three

3082
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,960
people on the queue two people on the

3083
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,560
queue

3084
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:17,119
three people

3085
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:20,000
benjamin

3086
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,040
hi ben schwartz

3087
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,520
it seems to me that uh anything that

3088
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:30,400
involves hashing the url creates a

3089
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:34,320
privacy violation it reveals the

3090
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,400
path information from something like an

3091
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,840
https url which is

3092
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:42,000
confidential uh that's that's one

3093
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,040
concern

3094
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:45,520
uh also even if this were somehow

3095
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:48,159
restricted to the domain name

3096
02:00:48,159 --> 02:00:51,599
uh with the advent of dns privacy

3097
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:52,639
it is

3098
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:55,599
far from a given that the domain name is

3099
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:57,199
considered public information that may

3100
02:00:57,199 --> 02:00:59,040
also be considered private information

3101
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:01,440
that shouldn't be revealed in the ip

3102
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,960
address which is necessarily public

3103
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:08,360
um

3104
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:11,760
tom hill um i'm just being quick bt um

3105
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,280
how do you

3106
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:16,080
sorry excuse me i'll speak up um how

3107
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:18,320
when you are hashing the url do you make

3108
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,080
sure that it does not

3109
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:22,800
uh resolve to an ip address

3110
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:26,880
that squats on someone else's ip address

3111
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:30,480
which you then have to root internally

3112
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,520
we think

3113
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:32,480
it's a

3114
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,800
limited domain and we do not have too

3115
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:37,119
much this local services need to be

3116
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:38,960
hashed

3117
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,880
perhaps several

3118
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:42,560
important services

3119
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,960
needed this low latency service

3120
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,679
so

3121
02:01:45,679 --> 02:01:50,040
we think that there are no conflicts

3122
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:51,920
okay

3123
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:54,239
okay thank you

3124
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:55,840
okay thank you very much

3125
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:57,520
we are off time and we won't have time

3126
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:59,520
to to run the questions but we did have

3127
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,719
uh three authors uh asking for

3128
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:04,239
adoption and feedback from the group so

3129
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:06,320
we'll take that to the list uh regarding

3130
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:07,280
sets

3131
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:10,960
uh ip policing before policing ip parcel

3132
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:14,000
from fred and the uh internet addressing

3133
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,960
gaps from luigi so we'll take those uh

3134
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:18,560
on the list

3135
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,560
thank you very much everyone

3136
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:22,580
