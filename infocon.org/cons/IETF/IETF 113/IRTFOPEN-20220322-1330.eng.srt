at home at that desk at the front

session using uh miteco using uh

108
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,479
probably the light version of the meet

109
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,360
echo tool and you can join that uh

110
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,840
there's a special icon in the data

111
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,160
tracker agenda which allows you to join

112
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,599
using that tool

113
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,319
um and you need to use uh meet echo to

114
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,160
join the microphone queue since we're

115
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,800
managing a uniform microphone queue for

116
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,960
both the local and the online

117
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,440
participants

118
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,879
and if you're using the the on-site

119
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,039
version of muteco keep your audio and

120
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,680

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,840
for remote participants

122
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,919
please leave your audio and video off

123
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,120
unless you're

124
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
cheering or presenting or asking a

125
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,880
question during the session

126
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,679
and again there's a raise hand button

127
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,200
you can use to join the queue if you

128
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,440
have questions

129
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
um if you're having uh issues with the

130
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,880
the av equipment uh the the url on the

131
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,080
slide um allows you to report those uh

132
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
or um mention

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,680
me tekko in in the chat

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
okay um so as i say this is the irtf

135
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,680
open meeting um and the the goals of the

136
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,480
irtf are a focus on some of the longer

137
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,360
term

138
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,120
research issues relating to the internet

139
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,680
and the irtf works in parallel to the

140
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,080
ietf uh which does the the more short

141
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,399
term issues relating to engineering and

142
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,120
standards making

143
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,760
um my my usual reminder that the iatif

144
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,920
is a research organization no it's not a

145
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,279
standards development organization um

146
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,000
in the irtf we're here to do research

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,760
and we're here to provide a venue where

148
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
the uh academic

149
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
research community the industry research

150
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,880
community

151
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,600
uh can interact with the the engineers

152
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
and and the standard setters uh in the

153
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,200
ietf

154
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
but this is primarily a discussion forum

155
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
and it's and it's a forum to make

156
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
connections

157
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
um and while the irtf um because it's

158
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,120
associated with the ietf can publish uh

159
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,760
informational or experiment uh

160
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
experimental documents as rfcs the

161
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
primary output of the research groups is

162
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,560
expected to be

163
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,600
understanding and research results

164
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,800
and academic papers primarily

165
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,839
rather than necessarily rfcs

166
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,160
the

167
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,640
irtf is structured as a number of

168
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,399
research groups um the the slide uh

169
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,160
shows the groups which are currently

170
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,040
active

171
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,399
those which are

172
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,880

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,799
acm sitcom conference last year

343
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,840
singita over to you

344
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,240
i think you'll meet it still

345
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
uh can you hear me now

346
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
yes

347
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,760
hi everyone i am sangeeta abdul jyoti

348
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,919
i'm an assistant professor at university

349
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,919
of california ry and an affiliated

350
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,480
researcher at vmware research

351
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,799
today i'll be presenting my recent work

352
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,760
on

353
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,840
understanding the impact of a cosmic

354
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,160
phenomenon that is capable of taking

355
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
down the internet which is solar

356
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,240
superstorms

357
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,919
what are the impacts of losing internet

358
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,360
connectivity

359
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,600
we know that it can affect our

360
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,120
professional and social life

361
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,919
significantly especially now during the

362
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,360
pandemic

363
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,799
for large businesses the impact can be

364
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,240
devastating

365
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,039
the revenue loss per hour for some of

366
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,679
the most companies are estimated to be

367
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,559
tens of millions of dollars

368
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,600
and at the scale of countries it can be

369
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,080
hundreds of millions per hour or in

370
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,679
billions per day

371
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,760
and it's not just the economic impact

372
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,039
many of the other critical

373
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,679
infrastructure such as health care uh

374
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,600
depend on the that depend on the

375
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,280
internet and will be severely affected

376
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,080
now

377
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,120
what if we have an internet outage

378
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,840
lasting weeks or months and spanning

379
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,400
large areas across the globe

380
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,320
one might think that such a global

381
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,240
outage is never going to happen because

382
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,080
the internet is racing and distributed

383
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,799
systems um

384
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,280
but unfortunately this is a worst case

385
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,200
scenario that could happen in our

386
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,840
lifetime

387
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
the next once in a hundred year disaster

388
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,919
after this panoramic could be a solar

389
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,799
super storm that is capable of taking

390
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,039
down large parts of the internet

391
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,799
and today network researchers and

392
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,440
operators overlook this threat while

393
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
building a infrastructure

394
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,280
in this talk i'll present a deeper view

395
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,480
of this natural disaster and its impact

396
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,559
on various internet infrastructure

397
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,559
components

398
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
there are two types of solar events that

399
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
are popularly known as solar storms they

400
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,000
are solar flares and coral mass

401
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
ejections

402
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
their impact on in global infrastructure

403
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,280
varies widely

404
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,400
solar storms are

405
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,280
sorry oh yeah solar flares involve large

406
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
amounts of emitted energy

407
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,559
uh in the form of um electromagnetic

408
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,440
radiation so they essentially flashes of

409
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,280
light that

410
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,400
reach the earth in just eight minutes

411
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,280
fortunately they mostly affect only the

412
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,240
upper legs of the atmosphere and do not

413
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
cause any damages to the telescope

414
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,880
infrastructure

415
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,840
but they do affect satellite

416
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,360
communication

417
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,679
now coronal mass ejections

418
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,240
involve emission of electrically charged

419
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,400
solar matter and the accompanying

420
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,120
magnetic field into the space

421
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,280
and these cmes can take anywhere from 13

422
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,240
hours to 5 days to reach the earth based

423
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,799
on their speed

424
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,280
and these cmes are capable of causing

425
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,760
significant uh damages to crystal

426
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,080
infrastructure so cmes are the focus of

427
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,799
this talk and we'll discuss their impact

428
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,960
more closely soon

429
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,720
both solar flares and uh cmes originate

430
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
near um

431
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,559
temporary dark spots on the sun caused

432
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,960
by concentration of magnetic field flux

433
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,520
and which are sunspots

434
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,360
and when the number of sunspots on the

435
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,679
surface of the sun increases there is a

436
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,919
higher probability of cmes occurring

437
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,840
now how do how exactly do these cmes

438
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,360
affect us

439
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,600
the magnetized uh cmes are highly

440
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,039
directional

441
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,159
and when the earth is in the direct part

442
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,039
of a cme it interacts with the earth's

443
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,480
magnetic field

444
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,280
and induces large electric field on the

445
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,360
earth's surface through electromagnetic

446
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,440
induction

447
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,080
and this can cause geomagnetically

448
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,720
induced currents to flow through long

449
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,799
cables that have ground connections that

450
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,880
are located far apart on the earth's

451
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,799
crust and this could include power

452
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,440
transmission lines oil pipelines and

453
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,320
internet uh cables that have an electric

454
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,600
connection that

455
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,960
spans hundreds of thousands of

456
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,960
kilometers

457
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,080
now next let's look at some of the

458
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,919
characteristics of these induced

459
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,679
currents to better understand the risk

460
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,039
so due to the orientation of the earth's

461
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,600
magnetic field higher latitudes are at a

462
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,159
significantly higher risk and it's for

463
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,880
the same reason that auroras are common

464
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,360
closer to the poles

465
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,240
and since the um

466
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,360
this

467
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,120
impact is caused by interactions with

468
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,600
the earth's magnetic field the induced

469
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,400
currents can affect wide areas and are

470
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,039
not uh just restricted to the portion of

471
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,880
the earth that is facing the sun

472
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,320
the gic is only used in cables with

473
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,200
ground connections and a conductor uh

474
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,279
where the ground connections are located

475
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,200
far apart on the earth's surface

476
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,679
and finally the orientation of the

477
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,480
conductor uh does not uh impact uh the

478
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,600
risk associated with uh gic uh so the

479
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,360
north south or east-west orientation of

480
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,279
the cable does not influence the induced

481
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,039
current

482
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,840
so that was a quick overview

483
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,159
now let's move on to the more important

484
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,840
question

485
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,559
when will a large event that affects the

486
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,200
earth happen next

487
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
so solar events are extremely uh hard to

488
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
predict just like earthquakes or any

489
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,720
other natural disasters

490
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,960
small scale solar storms happen all the

491
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,760
time

492
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,240
what we are more interested in are solar

493
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,400
super storms that can have a significant

494
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,960
impact on our lives

495
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,559
so the largest solar events on record

496
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,799
occurred in 1859 and 1921 long before

497
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,200
the advent of modern technology

498
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,559
the 1859 event is popularly known as the

499
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,000
carrington event

500
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
and both these events triggered

501
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,200
extensive power outages and caused

502
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,360
significant damage uh to the

503
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,679
communication network of that time which

504
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,480
was the telegraph network and the

505
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,880
carrington scale event missed the earth

506
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,919
by just a week in 2012 very recently

507
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,200
now the estimates of uh estimates for

508
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,880
probability of occurrence of such

509
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,200
extreme space weather events that

510
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,360
directly impact the earth

511
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,880
ranges from 1.6 percentage to 12 per

512
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,159
decade

513
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,919
but that's not all

514
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,000
the risk is not uniform uh across the

515
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,320
years

516
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,400
because the solar activity goes through

517
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,360
cycles so here we have the variation in

518
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,520
the number of sun spots across years

519
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,080
from 1700 or so to until recently

520
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,960
um and here we can see that the solar

521
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,480
activity waxes and rains in cycles with

522
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,400
a period length of approximately 11

523
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,679
years

524
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,080
so during solar maxima there's an

525
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,799
increase in the number of sunspots and

526
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,039
hence an increase in the frequency of uh

527
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,919
cmes and other solar elements

528
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,120
and it's not just that the solar cyc

529
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,960
solar activity also goes through a

530
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,440
longer term cycle that is approximately

531
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
80 to 100 years

532
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,320
uh so the peak solar activity

533
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,400
very significantly across this hundred

534
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,000
year cycle as well

535
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,720
so this causes the frequency of uh solar

536
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,880
events to vary by a factor of four

537
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,679
across solar maxima uh in this hundred

538
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,840
year cycle

539
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,799
and if we zoom in we can see that modern

540
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,440
technological advancement coincided with

541
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,559
the period of weak solar activity in the

542
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,799
uh past three decades

543
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,240
now we are at the beginning of solar

544
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,120
cycle 25 and the sun is expected to

545
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,760
become more active in the near future

546
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,039
uh but due to the absence of extreme

547
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,520
activity in the recent past we have

548
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,600
overlooked the impact of these events on

549
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,000
the internet infrastructure

550
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,720
so the bottom line here is that

551
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,120
large event could happen soon and the

552
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,360
impact is enough that we should prepare

553
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,520
our infrastructure for it today we have

554
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,840
very limited understanding of how this

555
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,918
would affect our internet infrastructure

556
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,760
so how are various internet components

557
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,200
affected

558
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
so let's start with a wired

559
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,440
infrastructure

560
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,360
localized infrastructure such as data

561
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,399
centers can be protected from

562
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,440
voltage surges caused by cmes using

563
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,600
transient voltage surge suppressors

564
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,799
which are really relatively inexpensive

565
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,600
so they are mostly safe

566
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,240
now long distance cables constitute the

567
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,000
most vulnerable

568
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,120
confidence in the internet

569
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
infrastructure

570
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,440
so today we know that long distance land

571
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,919
and submarine cables carry signals in

572
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,360
optical fibers

573
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,919
and this optical fiber itself is immune

574
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,840
to induced currents uh because it

575
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
carries light and not uh electric

576
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,720
current

577
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,159
but these cables also have repeaters at

578
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,360
50 to 150 kilometer intervals

579
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,919
and uh which are connected in series and

580
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,080
powered by a conductor that runs along

581
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
the length of the cable

582
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,200
and this conductor is susceptible to

583
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,520
damages from induced currents

584
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,679
so today we don't have any good failure

585
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,159
models for understanding the failure

586
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,360
characteristics of long distance cables

587
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,559
uh but

588
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,039
the expected induced voltages along the

589
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,919
length of the cable could be uh one or

590
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,159
two orders of magnitude higher than what

591
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,760
the power system associated with the

592
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,200
cable today can is capable of handling

593
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,440
and today's cables have not been

594
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,440
stressed tested on the uh

595
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,000
induced voltages that could be caused by

596
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,279
a carrington scale event

597
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,840
so long distance cables are in short

598
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,440
vulnerable internet routers can be

599
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,600
protected from direct voltage surges

600
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,480
using voltage suppressors so most of our

601
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
localized infrastructure can be

602
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,039
protected so they are safe

603
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,200
now moving on to wireless infrastructure

604
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,679
um satellites are directly exposed to

605
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,679
solar storms they generally have

606
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,840
radiation shielding for protection from

607
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,760
high energy electrons

608
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,600
but with very strong storms uh

609
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,320
can cause electrons to penetrate deeper

610
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,799
into the interior regions of satellite

611
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,720
and damage its electronic confidence

612
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,360
and uh solar storms can also cause drag

613
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,919
on satellites which can lead to uh

614
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,559
satellites losing their orbit and

615
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,039
re-entering the atmosphere and burning

616
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,760
up

617
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,960
so very recently uh there was news on 40

618
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,679
starling satellites that were lost to

619
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,919
geomagnetic storm when a small scale

620
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,000
storm hit uh but the

621
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,080
the satellites were just being deployed

622
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,240
and they were at lower altitudes where

623
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,279
this risk of drag is much higher um and

624
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,200
that's how they were lost so satellites

625
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,760
in general are vulnerable and um

626
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,640
and this is well known

627
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,520
uh cell towers are protected from direct

628
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,000
exposure because they're on the

629
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,600
on the ground and

630
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
protected by the atmosphere

631
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,720
similarly personal devices such as

632
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,600
laptops laptops and mobile phones are

633
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
also safe

634
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,440
so to summarize long distance cables and

635
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
satellites are the most vulnerable

636
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,120
components of the internet

637
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,279
um other components could suffer from

638
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,120
power outages but they are not

639
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,360
susceptible to direct damages

640
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,039
now analyzing the uh impact so to

641
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,720
understand the impact on internet

642
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,039
infrastructure i looked at a broad

643
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,600
set of data sets uh comprising of

644
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,760
various internet components

645
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,840
so uh the submarine uh cable map

646
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,799
uh

647
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,399
consists of submarine cables in

648
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,399
connecting various continents

649
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,799
and then the itu cable map contains land

650
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,799
cable information from across the globe

651
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,600
collected from regional entities

652
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,440
uh inter tubes data set

653
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,600
includes long-haul fiber cables in the

654
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,918
us

655
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,240
and then i also looked at publicly

656
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,080
available internet exchange point

657
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,279
locations

658
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,360
dns root server locations

659
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,039
and finally

660
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,720
router locations

661
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,840
with autonomous system mapping

662
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,639
from kaira

663
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,840
and

664
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,799
and here we look at the distribution of

665
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,640
summary in uh

666
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,600
cable endpoints

667
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,880
so we know that uh higher latitudes are

668
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,760
more vulnerable to uh induced currents

669
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,799
from solar events particularly latitudes

670
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,440
above the 40 degree threshold so above

671
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,279
40 degree north and below 40 degrees

672
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,320
south

673
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,960
so we evaluate the distribution of

674
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,600
infrastructure components in this

675
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,679
region

676
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,679
so here we have the

677
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,000
probability density function across

678
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,279
various latitudes plotted on the x axis

679
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,200
so we look at the distribution of

680
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,799
population and summary cable endpoints

681
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,960
and we see that the population is more

682
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,000
concentrated on lower latitudes while

683
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,159
submarine cable endpoints are

684
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,240
concentrated on higher latitudes

685
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,200
especially between the us and europe uh

686
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,840
we see a higher concentration of

687
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,279
submarine cable

688
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,720
in points at

689
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,000
more vulnerable regions

690
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,960
now

691
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
uh next we look at

692
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,279
uh distribution of various internet

693
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,840
infrastructure components across

694
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,080
the way across the latitudes

695
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,200
so here

696
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
on the x-axis we have the latitude

697
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,120
threshold and on the y-axis we have

698
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,000
concentration of infrastructure

699
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,399
component the internet routers xps or

700
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,799
dns root servers above that threshold

701
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,600
so the most vulnerable region is above

702
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,080
the 40 degree threshold which is denoted

703
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,159
by the dotted line here

704
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,399
and here we can see that only

705
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,880
about 16 percent of the population is in

706
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,080
this region

707
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,799
but 35 to 45 percent of the internet

708
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,399
infrastructure is in the vulnerable

709
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,600
region

710
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,919
and this holds for other components as

711
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,440
well you can see more

712
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,559
analysis in the paper

713
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,760
so the key takeaway here is that

714
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,520
internet infrastructure components are

715
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,520
skewed towards more vulnerable regions

716
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,480
next we look at um cable length analysis

717
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,800
so here on the x-axis

718
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,760
we have a cable length in kilometers in

719
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,040
long scale

720
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,280
so this is the this is a comparison of

721
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,119
cdfs of length of lan cables versus

722
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,359
submarine cables

723
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,040
here the submarine cable data set is

724
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,159
complete uh it it comprises of almost

725
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,040
all existing submarine cables uh the lan

726
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,440
cable data set is not complete but if

727
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,359
this was the largest publicly available

728
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,440
data set

729
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,560
so here um

730
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,839
shorter cables don't need repeaters only

731
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,079
cables have a longer than 150 kilometer

732
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,440
need repeaters

733
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,599
and need that conductor along the length

734
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,079
of the cable which is susceptible to the

735
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,680
damages

736
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,839
so here we observe that

737
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,560
uh more than 70 percent of the land

738
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,960
cables don't need repeaters and hence

739
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,880
are not vulnerable

740
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,160
but only about um 20 percent of the

741
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
submarine cables are shorter than this

742
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,520
threshold

743
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,920
which means that nearly eighty percent

744
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,680
of the submarine cables

745
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,160
need uh repeaters and hence are

746
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,720
susceptible to damages from induced

747
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,119
currents

748
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,359
so in short submarine cables are more

749
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,480
vulnerable than land cables

750
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,400
and next we also look at

751
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
we also conducted a repeater failure

752
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,640
analysis based on latitude based failure

753
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,599
models

754
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,040
so there were several interesting

755
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,839
observations

756
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,480
the u.s faces a higher risk of losing

757
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,560
connectivity to europe during a solar

758
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,359
superstar so in the east coast most

759
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,440
cables between the us and europe are

760
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,680
concentrated between the northeast and

761
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,560
the northeast of the us and the uk

762
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,079
which is most likely done for lower

763
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,359
latency

764
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,520
and there are no connections from

765
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,480
florida to southern europe uh which is

766
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,000
in the less vulnerable region

767
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,320
um

768
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,800
but when we look at cables between

769
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,040
brazil and europe um they're less

770
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,280
vulnerable so it was surprising to find

771
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,200
that the cable between brazil and

772
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,839
southern europe is shorter than all

773
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,400
cables between the u.s and raw europe

774
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,160
and it's also located in the less

775
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,240
vulnerable region closer to the equator

776
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,599
in asia singapore has a higher chance of

777
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,760
retaining connectivity to neighboring

778
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,079
countries even under severe storms

779
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,200
because cables are much shorter and also

780
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,520
located in lower latitudes

781
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,720
that are less vulnerable

782
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,520
and here we have uh locations of public

783
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,599
data centers across the globe

784
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,560
red shows uh higher density followed by

785
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,240
orange and then blue

786
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
so we observed that data centers are

787
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,440
concentrated in um vulnerable high

788
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,720
latitudes

789
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,640
and this observation also holds for

790
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,560
hyperscale providers such as google

791
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,640
facebook microsoft etc

792
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,680
um

793
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,000
now while data centers won't suffer

794
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,520
direct damages

795
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,440
access to these data centers can be

796
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,520
affected uh during a solar event

797
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,760
what what other infrastructure

798
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,119
components

799
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,320
so here we have some results on analysis

800
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,079
of on over uh dns and the domain system

801
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,280
and the autonomous systems connectivity

802
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,640
um

803
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,520
dns root servers are highly distributed

804
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,920
and hence they'll remain reachable even

805
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,640
under very high network partitioning

806
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,200
however location data on top level

807
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,520
domain servers and other authoritative

808
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,680
servers was not available so that

809
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,240
analysis has not been done yet but root

810
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,920
servers are highly distributed and

811
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,000
reachable

812
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,880
when we analyze autonomous systems we

813
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,560
see that a large fraction of ass

814
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,240
have a presence in vulnerable regions

815
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,040
but the vast majority of asses have a

816
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,839
smaller spread

817
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,800
so uh

818
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,079
next i

819
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,839
discuss some of the open questions and

820
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,759
challenges related to this thread

821
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,200
so the paper my work primarily looked at

822
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,119
internet partitioning based on submarine

823
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,960
cables alone

824
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,160
um

825
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
understanding the impact on end-to-end

826
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,480
behavior of applications remain an open

827
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
challenge this needs to take into

828
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,880
account both land and submarine cables

829
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,960
and also better failure models for

830
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,680
cable failures so currently there are

831
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,480
some geophysicists working on developing

832
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,280
failure models for um internet cables

833
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,800
um

834
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,040
now the primary analysis only looked at

835
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,119
dns root servers to understand

836
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,440
availability of the infrastructure we

837
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,079
need to analyze the distribution of top

838
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,480
top level domain servers and

839
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,880
authoritative servers uh the extent of

840
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,560
caching etc

841
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,720
uh to understand uh the resiliency of

842
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,839
the entire system

843
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,160
another interesting question is how is

844
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,320
as level connectivity affected by large

845
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,040
scale network partitioning

846
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,400
next we need to devise solutions for

847
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,079
improving long-term resilience of the

848
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,359
infrastructure

849
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,119
for example this could involve um adding

850
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,359
new cables in locations that are less

851
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,760
vulnerable

852
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
uh another interesting

853
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,440
direction could be the design of

854
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,280
inter-domain protocols or extension of

855
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,760
current ones to improve path diversity

856
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,319
in the wide area network during um

857
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,880
disasters

858
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,760
um another interesting thing with cmes

859
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,680
is that uh the lead time so cmes that

860
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,800
originate at this uh on the sun will

861
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,359
reach the earth only 13 hours to five

862
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,359
days later

863
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,000
so this gives us a short interval to

864
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,599
prepare for impact

865
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,599
so how can we use this lead time

866
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,040
effectively

867
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,200
we can develop plans that allow us to

868
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,520
prepare for an impact so maybe we can

869
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,839
cache data across data centers uh

870
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,800
globally in an effective way uh how can

871
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,040
internet service providers react do we

872
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,200
need to increase cache time in the dns

873
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
system so there are a lot of interesting

874
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,520
questions on how we can use this lead

875
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,400
time effectively

876
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,760
and um

877
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,240
more importantly

878
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,560
we also need to rethink our models of

879
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,079
failure analysis

880
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,079
so current best practices on fault

881
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,640
tolerance and resilience evaluation

882
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,800
rely on failure models that consider a

883
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
limited number of failures

884
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,200
so we need to test our systems and

885
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,280
applications under large scale failure

886
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,839
scenarios

887
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,839
um

888
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,200
um another interesting uh direction for

889
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,560
research is related to uh reconnecting a

890
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,160
partition internet

891
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,040
uh after a solar superstorm the internet

892
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,839
may be partitioned or uh due to failures

893
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,480
in long distance cables or power outages

894
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,560
in certain parts of the globe

895
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,359
now um can we look at alternative

896
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,400
solutions that can provide temporary uh

897
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,200
connectivity after an impact so examples

898
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,760
could be uh internet collected balloons

899
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,240
or high altitude platform stations that

900
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,440
are mobile

901
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,119
and um

902
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,119
ideally these solutions should rely on

903
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,520
renewable power sources such as solar

904
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,599
energy to guarantee connectivity even

905
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,839
during power outages so that's another

906
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,279
interesting direction of research

907
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,160
finally internet and power grids are

908
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,599
both uh designated as uniquely critical

909
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,160
because all other critical systems rely

910
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,200
on them

911
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,960
they are also interdependent on each

912
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,280
other and both are susceptible to

913
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,520
failures from solar superstorms

914
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,920
hence we need to study the joint failure

915
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,480
characteristics of this complex in the

916
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,079
dependent system

917
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:50,960
um

918
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,040
they also have very different failure

919
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,720
characteristics for example if we

920
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
consider the united states there are

921
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,119
three regional power grids the western

922
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,240
interconnection eastern in the

923
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,520
connection and texas interconnect

924
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,000
now if the power grid in the east face

925
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,319
it only it will not cause any

926
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,680
significant effects or overload on

927
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,520
the western inner connection

928
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,240
but on the other hand if all cables

929
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,440
connecting to uh the east coast fail

930
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,079
um there'll be significant shifts in bgp

931
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,040
paths and potential overload in

932
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,640
cables on the west coast

933
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,440
so

934
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
internet is more global compared to

935
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,240
power grids and even regional failures

936
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,480
can do something significant

937
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,880
consequences for the broader internet

938
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,960
so understanding the interdependency is

939
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,880
an interesting question

940
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,960
so these are just a few open problems

941
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,040
there are many more

942
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,440
uh now to summarize

943
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,680
um

944
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,880
so space weather particularly coronal

945
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,680
mass ejections from the sun pose a

946
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,359
significant risk to our internet

947
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,078
infrastructure

948
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,200
and

949
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
modern technological advancement

950
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,280
coincided with the period of weak solar

951
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,440
activity so the internet infrastructure

952
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,839
has not been stress tested under strong

953
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,079
solar events

954
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,000
and the complete um

955
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,960
extent of this threat is yet to be

956
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,359
estimated

957
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,200
uh internet infrastructure components

958
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,119
are skewed towards highly vulnerable

959
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,839
regions in the higher latitudes and this

960
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,839
can affect the overall resilience of the

961
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,000
system based on preliminary analysis but

962
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,680
a lot more work needs to be done in this

963
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,920
context

964
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,319
and finally uh we need to work towards

965
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,560
better understanding and improving the

966
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,560
resilience of the global internet

967
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,440
infrastructure um with that i'll

968
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,599
conclude my talk thank you and i'm happy

969
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,000
to take questions

970
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,520
okay thank you

971
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,480
computer very interesting talk

972
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,280
uh

973
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,079
a

974
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,200
really interesting problem you're

975
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,960
looking at here

976
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,240
um

977
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,839
where's do you have a question

978
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:08,880
i do

979
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,480
uh so first off thank you for the

980
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,640
excellent work um i'm a ham radio

981
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,160
operator and we'll pass this on to some

982
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,280
friends that are interested in it

983
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,880
because we we consider that type of

984
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,720
stuff all the time there's a number of

985
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,000
ham radio operators in the atf um i'm

986
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,079
also a root server operator and so one

987
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,079
of the things that i'm interested in is

988
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,720
is it's worth noting first off that the

989
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,839
root instances or dns instances you know

990
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,240
maybe that their particular installation

991
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,960
does not you know pose a problem but

992
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,440
if they become disconnected from the

993
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,040
rest of the system then they will fail

994
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,440
to get updates at which point dns will

995
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,079
stop you know uh validating after you

996
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,720
know a while as the signatures expire in

997
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,359
the regardless of the zone um did you

998
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,240
study islands or did you find you know

999
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,520
isolated islands of

1000
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,960
communication where

1001
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,800
they would be functionally cut off i

1002
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,400
mean the nice thing about the routing

1003
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,160
system is that you know if a major cable

1004
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,680
gets taken out but maybe there's a link

1005
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,680
to greenland to you know something like

1006
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,040
that that you can actually still get

1007
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,119
traffic through it'll become congested

1008
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,160
but did you

1009
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,640
were able to identify any uh particular

1010
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,880
areas that are completely shut off where

1011
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,880
you know they'd be disc uh

1012
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,319
completely cut off from communication

1013
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,839
for a while

1014
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,440
yeah that's a that's a very important

1015
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,839
question uh so i don't have a

1016
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,400
complete answer yet so my my initial

1017
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,560
paper only looked at uh

1018
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,720
primary regions of uh

1019
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,720
that will be affected but not the end to

1020
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,280
end disconnection on the complete graph

1021
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,280
uh so currently i have students that are

1022
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,400
working on this topic so i don't have a

1023
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,359
complete answer yet but um

1024
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,839
it could be possible that there are very

1025
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,079
big islands but not um

1026
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,040
not a lot of tiny islands it seems like

1027
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,640
uh so that based on the preliminary

1028
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,599
analysis it uh most of asia and

1029
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,520
so the asia to europe connection will

1030
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,960
probably stay

1031
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,200
but uh the us uh to europe might be more

1032
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,960
affected uh so uh complete disconnection

1033
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,680
uh i don't know at this point but a

1034
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,680
significant reduction in capacity

1035
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,280
between the

1036
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,880
bigger land masses is possible

1037
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,640
okay thank you

1038
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,720
anyone else have questions first in

1039
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,720
jesus

1040
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,760
a little bit of chat about

1041
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,160
vulnerability of satellites in in the

1042
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,000
chat um

1043
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,880
i don't know if you saw that

1044
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,520
yeah so yeah the question on um

1045
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,480
uh the satellite impact on satellites so

1046
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,200
uh nicolas has

1047
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,040
there are regular solar storms and apart

1048
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,200
from startling accident with very low

1049
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,440
earth orbit satellites satellites are

1050
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,599
fine do you have pointers to justify the

1051
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,520
assumptions on satellites

1052
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,440
yeah so that's a very important question

1053
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,640
um

1054
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,480
so uh

1055
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,160
as i mentioned in the talks these

1056
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,200
satellites have protective covering so

1057
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,480
uh so uh typically

1058
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,200
they're deployed they have a children

1059
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,640
that can protect them from solar

1060
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,040
activity for their lifespan which is

1061
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,960
five to ten years or so

1062
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,880
so uh it was only in the past decade or

1063
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,520
two that the number of satellites grew

1064
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,240
really exponentially um and we have not

1065
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,680
had a very large storm since then

1066
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,960
um

1067
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,200
so the starling satellites were affected

1068
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,920
because uh after they were installed at

1069
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,960
the lower altitude than their final

1070
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,720
orbit um

1071
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,960
two back to back very small scale

1072
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,839
stormed uh storms happened so uh the

1073
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,040
solar

1074
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,760
storms are ranged uh

1075
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,440
thus the

1076
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,240
the uh intensity of these storms they

1077
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,520
are uh

1078
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,880
they range from g1 to g5 where g1 being

1079
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,040
the weakest and g5 being the strongest

1080
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,119
so the storms that hit the starling

1081
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,280
satellites were g1 which were really

1082
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,240
weak

1083
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,240
but it took down the satellites because

1084
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
the satellites were at a lower altitude

1085
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,119
than

1086
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,319
their final destination altitude

1087
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,119
now

1088
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,319
if a g5 which is the most intense storm

1089
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,440
happens

1090
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,079
we don't know the impact what the impact

1091
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,319
would be um at

1092
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,000
even the current uh orbital altitudes so

1093
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
uh the radiation shielding can offer

1094
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,160
some amount of protection but it's not

1095
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,359
guaranteed that um they'll be completely

1096
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,319
protected and not just that um these

1097
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,880
satellites fall out of orbit very often

1098
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,040
and they have mechanisms to uh they

1099
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,240
orbit and to in order to do that we need

1100
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,240
to we need to have connection with the

1101
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,800
earth ground stations which can detect

1102
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,640
the current altitude and correct the uh

1103
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,800
satellite's position and the solar storm

1104
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,160
can ha um

1105
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,960
extend for hours maybe 10 to 12 hours in

1106
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,680
the case of varying then storms so if we

1107
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,079
lose connectivity to a satellite for

1108
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,160
such extended periods and they fall out

1109
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,119
of orbit uh it is possible that

1110
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,800
they could fault even though there are

1111
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,800
thrusters if we cannot communicate with

1112
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,520
the satellites they could get damaged

1113
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,599
so before the current international

1114
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,599
space station was installed u.s had um

1115
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,240
something called skylab uh which was the

1116
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,880
previous space station uh and that was

1117
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,760
destroyed in the 1970s during the uh

1118
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,520
large solar storm

1119
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,400
and they couldn't connect with it uh to

1120
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,119
push push it back up into the orbit so

1121
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,280
with very large storms that extend for

1122
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,160
hours

1123
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,480
it is possible that satellites could be

1124
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,640
destroyed but we don't we have not

1125
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,520
experienced something that large uh very

1126
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,520
recently

1127
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:23,680
all right does that answer your question

1128
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,480
or are there anything

1129
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,599
yeah so there is a question on uh is the

1130
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,079
impact focused on high latitude or sun

1131
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,400
facing side or are induced currents the

1132
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,680
same globally so when it comes to the

1133
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,559
direct impact on satellites satellites

1134
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,400
that are facing the sun are at a much

1135
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,599
higher risk

1136
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,839
but when we look at the induced currents

1137
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,079
these are caused by interaction of these

1138
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,000
magnetic particles with the

1139
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,559
earth's magnetic field so in the case of

1140
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,200
induced currents um

1141
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,200
it's not just the sun facing side the

1142
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,319
dark side is also equally vulnerable but

1143
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,599
higher latitudes uh on both

1144
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,839
the sun facing side as well as the dark

1145
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,799
side are equally vulnerable

1146
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,000
okay

1147
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,800
thank you i i had a question i mean

1148
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,119
since this is an i etf and irtf meeting

1149
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,359
um is there anything we should be doing

1150
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,920
differently when we design protocols

1151
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,079
which would help with this type of you

1152
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,599
know help with resilience to this type

1153
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,680
of event

1154
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,880
yeah so uh i i think we need to rethink

1155
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,000
uh resilience at every layer of the uh

1156
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,839
stack so uh with dns as i said like we

1157
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,200
know that root servers are uh uh

1158
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,280
very very well distributed but we don't

1159
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,319
know how the uh entire uh tree would

1160
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,119
hierarchically would uh uh kind of fair

1161
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,119
under a solar storm do we need to change

1162
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,079
our caching intervals or uh change how

1163
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,440
we uh manage these dns records that's

1164
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,440
not clear and then when it comes to

1165
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,319
protocols it seems like bgp uh which

1166
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,359
allows only like a single path um that

1167
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,960
might be too restrictive when the

1168
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,520
capacity is severely limited

1169
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,599
so that's another analysis that we what

1170
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,160
we're planning to do like how how would

1171
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,960
um uh bgp affair uh in such a scenario

1172
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,079
uh but

1173
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,559
within an ais like um ospf or um uh the

1174
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,280
other entrance routing protocols will

1175
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,040
fare very well because they are

1176
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,040
decentralized and they can use whatever

1177
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,960
parts are available uh in a

1178
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,119
decentralized fashion so they seem

1179
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,359
mostly safe it's the in their domain

1180
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,440
protocol that needs more investigation

1181
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,160
uh yeah okay that makes sense i guess

1182
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,319
there's a whole bunch of coordination

1183
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,760
issues and management's issues with

1184
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,000
large-scale um

1185
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,319
circuit click cloud cloud provider

1186
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,000
infrastructure networks and so on as

1187
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,760
well yeah

1188
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,880
yep so

1189
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,920
some interesting problems yeah

1190
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,319
okay uh are there any other questions

1191
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,559
for century should we move on to the

1192
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,040
other talk

1193
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,839
dtn over rfc 1149 is clearly the answer

1194
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,520
i assume that say being carriers

1195
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,240
okay uh i guess there were no more

1196
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,720
questions so uh in that case uh thank

1197
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,130
you sanduta excellent talk um

1198
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:51,360
[Applause]

1199
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,920
all right uh next up

1200
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,880
is

1201
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,040
uh bruce spang

1202
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,160
uh

1203
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,799
bruce there yes

1204
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,920
uh so the second award uh today goes to

1205
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,640
bruce spang uh for his work showing that

1206
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,200
networking algorithm a b tests uh can be

1207
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,400
biased because of network congestion

1208
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,599
uh bruce is a fifth year phd candidate

1209
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,559
at stanford uh studying uh internet

1210
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,160
networking video streaming and

1211
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,160
theoretical computer science uh he's

1212
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,079
also been a graduate research fellow at

1213
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,400
netflix for the past three years

1214
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,960
uh working on video algorithms

1215
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,839
uh and in in the past he studied at um

1216
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,000
umass amherst and also worked as a

1217
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,640
software engineer at fastly

1218
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,319
the paper he'll be presenting today is

1219
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,079
unbiased experiments in congested

1220
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,880
networks which was originally presented

1221
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,480
at the acm internet measurement

1222
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,720
conference last year

1223
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,319
um bruce you should be able to press the

1224
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,240
share preloaded slides uh button

1225
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,558
great uh let me just share some stuff

1226
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,000
slides not the screen just listen to you

1227
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,599
instead just for your animation itself

1228
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,920
uh it works better if you can do it with

1229
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,359
the slides but so we can scream

1230
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,599
okay uh

1231
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,359
already when you uh

1232
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,119
great

1233
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,240
well uh thanks so much for the

1234
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240
introduction um and i guess first off i

1235
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,599
wanted to start by saying thank you so

1236
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,440
thank you so much for this award

1237
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,599
um some of my all-time favorite research

1238
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,040
papers have received this award and so

1239
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,799
i'm really honored that our work is also

1240
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,720
receiving this award

1241
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,640
our work is about running experiments in

1242
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,400
congested networks

1243
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,760
um and this is some joint work with

1244
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,960
veronica hannan sravya

1245
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,119
from netflix and my advisors nick mckeon

1246
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,640
and ramesh jahari from stanford

1247
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,319
so we're talking about networking

1248
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,480
research and it's very common networking

1249
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,920
research that we come up with some new

1250
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,319
algorithm and we want to argue that this

1251
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,839
new algorithm is better than the

1252
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,559
existing state of the art

1253
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,240
so we've got a pretty typical way that

1254
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,280
we do this and normally we come up with

1255
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,119
some intuition about why the new album

1256
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,720
is better maybe we run some lab

1257
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,559
experiments that show specific instances

1258
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,799
where the new algorithm is better

1259
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,319
and then finally we'll go and we'll run

1260
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,960
a production a b test so like a

1261
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,960
randomized experiment on actual traffic

1262
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,400
where we try out our new algorithm and

1263
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,599
see if it actually works well in

1264
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,359
practice

1265
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,799
so this is a pretty standard way to

1266
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,960
evaluate algorithms on this slide are a

1267
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,960
couple of papers from the past decade or

1268
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,079
so where they rely on

1269
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,839
an a b test to argue that their approach

1270
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,480
is better than the state of the art

1271
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,960
and so this is just a subset of the the

1272
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,040
papers that have been published and also

1273
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,720
there's lots of unpublished work so the

1274
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,240
team that we work with pretty closely at

1275
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,440
netflix

1276
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,200
they run an av test to test basically

1277
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,559
every single change they make to the

1278
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,319
production algorithm and probably over

1279
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:55,359
the course of the

1280
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,960
year they'll run a couple thousand ap

1281
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,880
tests

1282
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,799
so what is an av test

1283
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,359
so in a b test we have a whole bunch of

1284
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:04,480
users

1285
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,599
and so

1286
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,720
there's

1287
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,040
normally a bunch of smiley faces on this

1288
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,880
slide so imagine a bunch of smiley faces

1289
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,720
here these smiley faces are going to be

1290
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,480
units and these units

1291
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,079
are something like users they're like

1292
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,880
video sessions they're servers and what

1293
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,079
we do is we randomly assign traffic to

1294
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,559
either treatment or control

1295
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,599
we wait for a while we collect some data

1296
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,000
and then we look at the outcomes

1297
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,799
and so the outcomes

1298
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,240
maybe in this case the treatment

1299
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,760
algorithm gets better performance than

1300
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,000
the control algorithm and so we say okay

1301
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,599
we've run a randomized experiment we

1302
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,960
found that the algorithm improves

1303
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,520
performance

1304
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,520
so this

1305
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,119
is a generalization this statement that

1306
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,520
an algorithm improves performance we're

1307
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,119
kind of making a statement about what

1308
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,040
the world would be like if we went and

1309
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,960
deployed the algorithm based on the

1310
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,880
results of an a b test and typically an

1311
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,640
eb test is like a pretty small scale

1312
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,160
experiment maybe

1313
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,000
one percent or less than one percent of

1314
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,319
global traffic

1315
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,839
so this is a fine sort of generalization

1316
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,599
to make but it's a generalization that

1317
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,440
requires some assumptions

1318
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,119
and one of the big assumptions is that

1319
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,200
the outcome of one unit in the test

1320
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,040
doesn't depend on the other units in the

1321
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,040
test so for instance like what happens

1322
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,559
to me when treatment is applied to me

1323
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:21,920
doesn't matter if treatment is applied

1324
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,839
to you

1325
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,200
so this assumption this is called

1326
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,480
interference

1327
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,559
and when interference is present units

1328
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,160
sort of interfere with other units in

1329
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,079
the test and this can bias the outcome

1330
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,960
of a b tests

1331
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,280
so this is sort of a hot topic in an

1332
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,880
area called causal inference which is a

1333
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,240
field of research where we think about

1334
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,000
like experiments and how we know what we

1335
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,240
know is true is true

1336
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,680
and so let me give you a couple examples

1337
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,440
of this sort of interference

1338
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,040
so let's imagine you've got some social

1339
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,280
network and you've got like a messaging

1340
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,280
application for this social network and

1341
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,640
you want to test some new feature for

1342
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,119
this messaging application

1343
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,119
if you randomize users to treatment and

1344
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:00,720
control and this this feature does

1345
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,720
something that like increases usage for

1346
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,240
the treatment group

1347
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,720
then uh maybe this user who's in the

1348
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,160
treatment group goes and messages all

1349
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,359
their friends who are in the control

1350
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,960
group and this will sort of increase

1351
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,640
usage for both the treatment and control

1352
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,240
groups and this will bias the outcome of

1353
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,400
the test

1354
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,559
another example is from online auctions

1355
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,839
or markets and you can think of like

1356
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,000
ebay or airbnb here

1357
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,760
if you've got users that are randomly

1358
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,040
assigned to treatment and control and

1359
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,640
then they compete against each other in

1360
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,480
some sort of auction or to buy some sort

1361
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,760
of product

1362
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,200
then if you do something that makes

1363
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,359
treatment users more likely to win this

1364
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,200
auction then it makes control users more

1365
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,520
likely to lose this option and again you

1366
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,040
have this interference between treatment

1367
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,440
and control

1368
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,559
there's a lot more examples of

1369
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,400
interference out there um we've got a

1370
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,960
link to all sorts of papers in the in

1371
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,799
the presentation or in the paper

1372
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,280
so if we think about it for just a

1373
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,280
little bit i mean this is the rtf we're

1374
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,160
talking about networking

1375
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,440
it should become pretty clear that

1376
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,040
interference exists in congested

1377
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,079
networks

1378
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,599
so we've got treatment traffic and

1379
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,920
control traffic in an av test

1380
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,559
and this traffic shares the internet it

1381
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,079
shares networks in the internet it

1382
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,160
shares cues in the networks routers and

1383
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,480
the networks and links in the network

1384
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,119
and there are things that we know from

1385
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,040
say congestion control research that the

1386
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,960
treatment algorithm can do

1387
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,799
to affect the network so it can do

1388
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,040
things like increase or decrease the

1389
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,480
length of the queues in the network it

1390
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,319
can do things like use more or less

1391
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,520
bandwidth

1392
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,960
and if it does this it'll impact the

1393
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,280
control algorithm

1394
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,640
like the control algorithm could see the

1395
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,920
longer queues or could have less

1396
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,520
bandwidth available to it

1397
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,520
so interference clearly exists in

1398
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,599
congested networks

1399
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,319
but the question is sort of raises two

1400
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,400
questions the first question is like

1401
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,760
does this matter

1402
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,880
so maybe there's a little bit of

1403
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,640
interference a little bit of bias but it

1404
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,160
doesn't really change the outcome of the

1405
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,559
test we run at all

1406
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,000
or maybe it does and maybe it actually

1407
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,680
would sort of significantly change the

1408
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,440
decisions even we would make as a result

1409
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,920
of these tests

1410
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,799
so

1411
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,160
the first question is does it matter and

1412
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,440
if it does matter then what can we do

1413
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,880
about it is there any way we can avoid

1414
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,799
this bias and so in our work we try and

1415
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:14,079
answer both of these questions

1416
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,079
let me start with the first question and

1417
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,680
tell you about an experiment we ran that

1418
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,280
shows that a b test can be extremely

1419
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,880
misleading if there's congestion

1420
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,680
interference present

1421
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,160
so this experiment we ran in cooperation

1422
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,839
with netflix and it was an experiment

1423
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,440
involving bit rate capping so first let

1424
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,960
me tell you about what bit rate capping

1425
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,720
is so back at the beginning of poke 19

1426
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,559
everyone started staying home load on

1427
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,559
the internet went way up

1428
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:41,440
and

1429
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,960
governments around the world worked with

1430
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,480
large video streaming services like

1431
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,839
netflix

1432
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:48,400
to reduce load on the internet and the

1433
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,000
way they did this was by capping click

1434
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,920
rates

1435
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,680
and overall this reduced the load that

1436
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,520
netflix was sending out by about 25

1437
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,720
so what did this mean technically

1438
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,480
so netflix videos are split up into

1439
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,160
segments and each segment you can think

1440
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,760
about as a couple different seconds of

1441
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,880
video

1442
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,799
each segment is encoded at a number of

1443
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,280
different qualities there's a very high

1444
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,200
quality one which looks good but tends

1445
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,440
to be pretty large in terms of bytes

1446
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,960
then there's a range of qualities that

1447
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,520
goes down to some low quality which is

1448
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,760
looks less good but is like much smaller

1449
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,720
and faster to transfer

1450
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,280
so an algorithm goes and it can pick

1451
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,720
each quality level at each segment and

1452
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,079
then at the next segment it can pick a

1453
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,240
different quality level

1454
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,240
for bitrate capping what netflix did was

1455
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,160
just stop serving the highest quality

1456
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,520
levels so they just got rid of those

1457
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,119
and so for the same sort of seconds of

1458
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,720
video the number of bytes you sent would

1459
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,720
be lower and there's a whole bunch of

1460
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,400
technical details here about how to do

1461
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,000
this while respecting the various like

1462
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,599
plans that people had paid for and the

1463
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,920
quality that netflix had promised

1464
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,119
and you can read more about that in the

1465
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,119
paper if you're interested

1466
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,760
but at a very high level netflix limited

1467
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,319
the quality of video and this reduced

1468
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,680
the

1469
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,399
overall traffic

1470
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,960
so this is a an algorithm that we could

1471
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,960
test out and i think it's a pretty

1472
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,039
natural question to ask is like okay so

1473
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,720
let's say we did run an a b test for

1474
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,000
this algorithm

1475
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,039
what would an a b test look like

1476
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,160
so

1477
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,839
let's imagine we've got some congested

1478
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,000
link so this link up here on the top

1479
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,359
left

1480
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,880
and we're thinking about a congested

1481
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,160
link here because the whole point of

1482
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,599
this bit rate capping thing was to

1483
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,000
reduce congestion in the first place

1484
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,440
so let's imagine we took all the traffic

1485
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,599
to this link and capped this traffic

1486
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,440
so this would reduce the bandwidth usage

1487
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,720
and let's say in this case it will

1488
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,280
reduce the bandwidth usage by half

1489
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,799
and what this means is that now there's

1490
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,559
some free space available on this link

1491
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,880
and the link will become not congested

1492
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,640
so there's sort of two treatment effects

1493
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,000
here of bitrate capping that we're

1494
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,240
interested in measuring the first one is

1495
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,240
how much less bandwidth we're using

1496
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,760
and then the second one is how this

1497
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,720
impacts congestion

1498
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,319
so if we were to go and we were to run

1499
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,520
an a b test one possibility is that so

1500
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,200
we've got this captain control traffic

1501
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,280
which is sharing a link

1502
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,599
the cap traffic could sort of reduce the

1503
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,200
data that it's sending the control

1504
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,200
traffic could be not affected and there

1505
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,799
could be some free space available on

1506
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:13,680
the link

1507
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,200
and in this case the link would be not

1508
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,119
congested

1509
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,960
so in an a b test the results that we

1510
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,799
would see is that the cap traffic would

1511
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,319
use less bandwidth than the control

1512
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,799
traffic in fact here it uses the correct

1513
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,480
ratio of less bandwidth so it's using

1514
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,079
half as much bandwidth as the control

1515
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,359
traffic

1516
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,599
but what we wouldn't see is the impact

1517
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,920
on congestion

1518
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,000
because we would be comparing the cap

1519
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,760
traffic to the control traffic and

1520
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,280
they're using the same link which is not

1521
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,359
congested and so we would see similar

1522
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:42,880
metrics for congestion we'd see similar

1523
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,160
packet loss we would see similar

1524
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,359
queueing delay and so on

1525
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,599
a second possibility if we were to run

1526
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,520
an a b test is that the control

1527
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,039
algorithm could be running some sort of

1528
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,640
congestion control algorithm it could be

1529
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,240
doing some sort of adaptive bit-rate

1530
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,760
algorithm and it could notice that

1531
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,440
there's some free space available on the

1532
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,359
link and it could start sending faster

1533
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,280
or higher quality data

1534
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,599
and fill up the rest of the link

1535
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,119
in this situation the link could stay

1536
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,440
congested and in the result of an a b

1537
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,280
test what we would see is that the cat

1538
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,520
traffic is using less bandwidth sort of

1539
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,880
directionally we've got the right

1540
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,720
direction but here we will get the wrong

1541
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,480
ratio so we'll see that it's using about

1542
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,920
a third as much bandwidth instead of

1543
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,799
half as much bandwidth

1544
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:24,480
and then secondly we're also going to

1545
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,559
miss this impact on congestion

1546
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,240
because both again the captain control

1547
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,599
traffic are going to be using the same

1548
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,960
link which is going to be congested

1549
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,640
and so in both of these situations when

1550
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,240
we run an a b test we're not going to

1551
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,079
see what happens with congestion and

1552
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,520
this is sort of a huge bummer because

1553
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,880
the whole point of this algorithm in the

1554
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,839
first place was to reduce congestion

1555
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,599
so now i'd like to tell you about an

1556
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,559
experiment we ran to measure congestion

1557
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,960
uh to measure the sort of actual effect

1558
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,480
of bit rate counting

1559
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,839
and in order to do that i need to

1560
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,599
describe the experiment i rented to you

1561
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,280
and in order to do that let me introduce

1562
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,559
another way of thinking about the same

1563
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:03,920
thing that might make the experiment

1564
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,960
design a little bit cleaner

1565
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,720
so let's imagine we're in this setting

1566
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,559
back here on the right hand side where

1567
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,319
the control traffic is going to respond

1568
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:13,839
to the amount of cap traffic and sort of

1569
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:16,960
fill up the rest of the link

1570
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,799
so in this setting

1571
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:20,880
we can visualize the behavior as follows

1572
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,280
so on the x-axis here is the fraction of

1573
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,880
cap traffic

1574
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,960
on the y-axis is a measurement of per

1575
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,319
session throughput and so we've got a

1576
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:29,920
bunch of different video sessions here

1577
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,760
that are sharing one link and so we can

1578
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,359
look at a per session throughput for

1579
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,359
those video sessions

1580
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:36,720
this line here this is going to be the

1581
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,640
throughput for the cap sessions

1582
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,319
and it doesn't depend on the fraction of

1583
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,480
traffic which is kept because there's

1584
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,640
some sort of upper limit that we send at

1585
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,160
and as we increase the fraction of

1586
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,520
traffic which is capped there'll be more

1587
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,880
space available on the link and so we'll

1588
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,240
continue sending at this upper level

1589
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,920
this line here this is the throughput

1590
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,839
for the control algorithm the algorithm

1591
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,839
which is not doing bit rate capping and

1592
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,359
as more and more traffic is kept we're

1593
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,480
going to be back in the setting where

1594
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,000
the control traffic is going to increase

1595
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,039
the throughput that it gets

1596
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,039
so what we're interested in measuring

1597
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,640
here is what happens if we were to go

1598
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,039
and we were to deploy a bitrate captain

1599
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,200
so that's the difference between 100 of

1600
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,599
traffic is capped which is over here

1601
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,120
on the right hand side

1602
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,120
100 of traffic is running the control

1603
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,399
algorithm which is over here on the

1604
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,759
left-hand side

1605
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:23,040
and the difference between these two

1606
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,640
points we call the total treatment

1607
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,479
effect and this is sort of the quantity

1608
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,759
that we're interested in measuring

1609
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,560
if we were to go run an av test we would

1610
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,080
not necessarily measure the total

1611
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,279
treatment effect

1612
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,719
instead what we would do is we would

1613
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,799
pick one point on the x-axis where we

1614
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,640
allocate some fraction of traffic to

1615
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,479
treatment and control and then we would

1616
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,719
compare the two points vertically along

1617
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:47,279
this line so we could run this 50 a b

1618
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,640
test and we could look at the difference

1619
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,479
between cap and control along this line

1620
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,000
as you can see from the graph this is

1621
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,600
just uh

1622
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,759
one point and it's a might be a biased

1623
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,120
estimate of the total treatment effect

1624
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,880
so here there's some bias and this can

1625
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,238
make our estimate of the total treatment

1626
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:07,718
correct incorrect

1627
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:12,080
so sort of the problem here is that

1628
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,158
we're just looking at one point

1629
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,600
and if we start looking at multiple

1630
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,799
points we can measure capping effects

1631
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,359
and compare this to the bias of ap tests

1632
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:22,640
so let's say we did the following let's

1633
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,799
say we could somehow run a five percent

1634
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:27,359
a b test and a 95 a b test

1635
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:28,960
simultaneously

1636
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,640
then we would get four points on this

1637
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,679
graph here

1638
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,839
and we could compare this like point on

1639
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,839
the far left over here when five percent

1640
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,719
of traffic is capped or 95 of traffic is

1641
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,640
not capped to this point over here on

1642
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,120
the right where 95 of traffic is capped

1643
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,960
so this is sort of when we're switching

1644
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,960
from most traffic not cap to most

1645
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,960
traffic capped and we can use this as an

1646
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,319
approximation of the total treatment

1647
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,359
effect

1648
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,479
and then we can compare that

1649
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,000
approximation to the results of these

1650
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
two a b tests and we could get an

1651
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,960
estimate of the bias

1652
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,159
so this is going to be our goal one

1653
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,400
thing that is tends to confuse people

1654
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,040
about this is why here are we picking a

1655
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,760
five percent and a 95 a b test

1656
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,920
instead of say a hundred percent and a

1657
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,760
zero percent because the total treatment

1658
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,280
effect is the difference between over

1659
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,960
here on the left 0

1660
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,320
and over here on the right 100

1661
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,679
the reason we're doing this here is

1662
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,440
because we're also really interested in

1663
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,679
measuring the bias of a b tests and if

1664
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,600
we were to pick this allocation of 100

1665
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,280
and zero percent we wouldn't have a b

1666
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,800
test to compare it to

1667
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,159
so this uh we thought was a nice

1668
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:33,760
compromise between coming up with an

1669
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,520
approximation of the overall effect of

1670
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,600
deploying bitrate counting and then also

1671
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,960
still having a b test that we could

1672
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,600
compare against

1673
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,440
so this is going to be our goal

1674
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,360
the real crux of measuring this though

1675
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,800
is going to be to run these two

1676
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,120
simultaneous experiments

1677
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,560
and the problem is like as soon as we

1678
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,080
start running this five percent test

1679
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,520
like it's going to be difficult to run a

1680
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,679
95 test because

1681
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,280
kind of we're allocating the same

1682
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,840
traffic

1683
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,080
so this is where we got extremely lucky

1684
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,360
and so

1685
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,800
netflix has this content delivery

1686
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,640
network called openconnect and

1687
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,480
openconnect has a bunch of servers

1688
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,480
located all around the world

1689
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,080
that connect with different isps

1690
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,640
we found this one location that had a

1691
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,040
pair of very reliably congested viewing

1692
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,679
links to the same isps

1693
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,600
so there's this isp there were these two

1694
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,120
links and then there were two routers

1695
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,719
and sets of servers that were connected

1696
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,280
to those routers

1697
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,199
these two links were very very similar

1698
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,920
so we had the same set of servers

1699
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,679
connected to the links the same routers

1700
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,640
here

1701
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,800
the same isp the same content was

1702
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,880
available on all of the servers

1703
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,239
and when we learned and looked at

1704
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,760
historical data we saw like no

1705
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,280
significant differences between the two

1706
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,560
links and most of the metrics that we

1707
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,560
cared about

1708
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,719
so these two links uh were

1709
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,480
both congested both pretty separate from

1710
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,320
each other and so what we could do is we

1711
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,560
could run one a b test here on these

1712
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,400
treatment servers and look at how it

1713
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,640
impacted the congestion on link one and

1714
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,000
then we could run a separate test on the

1715
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,679
control servers and look how it impacted

1716
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:06,560
the congestion on link two

1717
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,400
and so this is what we did we went on

1718
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,760
link one and we ran a test where

1719
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,040
ninety-five percent of traffic was

1720
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,960
capped and on link two we ran a test

1721
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,440
where five percent of traffic was kept

1722
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,679
this gave us those two experiments those

1723
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,120
four points from before and we could

1724
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,640
look at and compare the difference

1725
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,280
between these two things

1726
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,719
so now let me tell you about the results

1727
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,440
of the experiment

1728
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,320
so

1729
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,000
this is a similar graph to what we saw

1730
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
before on the x-axis is the fraction of

1731
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,640
traffic which is kept on the y-axis is a

1732
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,320
measure of normalized throughput in this

1733
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,840
experiment

1734
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,320
what we saw was in each a b test we saw

1735
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,239
about a five percent decrease in the

1736
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,080
throughput so capping decreased

1737
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,400
throughput by about five percent

1738
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,159
but overall when we compared these two

1739
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,600
treatments we saw an improvement of

1740
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,080
about 12 percent in throughput so when

1741
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,920
we switched most traffic from not cap to

1742
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,920
cat throughput went up by about 12

1743
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,679
so

1744
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,040
the important thing here is that the av

1745
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,560
tests are biased and they're not just

1746
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,320
sort of like kind of biased like even

1747
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,920
the direction of improvement is wrong

1748
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,400
so this is i think uh

1749
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,600
surprising

1750
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,840
and one thing that might make this a

1751
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,159
little bit clearer

1752
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,920
is if we look at the behavior of

1753
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,560
throughput as a time series

1754
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,320
so over here on the left is a time

1755
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,840
series of throughput before the

1756
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,960
experiment

1757
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,040
we've got two links and as you can see

1758
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,880
the two links have pretty much identical

1759
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,640
throughput over time

1760
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,360
over the course of the entire day

1761
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,199
during these peak hours which we shaded

1762
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:40,960
here these are the hours of the evening

1763
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,880
load increases

1764
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,560
at some point congestion sets in and

1765
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,000
when congestion sets in throughput

1766
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,080
decreases pretty significantly

1767
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,640
and then it goes back up to normal

1768
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,159
so during the experiment we again have

1769
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,159
these two links

1770
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:55,520
and this time the links are split

1771
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,080
between capped and uncapped traffic

1772
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,080
again we see during off-peak hours the

1773
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,560
links are both pretty similar but during

1774
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,080
peak hours we start to see a difference

1775
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,000
between these two links

1776
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,880
so these top two lines here this is uh

1777
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,960
the first link where 95 of traffic is

1778
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,960
kept and the bottom two are the other

1779
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,640
link where five percent of traffic is

1780
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,960
capped

1781
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:20,320
because we're doing capping here uh

1782
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,239
there's sort of less data that we're

1783
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:23,920
sending and in order for the link to be

1784
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,280
congested we're going to need higher

1785
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,080
load

1786
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,600
and that higher load will happen later

1787
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,760
in the day so when we cap we delay the

1788
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,520
onset of congestion for the link which

1789
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,000
is count and we also make congestion end

1790
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,040
earlier

1791
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,560
and so this means that between the two

1792
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,239
links the link which is mostly capped is

1793
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,239
going to have sort of less congestion

1794
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:42,719
and higher throughput

1795
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,440
but within each link within the a b test

1796
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,480
the traffic won't see any difference

1797
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,679
yeah and so there's no difference in

1798
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,120
throughput between the links but there

1799
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,640
is across the links and this is why the

1800
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,080
a b tests are not giving us accurate

1801
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,080
estimates

1802
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,640
so that was for throughput we also saw

1803
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,400
this behavior for a couple other metrics

1804
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,080
that we were interested in one was round

1805
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,760
trip time and the other one was play

1806
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,360
delay or sort of how long it takes for

1807
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,280
the video to start up

1808
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,719
in all of these cases we saw

1809
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,000
improvements in the total treatment

1810
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,840
effect like capping improved these

1811
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,320
metrics but the a b tests sort of didn't

1812
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,840
even get the direction of improvement

1813
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,760
wrong they either reported that the

1814
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,280
metric would get worse or that the

1815
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,640
metric was not affected by the treatment

1816
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,480
and the the a b test was like extremely

1817
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,920
confident about this like you know you

1818
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,840
compute the 95 confidence intervals

1819
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,840
they're very confident that it's 5 to 15

1820
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,480
worse in an a b test when really it's 25

1821
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,480
better

1822
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,440
so what this experiment shows is that a

1823
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,880
b tests are biased when they're running

1824
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,400
congested networks

1825
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,159
and this to us was pretty concerning

1826
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:50,080
because we use a b test really heavily

1827
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,480
to evaluate new algorithms and if

1828
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,679
they're

1829
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,080
not giving us even the right direction

1830
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,760
in some cases

1831
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,440
we're worried about this decisions we

1832
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,120
might make as a result of these tests

1833
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,400
so let me be a little bit more specific

1834
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,239
about these risks here

1835
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:09,920
here's a pretty common development

1836
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,840
process you might use if you're using a

1837
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,000
b tests it's pretty similar to the

1838
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,440
process that the team we work with

1839
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,679
pretty closely at netflix is using

1840
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,199
so maybe you'll come up with some idea

1841
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,440
you'll implement that idea you'll run an

1842
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,040
a b test for that idea and you'll get a

1843
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,360
sense of how the idea performs and then

1844
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,640
you'll iterate these steps one through

1845
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,679
three until you'll come up with

1846
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:28,880
something that works pretty well and

1847
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,159
then you'll go and you'll deploy that

1848
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,480
idea

1849
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,480
so the risks here is that when you run

1850
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,239
an a b test you don't get an accurate

1851
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:37,760
estimate of what happens when you deploy

1852
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,159
the idea and this can have a couple of

1853
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,000
different consequences

1854
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,679
within the development process it means

1855
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,679
you could give up too early on an idea

1856
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:47,040
that's good that would work well in

1857
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,719
production just because you don't see it

1858
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,040
work as well in the a b test

1859
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,400
or you could continue on with an

1860
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,159
approach that doesn't work like when you

1861
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,080
go and you deploy it but seems to work

1862
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,480
well in the a b test

1863
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,440
when you finally deploy the thing

1864
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,719
you could deploy something that doesn't

1865
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,400
work as expected and in the worst case

1866
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,000
this could cause a production impacting

1867
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,239
issue or in probably a more typical case

1868
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:09,360
you might just have to go through this

1869
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,120
process many more times

1870
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,920
and improve the algorithm

1871
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,239
so so those are the risks but another

1872
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:19,679
thing we saw is that we can run

1873
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,360
experiments that help reduce and remove

1874
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,640
this bias

1875
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,480
so this perdlink experiment we described

1876
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,400
is just one example and there are other

1877
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,920
sorts of experiments you can use that

1878
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,840
are also less impacted by bias so i'd

1879
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,960
like to tell you about two of these

1880
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,520
experiments

1881
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,199
the first kind of experiment design is

1882
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:36,800
called an event study

1883
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,960
in an event study you have some event

1884
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,400
and then you compare what happens after

1885
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,920
the event to what happens before the

1886
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:42,800
event

1887
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,120
so in this case on the right we can look

1888
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,199
at bitrate capping the event here is

1889
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:50,159
going to be sort of switching to 95 bit

1890
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,600
rate capping

1891
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,000
and we're gonna do that say right here

1892
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,280
on friday

1893
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,719
so what we would do we would switch on

1894
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,960
friday to 95 capping and then we would

1895
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,600
compare after and before

1896
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,040
this would give us an estimate of the

1897
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,719
total treatment effect

1898
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:07,040
and if we switch from say five percent

1899
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,520
capping to 95 capping we can also

1900
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,199
compare this to the results of the b

1901
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,640
test and get a sense of whether or not

1902
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,520
the a b test was biased

1903
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,960
another good thing about this sort of

1904
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,040
experiment design is it's

1905
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,719
pretty common folks might already be

1906
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,880
doing this when they deploy things so if

1907
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,400
you go and you deploy a new feature it's

1908
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,239
pretty common to look at the metrics

1909
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,159
before and after the deployment and see

1910
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:30,159
how it the deployment impacted those

1911
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:31,840
metrics

1912
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,520
when you do this you can compare those

1913
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,280
metrics to the a b test and you can

1914
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,960
start to build up some intuition about

1915
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,719
whether particular changes are impacted

1916
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,840
by congestion interference

1917
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,239
the big problem with event studies is an

1918
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,239
issue called seasonality and this is

1919
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:48,159
basically so you look after some event

1920
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,320
and compare it to before that event but

1921
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,920
there might be other events that happen

1922
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,360
around the same time and you're not

1923
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,880
going to be able to rule out things that

1924
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,880
were caused by that event

1925
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,560
so in this particular experiment

1926
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,520
one event here is that we're switching

1927
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,199
to capping and another event is that

1928
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,880
it's suddenly the weekend

1929
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,080
and so we're not going to be able to

1930
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,679
disentangle here the difference between

1931
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,199
things that are caused by the weekend

1932
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,559
and things that are caused by capping

1933
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,239
one way we can deal with this is with a

1934
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,239
switchback experiment this is another

1935
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,080
sort of experiment design where instead

1936
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,800
of just switching once we switch back

1937
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,880
and forth between treatment and control

1938
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,960
so maybe on this day we use capping on

1939
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,800
the second day we use

1940
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,320
no capping and then we switch back and

1941
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,639
forth

1942
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,159
we compare all the days where we're

1943
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,440
capping to all the days where we're not

1944
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,960
capping and we use this to estimate the

1945
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,360
total treatment effect

1946
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,440
um so again this gives us an estimate of

1947
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,120
the total treatment effect

1948
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,800
and this is going to be more robust to

1949
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,719
seasonality issues because sort of in

1950
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,560
order to get the bias here from other

1951
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,560
events those events need to line up with

1952
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,159
most of the switches throughout the

1953
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,360
experiment

1954
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,360
and especially if you randomize the days

1955
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,880
on which you are using treatment or

1956
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,640
using control this can help avoid these

1957
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,640
issues

1958
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,159
the major con here is a carryover effect

1959
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,400
and this is when sort of the fact that

1960
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,639
i'm doing capping towards the end of

1961
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:13,679
thursday

1962
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:15,920
is going to change the initial

1963
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,040
conditions that you see on friday

1964
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,600
and then maybe the whole path of the

1965
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,719
friday

1966
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,080
say throughput in this case is going to

1967
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,199
be different than you would see with

1968
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,440
control

1969
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,960
so this is um

1970
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,159
this is certainly a risk but it's sort

1971
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,000
of a risk that depends on your system

1972
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,280
and if you're running experiments i

1973
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,800
think you may be pretty familiar with

1974
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,280
like the carry over the sort of behavior

1975
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,199
the way your system changes over time

1976
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,639
and you can design this experiment

1977
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:43,199
accordingly

1978
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,440
so those are just two sort of experiment

1979
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,840
designs you can use to avoid some of the

1980
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,080
impacts of congestion interference

1981
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,080
and so i'd like to conclude and say

1982
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,800
there's a lot more that we can do here

1983
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,560
so i think what our work showed is that

1984
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,400
if you have an a b test and this a b

1985
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,800
test uses a congested network this a b

1986
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,360
test has the possibility of being biased

1987
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,280
there's this pathway for treatment and

1988
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,679
control to interfere with each other via

1989
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:13,120
the use of their shared links

1990
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,920
what we don't know is sort of how much

1991
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,960
this bias matters

1992
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,280
we don't know if the bias is going to be

1993
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,040
a small fraction or a large fraction

1994
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,400
especially in experiments that you might

1995
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,239
be running like we know what it is for

1996
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:27,920
this one particular experiment but we

1997
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,040
don't know what it is for all

1998
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,880
experiments and so we would encourage

1999
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,560
you to go and run some measurements if

2000
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,480
you are running experiments to see if

2001
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,000
this kind of interference matters for

2002
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,400
your experiments

2003
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,840
and i think personally one thing i would

2004
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,360
really love to see is new papers and new

2005
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,560
proposals

2006
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,000
talking about total treatment effects

2007
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,080
and sort of reporting the results for

2008
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,360
instance when they go and they deploy

2009
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,040
the algorithm

2010
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,400
instead of just the results of a small

2011
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,280
scale a b test

2012
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,800
i think mainly what this work highlights

2013
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,000
is that we have a need for better

2014
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,639
experiment methodology for networks

2015
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:02,880
so

2016
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,840
our the experiments we've proposed are

2017
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,400
just a couple of different ways that you

2018
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,239
could hope to run experiments to measure

2019
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:12,159
the total treatment effects

2020
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:13,600
and to be honest their experiments we

2021
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,679
took pretty much

2022
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,600
without much modification

2023
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,280
from causal inference work and other

2024
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,280
experiment literature

2025
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,719
i personally think that if we were to

2026
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,320
sit down and design experiments for

2027
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,480
networking algorithms using what we know

2028
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,920
about networks we could probably come up

2029
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,080
with more sophisticated experiments that

2030
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,840
could give us better results and like

2031
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,600
more confidence and better estimates of

2032
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,840
the total treatment effects

2033
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,199
and personally i'm really excited to see

2034
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,120
the kind of algorithms we could build

2035
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,400
the kind of results we could get by

2036
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,920
using these experiments

2037
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,480
so thanks

2038
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,480
okay

2039
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,760
thank you

2040
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,040
uh excellent talk

2041
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,880
um does anyone have any questions

2042
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,280
uh janna

2043
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,239
i think i'm

2044
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:09,520
in okay

2045
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,440
um

2046
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,600
thank you bruce that was a great talk

2047
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,320
and good work and hi by the way it's uh

2048
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,520
good to see you

2049
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,040
presenting

2050
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,639
at the irtf

2051
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,760
i will say that uh

2052
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,800
this is very very eliminating um

2053
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,920
at a minimum

2054
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,080
i think it's it's it's something that as

2055
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,600
you say everybody should take into

2056
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,159
account when doing these experiments and

2057
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:35,360
it's

2058
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,880
great to have

2059
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,080
the data to back it up and to argue that

2060
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,320
simple small a b tests which i've relied

2061
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,679
on for a long time

2062
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,159
aren't necessarily good enough

2063
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,000
but i was going to poke a little bit

2064
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,360
more at the thing that you just said

2065
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,120
which is the

2066
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,320
um

2067
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,480
the the uh

2068
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,679
dominance of the bias that you see there

2069
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:59,840
um

2070
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,280
in particular one thing that occurs to

2071
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,600
me is uh i don't know if you've looked

2072
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,760
into seeing if you made like for example

2073
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,560
a client sticky

2074
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,320
for a particular

2075
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,520
a b test

2076
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,440
as against i don't know how exactly i

2077
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,520
haven't read the paper in detail but how

2078
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,960
exactly the uh choice was made for

2079
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,360
serving particular type of content but i

2080
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,120
imagine that

2081
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,159
i guess where i'm coming from is that

2082
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,760
the it depends on whether bottleneck

2083
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,960
really lies

2084
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,880
if the bottleneck is a shed the bottling

2085
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,080
has to be a shared bottle like in this

2086
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,320
particular case for the the control in

2087
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,040
the

2088
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,480
experiment groups

2089
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,480
and if as is commonly the case the

2090
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,400
bottleneck is closer to the

2091
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,480
user and not like it appeared appearing

2092
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,719
link or some other place

2093
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,400
then in that particular case i imagine

2094
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,120
that if the user is in a bucket that is

2095
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,800
either control

2096
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,560
or

2097
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,600
treatment

2098
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,880
then

2099
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,440
the user would basically effectively be

2100
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,920
at the far end of your of your scale

2101
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:58,800
right like

2102
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,639
for you by seeing that effect

2103
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:02,880
um have you looked into that have you

2104
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:06,000
were your experiments sticky to users

2105
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,920
yeah so this is a good point that um

2106
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,040
there are things you can do on the

2107
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,960
allocation side to kind of avoid some of

2108
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,120
these issues so the experiments we ran

2109
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,360
were sticky to users um

2110
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,040
although it's a little bit tricky

2111
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,880
because it's like the users that are

2112
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,679
going over these two different paths

2113
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:22,480
um

2114
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,320
but the the sort of overall point you're

2115
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,480
making is is true that like if you um

2116
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,120
sort of can guarantee that the users are

2117
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,800
not going to share any resources with

2118
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,560
each other over the whole way then

2119
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,840
you're going to be able to avoid this

2120
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,120
bias

2121
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,800
because there's no pathway for them to

2122
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,400
interfere with each other

2123
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,840
and if you sort of believe that all of

2124
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,760
the users are not sharing any of their

2125
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,440
bottleneck links with each other then

2126
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,800
you've sort of avoided some of the

2127
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,120
possibility for bias

2128
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,719
we didn't explore this too much because

2129
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,000
we found it pretty hard to measure

2130
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,880
whether or not users were sharing

2131
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,320
links and we didn't have a good sense of

2132
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,040
like how often this was

2133
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,239
um

2134
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,239
but i guess okay so if you were to

2135
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,639
allocate users instead of sessions my

2136
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,400
gut instinct would be that this is an

2137
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,840
improvement over just allocating

2138
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,159
sessions in terms of interference

2139
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,520
another thing you could do is you could

2140
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,520
allocate networks

2141
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,960
or

2142
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,880
particular servers or

2143
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,560
sort of try and reduce the probability

2144
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,159
that there is sort of treatment control

2145
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,960
sharing the same link and if you do this

2146
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,639
i think this will reduce the bias that

2147
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:27,679
you would see in the experiment

2148
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,639
yeah that's very helpful um i was asking

2149
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:32,000
this because if you actually did the

2150
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,199
experiment

2151
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:37,520
by trying to if we try to uh

2152
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,960
it could tell you something about where

2153
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,440
users end up sharing bottlenecks as well

2154
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,120
if you actually try to do it the way

2155
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,480
that you are suggesting any of these

2156
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,480
ways

2157
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,480
those ought to make things better when

2158
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,239
the bottleneck is closer to the user

2159
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,159
versus not

2160
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,040
and those experiments can actually shed

2161
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,840
some pretty interesting light on exactly

2162
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,600
where bottlenecks are

2163
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,880
on the internet

2164
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,000
yeah absolutely

2165
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,400
you again

2166
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,120
uh thank you jenna uh brian do you have

2167
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,320
a question

2168
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,719
is this

2169
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,400
hi brian trammell not speaking as um

2170
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,320
sort of i guess a

2171
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,760
solar flare backup chair um

2172
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,520
so there was something that you said

2173
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,000
earlier that that was i think kind of

2174
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,600
fundamental and really interesting that

2175
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,440
i want to repeat back if we use what we

2176
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,400
know

2177
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,320
about networks to design experiments

2178
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,840
about networks we can get you know we

2179
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,679
can get a lot smarter about this

2180
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,120
and then i was looking at the graph that

2181
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,520
you had of the switchback experiment and

2182
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,920
what it what that

2183
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,280
reminded me of more than nothing else

2184
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,960
was like a diagram of time division

2185
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,960
multiple access from sort of like a

2186
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,880
physical layer textbook that i looked at

2187
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,320
in college right

2188
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,600
so a b tests are basically code division

2189
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,840
partition of the space

2190
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,000
switchbacks are time division partition

2191
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,600
of the space

2192
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,960
like all of the stuff that john was

2193
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,639
talking about were other sort of ways to

2194
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,480
split the space with different sorts of

2195
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,159
ways to code it

2196
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,840
are there other

2197
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,280
bits like

2198
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,480
ways to use this multiple access

2199
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,560
metaphor to find other ways to split the

2200
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,960
space in order to figure out

2201
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:29,760
like

2202
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,360
how to split this apart because like my

2203
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,520
sre mind basically wants to say well we

2204
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,719
could basically automate this code

2205
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:35,920
partition in a whole bunch of different

2206
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,679
ways and then you know watch which

2207
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,120
things show up in the power spectrum

2208
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,800
which things get amplified out of that

2209
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,239
but i'm wondering if there's a more

2210
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:43,679
fundamental way that you could split

2211
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,320
this up in order to be able to

2212
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,760
i'm not expecting an answer to that

2213
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,400
question right now um but

2214
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,800
um if you have one it'd be great but

2215
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,600
yeah

2216
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,239
it's a super interesting question i

2217
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:58,400
don't have an answer up hand but it's

2218
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,760
yeah it's really interesting to think i

2219
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,199
would be interested in following up with

2220
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:02,400
you on an answer to that question

2221
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,520
because i think there's something like

2222
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,280
really kind of deep there

2223
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,880
yeah i'm happy to chat about it

2224
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:07,920
definitely

2225
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,400
um i can share a little bit about other

2226
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,760
experiments that people run and maybe

2227
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,280
this will be interesting

2228
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,280
um so one thing people do in social

2229
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,360
networks that i think is pretty cool

2230
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,120
is you would um

2231
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,120
sort of allocate a user and then all of

2232
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,040
a friends users to a particular

2233
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,560
treatment and you sort of think about

2234
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,920
this graph structure and how you can

2235
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,520
allocate based on this graph structure

2236
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,080
in order to get optimal behavior

2237
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,280
and so maybe there's something cool we

2238
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:35,080
could do with that for networks

2239
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,600
yeah

2240
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,480
uh try something

2241
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:45,760
uh yes this is jonathan morton

2242
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,840
and um

2243
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,760
i think the one of the big lessons to

2244
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,480
take away from this is how important it

2245
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,360
is

2246
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,239
to

2247
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:57,199
understand the

2248
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:02,080
uh the testing methodology in detail

2249
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:07,440
when we look at a set of um of purported

2250
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,920
results particularly ones that are used

2251
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,639
for marketing

2252
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,800
so the

2253
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,440
fine details of the testing methodology

2254
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,320
can have a big effect such as exactly

2255
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,719
how this a b test

2256
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:24,639
may have been done

2257
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,560
and whether the uh

2258
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,239
the potential bias that you've just

2259
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:29,679
highlighted

2260
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:30,719
um

2261
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:35,000
has been mitigated in any way

2262
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:41,000
yeah definitely

2263
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,760
okay uh apparently there may be problems

2264
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,600
in the room but hopefully you can still

2265
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,360
hear us if not see that

2266
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,880
you can still hear us okay good good

2267
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,480
okay um

2268
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,719
so i guess um

2269
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:09,040
i guess uh i it's the same sort of

2270
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,880
question i used to send you to earlier

2271
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,639
which is uh you know obviously you're

2272
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:15,040
talking to the the ie etf

2273
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,239
and and the irtf um and you said there

2274
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:21,040
was a need for for better experiment

2275
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,280
methodology

2276
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,599
um

2277
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,199
what it what if anything should we be

2278
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,600
doing um

2279
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,600
when we're designing protocols

2280
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,440
evaluating protocols

2281
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:37,040
to to

2282
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,719
to make sure the evaluations and the

2283
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,960
critical designs are right

2284
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,400
is there some sort of general guidance

2285
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,320
we should be providing or is it

2286
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,760
read this paper and think about these

2287
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,600
issues

2288
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,199
i guess uh

2289
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:54,560
overall what i would say is

2290
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,000
i think all the stuff we're doing today

2291
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,840
is good and we know it's good because we

2292
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,159
like we build good systems with the the

2293
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,080
stuff we do today and i think what this

2294
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,840
gives us is like another tool to think

2295
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,000
about how the algorithms work and try to

2296
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,760
measure like the way these algorithms

2297
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,800
work

2298
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,360
and so i guess kind of when designing

2299
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,360
new algorithms like in the itf i would

2300
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,960
think about like

2301
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,280
um the way the experiments we run to

2302
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,960
validate those algorithms can be biased

2303
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,159
and then i would try to think about

2304
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:21,600
other ways of running experiments that

2305
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,239
might reduce that bias

2306
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:32,960
yeah okay that makes sense make sense

2307
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,080
all right are there any other questions

2308
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,280
for

2309
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,440
the speaker

2310
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,920
okay uh i guess not so in that case

2311
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,199
thank you

2312
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:56,870
uh bruce thank you

2313
01:32:56,870 --> 01:33:01,920
[Applause]

2314
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,560
uh and uh again thank you to to both of

2315
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,360
you and congratulations on on the awards

2316
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,560
um i

2317
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,360
i

2318
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,080
do do wish uh

2319
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,320
we could present these in person but uh

2320
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,400
i'm sure we'll uh

2321
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,719
find ways of of getting the awards to

2322
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:19,920
you

2323
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,440
um

2324
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,280
uh i'm also sure that uh if people have

2325
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,760
any any further questions uh both sim

2326
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,480
peter and bruce will be happy to answer

2327
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,800
them and to discuss the work further

2328
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,719
uh so again uh

2329
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:35,679
congratulations to both of you

2330
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:38,639
um we have a few minutes left in the

2331
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:41,840
session um if there's any um other

2332
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,600
questions or if anything people want to

2333
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,760
discuss uh i guess we have time for any

2334
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,679
other business um

2335
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:49,520
but uh other than that uh i think we're

2336
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,520
at the the end of the published agenda

2337
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,639
so there's anything else people want to

2338
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:01,239
raise do you join the queue

2339
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,560
going once

2340
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:13,360
okay in that case i guess you all get 20

2341
