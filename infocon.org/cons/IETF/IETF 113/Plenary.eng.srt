thank you

11
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,760
looks like

12
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,519
it

13
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,000
is the mic on its own uh please please

14
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
come in and take a seat and the mic is

15
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
really on

16
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,280
uh welcome everybody um

17
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,440
woo yeah my name is liz eckhart i

18
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,160
chaired the ihf since a year ago

19
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
it's very very nice to see all of you

20
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,919
here in person it really feels like an

21
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,680
itf meeting although

22
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
as you probably can realize we're not

23
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,479
quite at the usual bench things but um

24
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,240
it does feel really good it really feels

25
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,919
like it's been a long time it's been way

26
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,320
too long and

27
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
i also hope the remote participants will

28
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
have a chance to join us again at some

29
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,360
time in the future

30
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,759
hopefully in philadelphia or in london

31
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,600
later in the year or at any other time

32
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,479
and

33
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,639
we're also hoping that the improvements

34
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,680
we made

35
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,040
to the tooling for remote participation

36
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,280
because of corona will have a lasting

37
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,759
impact uh that will

38
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,000
open up the organization to more

39
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
participants

40
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,520
in into the future

41
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,919
because i really think um

42
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,000
we're not gonna go back to the old style

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,639
meeting for a while

44
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
um

45
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
and it's also so it's exciting to be

46
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,360
here in person

47
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,639
it's also quite sad and i'm pretty

48
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,280
emotional about this so i'm struggling a

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
little bit here but you know it's been

50
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,000
sad because obviously because of covet

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,080
we haven't really been able to meet um

52
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,520
for a long time

53
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,960
and some people had some extremely

54
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,199
challenging years

55
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,440
um and it remains an ongoing concern for

56
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,840
many of

57
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,199
us um

58
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,320
but also walking around the city right

59
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,240
you can't miss the signs that a war is

60
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
going on

61
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
right now

62
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,680
and it's a tragedy

63
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,160
and the war in ukraine feels very

64
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,919
personal because

65
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,199
we know that some of our friends and

66
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,039
families and colleagues are directly

67
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,520
affected

68
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,600
and the personal safety and security is

69
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
at stake

70
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,199
and their lives are in peril

71
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,080
so we worry about the safety

72
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
of our ukrainian colleagues

73
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,639
and their families

74
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,600
and

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,039
being so directly impacted

76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,199
makes it difficult to concentrate

77
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,600
on the work of the itf which is

78
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,960
making the internet work better

79
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,160
and

80
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,960
i personally sort of

81
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,319
believe the inner is fundamentally about

82
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,000
connecting people

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,199
and

84
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,199
i can take some little bit of comfort

85
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,800
because

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,639
i choose to believe that

87
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,919
doing so

88
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,680
will hopefully allow us in the future to

89
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,720
avoid

90
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,039
needless wars

91
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,199
thank you

92
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
that said um

93
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,240
some things never change and you can

94
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,080
take a great comfort that the

95
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,720
note well slide remains

96
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
as unreadable

97
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,039
as it has been

98
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,280
for decades now so

99
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,360
if you're new to the organization this

100
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,880
is

101
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,520
what we require of you as participants

102
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,919
please try and read it it's not very

103
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,160
easy but um you should be familiar with

104
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
it by now

105
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,479
there are some tips on how to

106
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,960
participate here

107
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
um when you join me echo which is the

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,960
tool we're using for displenary

109
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
your audio will be muted your video will

110
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,039
be off

111
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,960
and when you like to speak from the

112
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,479
floor or

113
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,720
i guess up on stage um

114
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
please unmute yourself

115
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
um

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,039
when you are recognized in the queue

117
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,720
and we ask you to share your video if

118
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,240
you feel comfortable doing so because it

119
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,039
makes it a bit more personal

120
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,800
and if you have a headset please use it

121
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,199
it makes a big difference

122
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,879
and there's a lot of other helpful tips

123
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,199
that you can follow if you choose to do

124
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,910
so

125
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,360

227
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
dummy i'm not trusted with the real one

228
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,279
because apparently i might drop it

229
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,880
um

230
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,399

happen um

235
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,760
i said it feels like an itf meeting and

236
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,360
it kind of is except for the mask and

237
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
some of these other you know corona

238
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,360
specified things but

239
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
secretariat has done an heroic job to

240
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,720
pull this together and the corona

241
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
restrictions in austria were

242
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
quite a bit more strict until very

243
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,959
recently and so all the planning went

244
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,200
towards that much more strict type of

245
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,160
meeting

246
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
which was um even more work than what we

247
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,920
have now so thank you very much the

248
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
secretary of meet echo the knock

249
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,399
all of which

250
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,160
handled the relocation which happened

251
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,040
really late in the cycle from bangkok to

252
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,399
vienna very well

253
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
um the llc did a good job the tool seam

254
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,639
is always at the hackathon to port great

255
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,360
job thank you

256
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:02,480
[Applause]

257
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
which brings me to the boring part which

258
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,480
is the chair report

259
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,639
participant statistics and a few other

260
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,079
of the usual suspects we're going to go

261
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,519
through very quickly so we have time for

262
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,279
open mic

263
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,279
we did see an uptick in registration

264
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,279
numbers we are

265
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,120
just under 1400

266
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,399
total just over 300 onsite in 1100

267
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,480
remote which is

268
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,000
about in line with the regular

269
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,480
quote-unquote european meeting um so we

270
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,399
did see a significant uptick in the last

271
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,519
two weeks to normal numbers

272
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,000
we used almost 250 fee waivers which is

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,040
great

274
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,399
allows people that otherwise couldn't

275
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,079
afford to participate to participate

276
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,440
remotely

277
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
we're going to continue the free waiver

278
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,880
program

279
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
into the future so there will always be

280
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,800
a free

281
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
remote participation option at itfs

282
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,000
now we have 231 hackathon registrations

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,519
which considering

284
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,199
um you know

285
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,920
134 of those were online so a lot more

286
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,120
of the online people actually rented a

287
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,600
hackathon for 50

288
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,760
uh roughly it's great um and we had a

289
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,839
lot of people participating remotely

290
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,920
statistics by country i think this is

291
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,600
for the total

292
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,079
number of participants you can see it's

293
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,399
the usual split more or less and i think

294
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,680
i have an extra slide that i haven't

295
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
seen yet

296
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
on this breakdown between on-site and

297
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
remote

298
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,279
so

299
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,639
join me looking at this light for the

300
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,959
first time

301
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,519
we have uh as i said 300 people on site

302
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,839
and about 1100 remote

303
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,680
and the breakdown glancing from up here

304
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,360
looks pretty much identical so i don't

305
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
know what we learned from that but

306
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,279
apparently the

307
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,040
kobe did not keep uh some regions of the

308
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,800
world further away than others so that's

309
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,839
i guess good um but

310
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,440
okay i'm getting corrected from the

311
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
floor

312
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,800
the colors are different okay

313
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,880
well since i can't read the font um

314
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,279
do do what you will with that

315
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,279
information so i guess we will

316
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,760
i will stop analyzing things i can't

317
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,279
read

318
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,040
but you can look at these uh in the

319
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,439
minutes

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,800
right future meetings um

321
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,399
we have a bunch of different ways we

322
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,920
have a for a while now i had to support

323
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
that itf.org email address which is your

324
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,240
one stop shop for anything goes into the

325
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,839
ticket system and you get directed to

326
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,079
the right person for your request

327
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,920
if you have something urgent about the

328
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,519
meeting or something else

329
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,360
it's typically a good idea to email that

330
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,519
rather than some random analyst where

331
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,600
the secretariat is not hanging out to

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,320
handle your requests immediately

333
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
for tools specifically it's also a good

334
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,000
idea to email tools discuss

335
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,560
jay is about to send out the post 113

336
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,120
survey which has a bunch of

337
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,639
new questions because it's our first

338
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,920
hybrid meeting

339
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,440
and we do want to know how that worked

340
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
for you especially those of you who are

341
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,680
here

342
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,279
but also those of you who are using the

343
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,480
remote tooling for the first time

344
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,800
and we have the shmu working group

345
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,240
that is still meeting as far as i

346
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,440
remember

347
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,920
which is our general gender era group

348
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,440
that talks about

349
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,079
meeting related

350
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,199
things right um

351
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,480
we have a few things that are

352
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
experiments

353
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,959
or

354
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,360
planned actions

355
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,519
we have an ongoing

356
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,320
comment period on the proposal to

357
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,839
archive

358
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,639
discussions between document authors

359
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,759
and the rpc during world 48

360
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,600
i think it runs until tomorrow so if you

361
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,440
have strong feelings we have a day to

362
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,519
send them

363
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,360
we are constantly

364
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
tweaking the way we review buffs

365
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
proposals for new work

366
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
because they're important

367
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,519
um

368
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,720
scheduling

369
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
when you need to submit them by how

370
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
we're viewing them so we can give you

371
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,199
feedback we're also

372
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,679
looking at running

373
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,480
more

374
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,280
virtual slash interim buffs and these

375
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,640
are not necessarily new because we've

376
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,160
had them but very rarely in the past and

377
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
we recently decided there's specifically

378
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,359
because of the band that make really no

379
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,959
reason to try and have more of those it

380
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,160
seems silly

381
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,919
that proponents of an idea have to work

382
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,000
until the next meeting just to have a

383
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,919
session

384
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,919
um and we

385
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,280
discussed that we're going to create

386
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
this important news announcement list

387
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
which is going to be very low volume

388
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,720
but we'll also go to everybody with a

389
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,320
datatracker account because we need a

390
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,240
way to communicate with you guys

391
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,320
right um we had zero appeals since the

392
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,919
last itf so

393
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,640
thank you for that

394
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,440
um and we we made did one statement on

395
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,000
how you should as an author

396
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,559
understand when you get isg ballot

397
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,360
position emails and i think the short

398
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
version is don't freak out

399
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,200
it's not as bad as you think it is

400
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,559
there's a lot more written reports

401
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,160
including ours

402
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
at the url there that you can look at

403
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,240
there's also the idf blog

404
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
that sort of gets fresh content every

405
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,000
once in a while

406
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,280
that's also worth checking out

407
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,760
and now i'd like to hand over to robert

408
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,679
from the tools team

409
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,039
and i can

410
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,160
try to give you control

411
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,720
except i can't

412
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
testing testing

413
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
i can hear you i'm just trying to make

414
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,280
you

415
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,600
able to drive the slides how's this

416
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,679
it looks like it's updating

417
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,919
all right should be able to drive

418
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,960
so hello everyone i'll see if my next

419
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,000
slide

420
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,480
yes as lars mentioned there has been a

421
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,039
lot of activity around

422
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,760
the repositories for the tools that we

423
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,720
use

424
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,080
at the ietf we are completing a project

425
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,080
to move um the largest ones to github

426
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,919
these are on the slide

427
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,640
these are three of nearly 50

428
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,280
repositories that are available in the

429
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,039
ietf tools organization at github

430
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,679
i encourage everyone to go explore all

431
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,000
of them

432
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,240
now that we're at github

433
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,280
we're asking that people use it for

434
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,600
bug reports and feature requests using

435
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,559
the issues and discussion um mechanisms

436
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,400
that are at github

437
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,559
and you can also send email to

438
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,160
toolsdiscuss at ietf.org which is a

439
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,400
backstop for people that have any

440
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,039
any difficulties um using github for

441
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,520
whatever reason

442
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,600
please take a moment when you can to

443
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,760
read the contributing

444
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,159
document that i've got

445
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,960
on the slide you can find it um

446
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,280
linked from the readme from each of the

447
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,880
repositories

448
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
that'll give you a good overview of of

449
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,120
how you can engage if you want to to

450
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,840
work on the code beyond providing bug

451
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
reports and feature requests and

452
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,080
engaging in the discussions and join our

453
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,400
code sprints when you can

454
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,840
watch the tools discuss list for um

455
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,200
when these when these are going to occur

456

tools discuss list is also disqus list

458
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,320
is also a good place to

459
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,400
send code contributions if for some

460
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
reason you have no no

461
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,039
ability to to push things directly to

462
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,080
github

463
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,159
um i'll always be willing to take

464
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,640
patches directly and manipulate things

465
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,640
into the repositories on your behalf

466
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,880
the tools team meets regularly you can

467
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,559
watch further meetings in the upcoming

468
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,280
meetings calendar and we have a set of

469
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,600
workshops that are are that we're

470
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
working on scheduling you can look in

471
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,679
that repository to find out what they're

472
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,840
about

473
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,320
i also wanted to point to a new set of

474
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,559
resources that are available to us at

475
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,000
authors.ietf.org there are

476
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,559
tools up there that describe how to

477
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,520
author how to convert things from

478
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,320
provide tools for converting things from

479
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,799
the authoring formats into the various

480
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,240
rendering formats and doing guests

481
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,559
um we'll also have a bib xml service up

482
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,120
there very soon

483
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,760
um the last comment that i'd like to

484
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,640
make is

485
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,280
look at the discussion on tools discuss

486
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,480
about the work that we're doing on the

487
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,880
way the data tracker looks we're

488
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,320
currently moving very quickly towards a

489
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,480
major update to the look and feel of the

490
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,840
data tracker

491
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,280
you can find information on the tools

492
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
discussed list about how to see what

493
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,679
that's going to look like and help us

494
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,000
find any issues in it before it becomes

495
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,640
production if you if you have the time

496
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,000
to contribute

497
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,080
thank you

498
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,520
thanks robert and i think i remember

499
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,840
that the author tools idf drug wallet is

500
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,120
working for many people already it's

501
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,280
still considered better and so you if

502
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,440
you find issues please report them

503
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,120
it's much better than the old tool that

504
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,360
we had already but i think there's still

505
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,400
some things that are still being

506
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,159
improved so thanks for that

507
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
and i think next i'm going to hand over

508
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,919
to miriah who gives the iab report

509
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,600
and do i need to take back control here

510
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,399

511
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,039

514
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,440

515
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
two years and this is my first time i'm

516
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,080
standing here so very exciting

517
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,320
um hopefully next time we will see even

518
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
more faces in person again we're excited

519
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,320

520
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,000
and we're excited to be here to work

521
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,760
together with all of you

522
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,720

for a plenary for us but quite late for

524
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,080
a lot of people online again i will be

525
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,760
trying to be very quick i only have a

526
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,400
few slides

527
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,640
my first slide is as usually all the

528
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,000
other information that i don't tell you

529
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,400
here today are in the report so you can

530
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,240
pick them from the proceedings and read

531
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,760
them yourself

532
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,919
um and i'm only reporting a little bit

533
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,080
here on like the important admin stuff

534
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,360
but if you're actually interested what

535
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,799
the iab is doing otherwise and

536
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,080
interested in engaging with some

537
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
technical and technical discussion with

538
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,320
the iab we have the iab open session

539
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,159
tomorrow so there will be a little bit

540
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,080
more reporting tomorrow about what we

541
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,159
actually do and there will be a

542
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,000
discussion about centralization or

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,559
actually how to encounter centralization

544
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,320
and tomorrow so it would be great to see

545
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,760
you all there

546
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,960
maybe not all of you because it's a

547
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,320
smaller room but many of you

548
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,080
oh oh sorry now i skipped some slides

549
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,039
yeah i slipped and skipped this

550
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,960
important slide so one of the big

551
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,039
announcements today is that we have a

552
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,679
new independent submission editor um the

553
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,480
iab recently appointed elliott lear

554
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,120
to um take over this position

555
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,520
unfortunately he is not here today um

556
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,600
but i'm sure you maybe had a chance to

557
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
meet him online there were office hours

558
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,960
and hopefully we will see him next time

559
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
again and like he's pretty well known to

560
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,039
many of you i think otherwise all i can

561
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,559
give you at this point is this photo

562
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,840
here

563
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,600
um and i would also like to take the

564
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
opportunity to say thank you to adrian

565
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,679
again and i already announced last time

566
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,240
that he decided to step down after um

567
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,640
four years and so this transition had

568
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
just happened recently he already

569
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
stepped down he's unfortunately also not

570
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,880
here so like again no chance to have a

571
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
nice dinner with him and but we will

572
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,400
ship him some chocolate from here

573
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,000
so we got we got this extra large box

574
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,400
for you adrian

575
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,400
okay one more thing i would like to take

576
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,919
a few minutes for

577
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,679
um is to announce the outcome of the iab

578
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,919
program that is designing a new rfc

579
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,159
editor model because this program has

580
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,000
basically concluded at work it's still

581
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,360
open if we need to

582
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
and pick up anything again but

583
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,679
effectively we are done here and the new

584
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,080
model has quite changed quite quite a

585
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,960
bit i've presented a few hints about

586
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,760
this at the last plenaries already

587
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,440
but if you want to know all the details

588
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,039
you probably have to read the document

589
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,120
so we'll not go through this here i just

590
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,279
wanted to report back where we are and

591
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,559
the status is um that the the program is

592
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,640
basically ready with their work and

593
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,600
handed it to the iab we already had like

594
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,400
a four week community feedback call

595
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
and we got a lot of feedback because we

596
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,000
reached out to many community members

597
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,240
and asked for previews actively to make

598
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,480
sure people are aware and we have

599
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
considered all different angles

600
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
and we got a lot of good feedback

601
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
fortunately we didn't get any like big

602
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,840
issues out of that i mean there were

603
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,760
definitely some concerns

604
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,679
but nothing that we didn't discuss that

605
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,120
lengthy in the program already and

606
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,960
nothing that we didn't consider so the

607
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,279
bunch of clarifications and make sure

608
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,240
we're going in the right direction here

609
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,640
so the iab has also reviewed

610
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,720
the last version um

611
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
which was like just published a few days

612
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,760
ago was like the last editorial changes

613
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
and effectively approved this document

614
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
what we're doing right now is we're

615
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,360
actually waiting for three additional

616
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,640
documents that are small updates to

617
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,039
existing process documents that are

618
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,120
going through the ietf stream

619
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,440
these have effectively also

620
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,600
been approved by the ihg to a certain

621
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,360
extent already but one of the documents

622
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,279
we missed something as always so there

623
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,159
will be another working itf last call

624
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,000
and that's what we're waiting for

625
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,279
but um

626
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,279
yeah to make the message short is like

627
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,360
we're done and we're heading forwards

628
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,520
and thank you everybody who was involved

629
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,200
because that was quite a big effort at

630
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,320
the end

631
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,640
thanks to the chairs to the editor of

632
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,720
the document everybody being involved in

633
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,840
the discussion all the reviewers

634
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,200
i think

635
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,720
it's good to see that we work

636
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,640
productively together and get this done

637
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
yeah and this is my last slide also as

638
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,679
usually an opportunity to thank those

639
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,120
people that we appoint into different

640
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,880
positions

641
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,760
um

642
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,679
we already have selected somebody for

643
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,600
the isoc board of trustees but we will

644
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,120
wait for the announcement um to

645
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,039
coordinate with istock respectively so

646
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,039
this is still a secret

647
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,240
um but i can thank um peter

648
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,080
who has been reappointed to the icann

649
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,080
technical esau group to taking over this

650
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,880
position again or keeping this position

651
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,799
and then this is also always a good

652
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,399
chance for us

653
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,440
to

654
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,960
tell you about our open calls do you

655
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,600
want to say something last

656
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,640
the mic is not even on

657
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,679
mike is not working

658
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,440
[Music]

659
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,480
yeah but i see like this is very

660
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,600
important to last so i make sure i point

661
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
it out carefully

662
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,720
um

663
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,559
we have two open calls

664
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,720
one is for the icann root server systems

665
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,640
government working group and now jared

666
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,000
wants to say something but the mic is

667
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,919
still not working yeah

668
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,320
maybe it'll maybe it'll work but i'm

669
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
guessing that in the future we may need

670
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,480
to use a larger font size for the future

671
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,039
ietf meetings

672
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,480
it's i think it's this green background

673
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,080
color which is irritating here

674
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,320
okay let me start again because that is

675
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,159
important for the iab

676
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,720
um so we have two open calls

677
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,480
uh one is for the icann root server

678
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,640
government working group um so this

679
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,720
group is that isn't supposed to be

680

it's difficult i think for many

organizations to understand what value

816
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,720
they get from sponsoring a meeting that

817
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,119
is has lower in-person attendance where

818
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,720
you don't know what who's going to be

819

here

820
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,720

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,040
from our global hosts and global

933
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,000
supporters these are companies that sign

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,280
six or nine years

give us um money every year towards that

937
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,320
and then host these meetings and without

938
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,440
them really we could not run the

939
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,800
meetings they're extraordinarily

940
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,920

your commitment is tremendous

945
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,119
particularly over the long terms it's

946
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,720
very difficult for i think for people to

947
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,400
get budgets in corporates to last this

948
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
long and they do so i'm very impressed

949
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,680
by that thank you

950
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,319
so these are our upcoming meetings

951
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,800
we have philadelphia then we have london

952
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
in

953
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,400
later in the year in november

954
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,040
we

955
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,599
[Music]

956
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,560
still working on um asia for 116. we

957
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,000
hope to have an announcement about that

958
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,160
soon it's it's a bit

959
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,200
complicated because of um covid to

960
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,280
uh come make contractual arrangements

961
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,240
with hotels the um to put it bluntly

962
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,440
they don't believe that we're not going

963
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,280
to cancel so it's just taking a bit of

964
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,560
time for us to arrange these things but

965
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,800
hopefully that will be arranged soon

966
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,240
we have san francisco one of the

967
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,200
rearranged meetings um prague and then

968
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,839
asia which we're looking at

969
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,680
one of the moved meetings from and

970
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,079
vancouver which was a move meeting so we

971
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,520
we are filling up the pipeline of

972
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,359
meetings coming forward we are still

973
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,599
interested in new ideas and new places

974
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,160
to go to and things or old ideas and old

975
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,920
places to go to

976
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,760
for example i'm told that london has

977
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,520
been completely rebuilt and we probably

978
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,119
won't lose that many of you there this

979
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,760
time so um you know please let us know

980
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,880
your favorite locations

981
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,040
right the registration numbers i think

982
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,599
those might be slightly out actually so

983
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,400
um

984
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
we'll look at those later lars figures

985
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
are the ones that believe on that

986
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,319
currently

987
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,839
right so this is um

988
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,000
us the staff

989
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,079
that's me approximately 25 years ago on

990
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,839
the left but why would i change the

991
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,160
picture and then we have greg wood over

992
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,000
there our director of operations lee

993
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,440
berkeley shaw our director of

994
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,599
development kasara one of our software

995
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,920
developers is somewhere in the room and

996
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,480
um nick is another software developer

997
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,520
who's not joined us this time

998
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,880
right so as a small thing about the itf

999
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,640
endowment so the intf endowment is

1000
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,200
created to support the iotf and its um

1001
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,359
activities in the long term to create

1002
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,480
long-term sustainability um we are

1003
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,119
basically trying to raise money so that

1004
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,000
then

1005
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,920
at some point in the future it would be

1006
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
possible to live off the interest of all

1007
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,760
the the investment income from the

1008
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,839
endowment if that's the case

1009
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,680
it gives us a diversity of income makes

1010
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,400
us not reliant on any particular funder

1011
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,560
or and not reliance on any particular

1012
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,800
industry or

1013
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
set of companies in that way is

1014
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
something we would like to get to and we

1015
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,760
have a goal of trying to raise 50

1016
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,880
million us dollars by 2027.

1017
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,599
this is particularly useful particularly

1018
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,480
helped at the moment by a commitment

1019
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,000
from the internet society to match fund

1020
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,720
any donations we get so

1021
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,640
on the first 12 million

1022
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,040
we get a two to one match funding and

1023
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
then on the subsequent six million we

1024
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,400
get a

1025
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,040
one-to-one match funding so uh internet

1026
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,280
society could end up giving us 30

1027
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,920
million of us raising 80 million 18

1028
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,319
million so that's a huge amount that

1029
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,359
really is

1030
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,800
very useful for us so if you um

1031
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,280

1032

1084
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,680
mention

1085
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,760
shortly planning a

1086
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,160
strategic planning retreat and as with

1087
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,400
prior years we'll have large sections of

1088
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,920
time where

1089
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,480
people can observe and ask questions and

1090
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,880
so on

1091
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,760
so in terms of the current work things

1092
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,119
that we have

1093
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,440
recently completed this year since the

1094
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,480
last meeting or are currently working on

1095
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,960
we've made changes to the investment

1096
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,200
policy following recommendations from

1097
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,319
our financial advisors goldman sachs

1098
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,400
in essence um increasing our exposure to

1099
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,160
equity investments

1100
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,680
and also

1101
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,440
considering the possibility of private

1102
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,599
equity investments over time

1103
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,520
uh similar to many other nonprofit funds

1104
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,599
we've also been working obviously on

1105
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,200
this meeting um working with the

1106
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,359
executive director jay and all of the

1107
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,200
other folks here in particular the noc

1108
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,640
team

1109
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,960
to make sure that the first hybrid

1110
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,599
meeting got carried off all right and uh

1111
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,359
be very much looking forward to feedback

1112
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,560
because i think

1113
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,240
um as probably lars said at the

1114
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,119
beginning

1115
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,640
you know this is a model that will

1116
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,800
likely persist for some time

1117
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,599
and um you know making it work great for

1118
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,720
both in-person and on-site and remote

1119
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,680
excuse me participants is important

1120
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,160
number three we've been assessing

1121
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,119
potential policy needs and changes

1122
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,200
related to antitrust

1123
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,880
there's been some list discussion about

1124
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,839
that of course and we are inching closer

1125
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,359
and closer to uh to sort of a final uh

1126
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,359
decision on some of those things

1127
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,960
so stay tuned

1128
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,359
uh and of course as i think jay may have

1129
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,000
noted he's relocated now

1130
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,839
to the united kingdom to london area

1131
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,079
uh greater london from new zealand and

1132
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,800
so we've had to do a bunch of

1133
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,960
you know legal and benefits changes with

1134
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,280
our employment management company

1135
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,200
uh and lots of odd you know inter

1136
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,640
sort of legal changes but you know

1137
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,079
important stuff to get right to take

1138
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,200
care of our employees like jay

1139
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,040
we're all obviously also planning the

1140
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,760
annual strategic planning retreat we

1141
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,640
should have some dates out fairly soon

1142
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,559
and again as i noted welcome

1143
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,800
participation and we've been increasing

1144
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,960
focus on fundraising so that

1145
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,760
fundraising topic is now on our monthly

1146
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,839
agenda and it's something that we are

1147
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,119
focusing on

1148
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,200
all the time to see

1149
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,119
that we're making maximum use of that

1150
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,079
isoc program

1151
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,800
in terms of prior fiscal year operating

1152
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,640
budget

1153
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,520
this will look a lot better as we enter

1154
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,240
into 2022 because we had the sort of

1155
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,640
outstanding accounting

1156
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,880
issue with the way that isoc funding got

1157
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,119
recognized last fiscal year or two

1158
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,359
fiscal years ago excuse me

1159
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,079
so last fiscal year ends up looking odd

1160
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,480
we'll have audited results um you know

1161
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,720
in the relatively near future

1162
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,440
and you know everything is

1163
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,400
generally

1164
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,559
on track i think we've continued to

1165
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,440
weather the covet 19 disruptions fairly

1166
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,880
well

1167
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,800
but again a lot of the the weird

1168
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,559
variances that we see are just due to

1169
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,559
this one-time eyesock thing and

1170
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,720
that is um should not be an issue for

1171
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,319
this fiscal year so it'll be easier to

1172
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,839
read our financial statements

1173
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,920
and of course these are all the ways

1174
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,480
that you can get in contact with us

1175
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,240
feel free to reach out at any time on

1176
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,920
any subject

1177
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,000
in any of these these different ways

1178
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,160
that you'd like and of course lots of

awesome hi i'm glendi uh from comcast

1188
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,079
nbc universal i am the chair of the ictf

1189
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,400
trust

1190
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,760
so these are the five trustees

1191
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,040
they are selected by the eye tip nom com

1192
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,559
one of them is selected by the island

1193
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,520
border trustees and one is selected by

1194
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,119
um the iesg and we've been same sort of

1195
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,559
uh group now for

1196
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,200
a few years which is good because having

1197
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,119
trustees around the sort of know the lay

1198
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,680
of the land it's

1199
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,680
always good to have people

1200
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,760
that they're well engaged and well aware

1201
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,960
of the background

1202
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,119
um these are some boilerplate plate

1203
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,359
slides because a lot of people you know

1204
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,559
don't really know what the trust does

1205
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,640
we're pretty quiet bunch and that's a

1206
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,000
good thing because we deal with legal

1207
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
stuff and when legal things are nice and

1208
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,359
quiet uh that's the ideal situation

1209
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,160
but basically we hold ip assets this is

1210
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,079
like copyrights and

1211
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,400
trademarks and domains and software

1212
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,760
licenses uh on behalf of the itf ayanna

1213
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,960
ican

1214
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,119
and and water internet related

1215
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,440
activities uh and we make sure these

1216
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,680
things are protected and and

1217
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,240
free to use as appropriate but also that

1218
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,920
we don't accidentally lose control of

1219
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,160
them uh through some slippage around you

1220
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,160
know not complying with laws and

1221
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,559
jurisdictional requirements

1222
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,119
uh we're a currently a virginia common

1223
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,520
trust uh we're a nonprofit

1224
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,839
uh and uh as i said we have five

1225
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,520
trustees we're a small group well the

1226
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,720
budget is about a hundred thousand

1227
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,280
dollars uh keep it light keep it tight

1228
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,400
and most that goes towards legal fees

1229
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,760
what i want to talk to you today about

1230
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,319
though is that the trust is having a bit

1231
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,599
of a problem

1232
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,880
and it revolves around uh insurance

1233
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,079
uh

1234
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,599
trusts when we were created back in 2005

1235
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,079
um have evolved a lot and

1236
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:06,800
uh

1237
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,359
we historically carry uh

1238
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,280
a lot of insurance on our uh

1239
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,440
professional liability and directors and

1240
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,040
officers insurance uh to protect the

1241
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,480
trustees when you sign up to be a

1242
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,319
trustee uh because of the nature of

1243
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,559
trust trustees literally own the trust

1244
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,520
they are the owners of all the assets of

1245
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,359
the trust and they are

1246
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,880
themselves uh

1247
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,400
their personal liabilities are

1248
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,000
intertwined

1249
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,720
with the uh the trust and its assets and

1250
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
the activity so if the trust gets sued

1251
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,800
uh one of the consequences of trustees

1252
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,280
themselves can be named as part of the

1253
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,280
the suit so we hear a lot of good

1254
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,359
insurance on that to protect the people

1255
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,280
who volunteer to become trustees vote

1256
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,119
all trustees are not comp say they're

1257
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,800
all volunteers

1258
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
and we've run into a problem the last

1259
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
few years we've tried to increase the

1260
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,040
amount of coverage uh through our

1261
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,920
insurance broker uh to a level that is

1262
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,319
appropriate for both inflation and the

1263
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,559
legal risk that we see in the landscape

1264
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,400
the trouble is that uh

1265
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,480
the market for insurance providers for

1266
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,599
trusts uh really is very limited uh

1267
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,880
there's a very few companies that

1268
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,920
provide it

1269
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,520
and those that do provide like the one

1270
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,880
we currently use aren't interested in

1271
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,400
increasing the limits

1272
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,000
uh part of this is because the trusts

1273
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,400
are very often these days used for

1274
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,880
other activities such as real estate

1275
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,800
holdings uh generational wealth

1276
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,400
management uh tax um efficiency

1277
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,720
and not so much use for

1278
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,040
uh what we do protecting you know the

1279
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,920
the ip materials for the itf and the

1280
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,920
other parties that we work with

1281
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,520
so this has created a problem for us we

1282
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,800
we've been scratching our heads about

1283
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,319
how to uh deal with this for the last

1284
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,359
few years

1285
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,920
and uh so we're looking at the landscape

1286
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,920
and maybe making some changes to the itf

1287
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,880
trust structure

1288
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,200
relating to this is as i mentioned the

1289
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,000
individual trustee liability um

1290
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,520
the current structure of the trust

1291
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,520
because the trustees themselves own the

1292
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,760
trust and all the assets they themselves

1293
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,000
take on a lot of legal liability and in

1294
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,480
fact when you become a trustee uh we

1295
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,480
give you a document that says hey read

1296
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,319
this over and by the way don't just read

1297
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,960
this and sign it quickly read this over

1298
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,160
it has a lot of stuff you are taking on

1299
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,079
and uh you know anecdotally we know

1300
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,440
there are people within the icf

1301
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,480
community

1302
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,240
that have seriously considered being a

1303
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,640
trustee looked at this and said oh no no

1304
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,599
no

1305
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,280
that's i'm not going to take on that

1306
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,760
personal liability um for myself the

1307
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,440
risk is just too high

1308
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,240
and so we've been sort of trying to uh

1309
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,160
figure out the path forward given these

1310
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,040
two key issues that are causing us uh

1311
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,200
you know personal liability making our

1312
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,760
pool of trustee candidates smaller

1313
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,720
and

1314
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,079
proper insurance levels to make sure the

1315
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,400
ones that do get selected and serve are

1316
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,319
well protected and one of the things

1317
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,800
we've observed is that while trusts have

1318
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,240
a lot of problems

1319
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,040
uh corporations don't

1320
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,400
and

1321
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
it breaks down to that corporations have

1322
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,359
within the legal frameworks uh that they

1323
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,119
operate under more protection for

1324
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,400
directors because directors aren't

1325
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,960
owners they're just demoted to

1326
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,960
the um down to a person serving to help

1327
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,640
run the corporation

1328
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,599
and

1329
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,000
they have more legal liabilities that

1330
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,960
help

1331
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,599
them along with there's a very large

1332
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:20,720
insurance market that will provide

1333
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,680
insurance coverage to such entities

1334
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,720
so

1335
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,119
we're exploring the possibility of

1336
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,319
restructuring the ihf trust on a legal

1337
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:31,280
basis

1338
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,839
into a not-for-profit corporation from a

1339
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,040
trust

1340
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,000
now

1341
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,240
in reality very little would change

1342
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,799
awkwardly if we did this right all the

1343
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,400
trust's current assets would just

1344
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
transfer over to the new entity

1345
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,160
all the current licenses we do and the

1346
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,599
way we do them and the way we make them

1347
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,040
available for people to use would all

1348
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,480
transfer as well

1349
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,240
we're gonna demote the truck trustees

1350
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,160
though they get their motor to just be

1351
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,480
directors no longer would they be owners

1352
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,559
uh and we would also move from virginia

1353
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,559
uh probably to delaware where the united

1354
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,079
states is very popular to do

1355
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,319
corporations um

1356
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,559
the itf llc for instance is in fact uh

1357
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,559
based in delaware

1358
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,760
uh

1359
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,200
what would not change

1360
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,079
the role and service to the itf and all

1361
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,520
the other communities that make use of

1362
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,680
the trust's assets would not change in

1363
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,799
any way

1364
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,880
licenses would stay the same and we

1365
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,880
would continue to be a 501 c 3 entity so

1366
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,240
nonprofit

1367
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,440
as well the other thing we're not going

1368
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,200
to rule and change is how the trustees

1369
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,480
are selected

1370
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,839
or in this case the new directors would

1371
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,160
be selected uh there would be still be

1372
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,760
five of them the selection process would

1373
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,079
still follow the process you know by 80

1374
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,760
rfc 87

1375
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,880
14

1376
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,359
um but it was just the legal definition

1377
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,119
of how we're registered as an entity

1378
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,599
that would basically trust change

1379
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:48,400
so

1380
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,880
that's pretty big delay in the community

1381
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,760
um

1382
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,440
there's an obvious question why don't we

1383
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,160
just fold this under the itf llc we went

1384
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,280
all the work

1385
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,240
in

1386
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,720
uh you know to create it uh why don't we

1387
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,720
just hold on and i won't go into this

1388
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,760
slide in detail but there are

1389
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,720
some dependencies upon the trust being

1390
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,480
an independent entity

1391
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,319
uh that have been established from the

1392
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,720
very beginning uh and along with some

1393
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,480
requirements that

1394
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,440
uh because the llc is associated with

1395
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,440
isoc as a

1396
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,559
um

1397
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,119
as an entity uh officially you know

1398
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,400
disregarded uh entity by eyestock

1399
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,440
transferring the assets of the trust to

1400
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,680
the llc would effectively be given an

1401
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,640
arms

1402
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,079
uh length relationship to isoc and both

1403
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,880
the original founding agreement for 2005

1404
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,960
had a particular restriction that that

1405
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,839
can't be done with the trust's assets

1406
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,839
uh and then later on in 2016 when we did

1407
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,319
the ia transition and the trust took on

1408
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,119
some service diana and i can communities

1409
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,920
that was done with the expectation that

1410
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,839
the trust was an independent entity so

1411
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,119
we've looked at this we don't think this

1412
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,680
is an option

1413
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,760
so we've

1414
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,359
been looking at this we've been

1415
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,280
consulting with attorneys and so we're

1416
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,960
going to do is the following we are

1417
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,880
going to open up a consultation with the

1418
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,559
communities that make use of the trust

1419
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,640
this includes the itf

1420
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,920
i can uh the rars

1421
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,160
uh we're going to use the tlp interest

1422
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,680
list over at theitf.org for comments and

1423
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,839
questions and we're gonna hold a

1424
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,640
multi-hour webinar in april uh for

1425
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,160
anybody's interested in this topic to

1426
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,559
come and talk uh we're gonna explain why

1427
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,000
we're thinking of what we're gonna do

1428
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,760
how it would look and then open for

1429
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,160
discussion uh you know opinions concerns

1430
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,640
ideas uh we want to hear from people

1431
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,920
we're not just going to go off and do

1432
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,920
this you know in a vacuum uh this is a

1433
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,880
community conversation to have uh

1434
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,400
to figure out what the right path

1435
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,280
forward uh for the the trust and for the

1436
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,440
assets that managers are

1437
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,200
and with that

1438
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,760

00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,760
uh part of the

1445
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,119
um

1446
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,079
um

1447
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,079
agenda and and jared will be happy to

1448
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,760
hear that the the rumors of my

1449
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,520
diminishing eyesight are vastly over

1450
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,440
exaggerated but my glasses do up

1451
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,200
when i wear a mask so i actually did not

1452
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,440
see that thing on the slide earlier

1453
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,880
i'm very sorry but everybody's paying

1454
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,160
attention that's great

1455
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,920
um right

1456
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,970
first up is the outgoing iab members

1457
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:34,799
[Music]

1458
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,440
yeah and we have um two outgoing ib

1459
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,280
members that i would like to to thank

1460
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,520
for a service today both of them have

1461
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,200
served for two years

1462
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,119
on the iab so they have been fully

1463
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,599
virtual iap members

1464
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:48,559
um

1465
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,680
i think that was challenging and i i at

1466
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,839
least had still a good time working with

1467
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:54,640
them

1468
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,799
i would like to um start with jared

1469
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,280
because he is actually here in person so

1470
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,359
at least i had finally a chance to meet

1471
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,280
him in person after two years of only

1472
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,799
online meetings

1473
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,960
and we had a couple of chats online as

1474
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,720
well so i do have the feeling i actually

1475
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,000
know you well but it's not the same

1476
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
and so i'm happy that we at least met at

1477
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,240
this very last meeting

1478
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,200
i think

1479
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,119
despite the challenges we had the last

1480
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,520
two years with the wichita setup it was

1481
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,400
great to have you on the iab um you have

1482
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,440
strong opinions very often but

1483
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,920
but it's uh it's good to have different

1484
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,880
angles and and we had some discussions

1485
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,839
uh we we do agree on a couple of points

1486
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,160
but sometimes also disagree and it's

1487
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,160
very important for the iab to have all

1488
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,920
these different views in the discussion

1489
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,079
and make sure we represent in this way

1490
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,839
also a little bit the community

1491
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,040

1492

1508
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,520
iab for two years

1509
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,839
uh at least for me it was a little bit

1510
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,599
easier because i was serving together

1511
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,920
with ben on the ihd already so i know

1512
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,559
him very well he has always been a very

1513
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,119
very kind person and

1514
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,280
contributed to discussion always in a

1515
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,760
common kind way he was always there to

1516
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,160
pick up any tasks if needed

1517
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,480
and so we would definitely also miss you

1518
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,000
on the iap ben

1519
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,640

1521

[Applause]

1525

we'll do the isg recognition next but

1526
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:20,799
first i want to say actually ben was

1527
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,960
also the liaison during the last year at

1528
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,640
least to the iesg and so we've worked

1529
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,240
with them as well and ben

1530
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,319
has written some of the best um short

1531
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,799
reports from the isg from the iasg and

1532
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:31,920

1533
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,160
from the i to the iab on what the isg is

1534
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,119
doing

1535
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,400
and they're so good that i actually

1536
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,920
internally forward them to my boss and

1537
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,920
say this is what i did this week and

1538
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,280
there's always like three things that i

1539
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,440
forgot about but ben didn't forget it he

1540
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,880
put them in it's a nicely bulleted list

1541
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,040
and it's been extremely useful and

1542
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,079
whoever we get and we need we need that

1543
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,160
level of reporting was excellent uh so

1544
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,319

martial for the for the riding area um

1554
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,880
some of you in the audience have done

1555
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
this job and some of you remotely have

1556
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,039
done this job and you know it's often

1557
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,480
thankless

1558
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,000

1559
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,119
both of them

1560
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,079
are unfortunately not here so

1561
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,920
when the open mic later on gets boring

1562
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,920
maybe take a minute and send them a

1563
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,480
message and thank them for their service

1564
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,559
because while it can be you know not

1565
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,799
often fun to argue with an ad who has

1566
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,039
requests for you as an author i think

1567
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,880
that the reviews actually do help make

1568
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,280
the documents better and we need people

1569
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,599
like that are willing to serve and

1570
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,920
ask hard questions and do the work so

1571
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,830
thank you very much ben and my turn

1572
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:58,079
[Applause]

1573
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,000
and with that i want to pass over to

1574
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
john

1575
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,119
um

1576
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,960
give me the slides you can actually just

1577
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,599
forward it too either way

1578
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,880
i think i'm giving you control

1579
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,440
yeah there we go

1580
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,680
so

1581
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,200
susan

1582
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,039
r harris

1583
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,960
it was always susan

1584
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,559
never sue and the r is really important

1585
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,039
because she worked with both susan hares

1586
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:35,280
and another susan harris

1587
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,720
so susan r harris she passed away

1588
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,160
on march 6 after a short and um and

1589
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,839
she'd probably have said inconvenient

1590
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:46,720
battle with cancer

1591
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,119
um

1592
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,760
susan was an outstanding writer and and

1593
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,240
nerd whisperer

1594
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,558
and

1595
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,400
in the days before

1596
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,160
everyone knew that of course the

1597
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,000
internet was going to be a big deal

1598
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,039
she was instrumental in explaining it to

1599
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,720
decision makers who

1600
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,799
needed to know that this was important

1601
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,640
stuff

1602
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,280
she played a key part in getting nanog

1603
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,880
off the ground

1604
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,760
as it evolved from the earlier nsf net

1605
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,559
regional text group

1606
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,440
she authored a number of important rfcs

1607
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,480
notably the dao of iatf the discussion

1608
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,079
list charter

1609
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,760
her license plate was rfc 3005

1610
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,039
the guidelines for conduct

1611
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,000
her her keen skills as a writer and

1612
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,079
editor were complimented

1613
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:43,200
by her

1614
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,480
dry self-deprecating wit

1615
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,440
and her generosity of spirit

1616
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,200
she was a good co-worker collaborator

1617
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,480
colleague

1618
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,960

1646
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,440
talk about the um

1647
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,000
a bit about the ietf endowment

1648
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,839
for a moment the um we are now

1649
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:21,839
for several meetings had an option on

1650
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,920
the registration to donate a little

1651
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,160
money to the ietf

1652
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,240
and i've been doing that for the last

1653
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,079
few meetings and since it's been

1654
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,599
available and it's an easy way to chuck

1655
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,520
a few extra bucks there and i was

1656
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,280
talking with lee berkeley during the

1657
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,039
hackathon and she said now that money is

1658
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,599
going to the endowment so it's getting

1659
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,440
the benefit of the matched funds from

1660
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,760
isoc so i just wanted to encourage

1661

1662
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,440

01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,319

1672
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,079
i don't think so

1673
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,240
okay this was very short thank you very

1674

up next is the isg

01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:25,840
always been looking for good candidates

1837
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,080
for many of the positions so if you have

1838
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,360
extra time

1839
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,600
please let us know

1840
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,120
yeah that's also a good point so it's

1841
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,199
like um some of these positions we need

1842
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,440
very specified expertise so it's not

1843
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,199
like a huge set where you should drawing

1844
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,760
from and it's always hard to find a

1845
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,480
diverse set of candidates and also

1846
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,880
selecting people who might bring into

1847
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,640
some more diversity and so some of these

1848
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,800
sports so the more volunteers we have

1849
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,480
for any of these positions the better

1850
