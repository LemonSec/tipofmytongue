1
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,160
give people a few minutes

2
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,079
so

3
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,280
so

4
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,840
okay

5
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,640
good

6
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,840
hey greg

7
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
if people turn on their video do they

8
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,480
appear in this room on that screen

9
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,800
okay

10
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
oh there's karen appearing on that

11
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
screen well done

12
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,360
good to know

13
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
we'll get started in just a minute

14
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,200
if you have not yet uh logged in

15
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,599
please do so that you get on the

16
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,399
attendance sheet

17
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,959
and if you know how to get to the data

18
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,920
tracker and get to the agenda page

19
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,720
you can log into the full client that qr

20
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,959
code will get you to the simplified

21
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,080
client

22
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
but if you'd like to see the chat room

23
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,040
you can log in on your laptop

24
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
just giving people a few more minutes to

25
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,720
float into the room

26
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
all right i think we should probably get

27
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,680
started

28
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,240
welcome everybody

29
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,039
to ietf 113

30
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,400
and to the newcomers overview and new

31
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
comers in this sense means if you

32
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,160
haven't been to too many meetings

33
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,039
this is more or less the how do i

34
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,280
get involved and start participating in

35
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,320
a meeting and be most effective

36
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
this is going to be our first hybrid

37
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,360
meeting both in person and remote

38
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,160

39
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160

45
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
and i'll try and walk you through this

46

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120

48
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,320

68
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,840
so

69
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,880
let's see if i can make this thing work

70
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,039
hey there we go so we're going to go

71
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,080
through an introduction and an overview

72
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
for

73
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
the newcomers activities we're going to

74
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,720
talk about the structure of the ietf

75
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,560
we're going to talk about

76
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
how

77
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
the meeting week is going to go

78
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
supposedly and we'll talk a little bit

79
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,639
about

80
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,720
resources and people and tools and

81
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,080
information that you can get at

82
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,319
we're

83
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,800
going to try and limit this to stuff

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
that's immediately useful to you as a an

85
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,520
attendee who hasn't been here for too

86
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,400
long

87
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,319
uh and strategies to make the most of

88
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,520
the meeting

89
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,000
but we used to do a lot more about the

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
history of the ietf and how to write a

91
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
standard we'll leave that for other

92
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
presentations and discussions and try

93
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,599
and keep this a little shorter

94
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,199
if you're just coming into the room if

95
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,960
you would please

96
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,599
go ahead and either log in on the qr

97
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,919
code that's on the screen or if you have

98
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,560
access to the agenda log into the meet

99
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,639
echo room because that will put you on

100
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,039
the attendees list and if you log into

101
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,319
the full version

102
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
on your laptop you'll be able to see the

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
chat and things going on in there

104
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,840
so

105
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
this slide and the following one you

106
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,160
will get to see it every session at the

107
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,759
ietf

108
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,560
it's

109
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,199
basically we call it the notewell

110
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,440
because of course on the login screen it

111
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,479
says note well all of these things

112
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,440
this is a reminder of iatf policies that

113
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,960
are in effect

114
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,160
and things that you should read up on

115
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,440
there's a lot of focus on our patent

116
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
policies because people who have

117
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,520
corporate interests that have patents

118
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,319
care about those very much but this also

119
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,000
applies to

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,479
um policies

121
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,039
that have to do with your behavior

122
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,960
with how to interact

123
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,320
and uh whether photographs will be taken

124
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,919
which they will

125
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,880
um

126
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,760
and as a participant you agree to all of

127
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,200
these things

128
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,679
there's a set of different policies that

129
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,000
you can take a look at

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
they include the standards process

131
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,560
working group processes

132
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
the anti-harassment procedures codes of

133
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,040
conduct copyright

134
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,800
patents etc

135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,680
please do take a look at these

136
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,040
if you have any questions feel free to

137
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,560
ask either any of the session chairs or

138
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
folks in the leadership and we'll talk

139
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
about who those are

140
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920

let's first go to our lovely mission

174
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,680
statement so the mission of the ietf is

175
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,000
to make the internet work better

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,160
by producing high quality relevant

177
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,480
technical documents that influence the

178
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
way people design use and manage the

179
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,640
internet that's from one of our rfcs

180
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,560
so we're trying to

181
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,640
produce protocols that make the internet

182
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,120
work

183
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
the ietf is at core a standards

184
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,360
development organization

185
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
but it's a little different than most

186
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,160
sdos that you may have been involved in

187
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
in the past

188
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,200
first of all

189
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,959
this is self-selected individual

190
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,480
participants

191
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,720
there is no formal membership

192
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,240
you show up here you show up online

193
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,440
if you just

194
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
go ahead and join one of the mailing

195
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
lists and start participating by email

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,240
you have become a participant in the

197
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
ietf the magic has happened there's no

198
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
formal signups

199
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
so

200
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
that's a little different than the way

201
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,600
most sdos function

202
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,959
we are driven mostly by market-based

203
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,480
adoption that is to say a real standard

204
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
is one that gets used and our procedures

205
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,480
talk

206
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,800
in terms of deployment

207
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,120
of protocols

208
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,079
we're focused on internet technologies

209
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,640
as opposed to others and i'll show you

210
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,320
the where we sort of fall in place

211
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,200
um

212
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,760
but what's sort of unique about the ietf

213
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,560
is how bottom-up we are

214
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,040
there's no formal voting in the ietf

215
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,760
people don't get votes simply because

216
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,680
our membership is individual and not

217
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
formal therefore how would you know who

218
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,279
the constituency is who is voting we do

219
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,399
hum i'll talk about that a little later

220
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,320
but that's a different sort of weird

221
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
thing that we do

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,560
there's no formal government role in

223
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,880
the ietf at all

224
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,680
and you'll also notice there are no

225
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
booth sales presentations sales related

226
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
activities

227
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,760
that sort of thing doesn't go on here

228
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,519
we're here to talk about the technical

229
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,480
standards and work on them

230
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,480
i see well we'll uh the there are

231
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
certain slides in here that i had marked

232
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,920
as skip on by and uh

233
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
meat echo doesn't recognize that just

234
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,839
yet so we'll skip on by it anyway

235
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,279
so big picture

236
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,160
these are the different groups that you

237
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,200
will be

238
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
seeing at the ietf

239
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,279
the iesg the internet engineering

240
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,880
steering group

241
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,279
is our basic leadership for

242
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,680
standardization activity

243
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
those are the folks who actually read

244
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,320
over and approve the standards and make

245
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,880
sure that there is ietf wide consensus

246
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,360
on the standards that we produce

247
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,320
and under each of them

248
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,760
under the

249
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
iasg the iesg is made up of area

250
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,519
directors and so there are usually two

251
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,000
sometimes one sometimes three area

252
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,279
directors for each area of the ietf and

253
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,320
working groups underneath them

254
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,360
separate from the ietf

255
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,760
is the irtf our research wing the

256
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,320
internet research task force and there

257
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,600
is a steering group of the irtf called

258
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
the irsg

259
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,920
the irsg is made up of the chairs of the

260
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
different research groups

261
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
there will be

262
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,040
irsg meetings this week or i i rtf

263
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
meetings this week that you're welcome

264
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,959
to go and participate in

265
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,959
uh just like the ietf they are open

266
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,720
participation

267
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,760
irtf work is a little different

268
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,440
structured a little different and the

269
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
different kinds of work that they do

270
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,560
but

271
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,240
also very interesting and you might want

272
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,839
to dive in there

273
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,120
much more academic than the ietf

274
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880
the internet architecture board you'll

275
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,720
see is its own little box the internet

276
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
architecture board provides

277
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,800
architectural oversight to the ietf but

278
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,720
doesn't have a formal role in approving

279
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,920
standards

280
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,279
so they're a separate body

281
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,120
and they do some of the uh approving

282
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
appointments duties and and liaisons

283
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
with external organizations but they are

284
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,240
sort of off on their own they have

285
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,800
oversight functions but not a formal

286
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
standardization function

287
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,639
the other group that you will be

288
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,839
interested to know about is the llc the

289
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,760
which is a limited liability corporation

290
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
for those who are not us

291
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,800
based legal people um

292
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
the ietf llc is more or less the

293
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
corporate home

294
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,160
they are the real corporate entity

295
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,920
for the ietf the iab the irtf but they

296
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,600
simply provide our fiscal and

297
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,079
administrative support they also have no

298
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,480
role in standardization but the folks

299
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,720
you see at the secretariat's desk

300
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,680
work under the auspices of the llc and

301
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,000
i'll point out some of the people that

302
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,320
make that up

303
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,079
and then there are the rfc editor in

304
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,399
iana which are separate entities and we

305
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,440
can talk about those in a bit

306
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,480
uh let's skip on through here so

307
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,399
we have different areas in the ietf

308
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,720
each of the areas is

309
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,040
run by the area directors we've got

310
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,680
applications in real time

311
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,519
transport routing

312
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,440
the internet area operations and

313
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,800
management

314
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,320
security and then the general area

315
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,519
which focuses on policies and procedures

316
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,320
um the area director for the general

317
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
area is

318
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,360
our ietf chair so he is

319
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
um the area director who oversees the

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
general area in addition to his chair

321
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,519
duties

322
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,920
and the rest of these each have

323
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
two or three

324
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,480
area directors

325
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,519
let's talk a little bit about consensus

326
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,959
so as i said there's no voting

327
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,639
david clarke who is one of the

328
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,240
researchers who

329
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,720
was with the ietf from the beginning had

330
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
this little quote when he gave a

331
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,639
presentation he said we reject kings and

332
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,560
presidents and voting

333
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,399
we believe in rough consensus and

334
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,880
running code

335
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,399
so

336
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,199
in the ietf since we don't vote

337
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,000
the chairs or the area directors

338
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,560
will judge rough consensus

339
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,039
which is achieved when all of the issues

340
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,400
that are outstanding that people have

341
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,319
brought up have been addressed not

342
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,439
necessarily accommodated but were

343
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,280
convinced that

344
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,799
yes

345
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,359
the issues have been noticed

346
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,559
we understand the answer and

347
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,880
we have dealt with it in some way even

348
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
if it's to say we're not going to deal

349
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,919
with that

350
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,240
in the protocol

351
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,840
dissenting opinions always must be heard

352
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,919
sometimes they're not controlling

353
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,000
sometimes they are sometimes the chair

354
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,679
will say

355
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,840
that issue is outstanding even though a

356
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,080
few people disagree it's important

357
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,000
enough that that breaks the rough

358
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
consensus

359
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
uh so i mentioned humming earlier this

360
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,480
is an old tradition

361
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,400
when chairs wanted to get a sense of the

362
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
room

363
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,039
but

364
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,400
we don't vote

365
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
how would you do a straw poll without

366
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
people raising their hands and counting

367
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,720
and people didn't want to get into that

368
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,960
so the tradition was that the chair

369
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,559
would say okay people in favor of choice

370
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,360
hum

371
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,960
and the room some people in the room

372
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,120
would

373
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,640
and people in favor of choice b hum

374
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,480
and you would see which one was louder

375
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
and that would give you a hint of which

376
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,280
direction the conversation was going

377
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,080
um

378
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,600
you'll see chairs

379
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,720
do that

380
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,280
but of course this isn't a vote this is

381
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,880
just to get a sense of the room so that

382
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,440
the discussion can continue oh well more

383
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,760
people are humming in favor of choice a

384
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
let's discuss that for a while that

385
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,000
seems like there's a you know a leaning

386
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,799
in that direction

387
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,039
the session chair

388
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,520
in for a working group or

389
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,000
the area director when it comes to

390
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,280
broader questions or the isg as a whole

391
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,840
is responsible for building consensus

392
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,039
and judging that consensus

393
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,880
on

394
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,200
the working group mailing list

395
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,080
discussion continues so decisions that

396
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,799
happen in the room are not controlling

397
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,240
the chair must take it back to the

398
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,160
working group mailing list for those

399
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,480
people who aren't in attendance and make

400
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,039
sure that there's true consensus across

401
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
everybody who's participated whether in

402
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,520
person or online

403
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,600
um i wrote

404
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,880
rfc 7282 a while back it's a broad

405
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
discussion of consensus

406
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,200
a lot of people in the ietf think it's a

407
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,080
pretty

408
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,840
interesting document

409
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
it's well worth the read

410
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,440
it brings up all sorts of weird corner

411
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,520
cases about consensus and what we mean

412
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,600
in this organization

413
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,520
it's just an informational document it

414
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,000
is not one of our procedures but it'll

415
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,840
give you some hint about how some people

416
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,120
think about consensus

417
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:58,960
so

418
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,320
uh well we've discussed that already

419
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,480
as i said there's uh some duplicate

420
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,960
slides in here

421
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,880
so let's talk about the meeting week

422
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,120
and give you an idea of how the week

423
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,840
should hopefully go

424
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,760
there's a bunch of different events that

425
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,480
will occur in person here first of all

426
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,080
there are working group sessions there's

427
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,159
about

428
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:26,080
130 active working groups last week

429
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,200
counted

430
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
some of them will be meeting this week

431
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,080
not all of them

432
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,480
we don't have room for that for all of

433
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,159
us meeting

434
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,240
um there are also birds of a feather

435
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,360
sessions

436
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
we refer to them as buffs

437
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
and these are startup groups we'll talk

438
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,440
about those in a bit

439
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
the irtf as i mentioned we'll be meeting

440
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
there's about 15 research groups total

441
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
and some of those will be meeting this

442
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,120
week

443
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,640
there are area-wide sessions where

444
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,799
area directors or chairs that they

445
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,080
designate will discuss area-wide issues

446
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,760
and the plenaries and some invited talks

447
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,080
i'll talk about in a bit the hackathon

448
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,919
and the code sprint

449
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,600
um social events i don't believe we've

450
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
got any scheduled this week except for

451
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,679
the newcomers and we'll point you to the

452
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,760
newcomers page for those

453
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,159
there'll be some tutorials maybe some i

454
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,840
don't think we're doing a deep dive this

455
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
week with the iab

456
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,960
um

457
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,720
lunch sessions i believe the working

458
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,320
chairs are meeting but not much beyond

459
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,120
that

460
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,480
the lightning talks the hot rfcs will be

461
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,000
meeting this week

462
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,919
and there will be some side meetings and

463
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,480
i'll point you to where all these things

464
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,799
are

465
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,799
yeah

466
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,600
for the online folks

467
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,440
again this is our first hybrid meeting

468
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
last week

469
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,760
there were some newcomers q and a's for

470
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,600
participating online

471
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,660
this week during the coffee breaks

472
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,760
[Music]

473
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,159
the folks who are online can use the

474
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,840
gather tool i'll give you a pointer to

475
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,200
that in a moment

476
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,919
to discuss among themselves the gather

477
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,280
tool by the way

478
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
if you're in your hotel room or wherever

479
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,640
you may be

480
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,240
and you just want to join in and see

481
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,440
who's roaming around the halls online

482
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,000
uh i actually find it quite fun it's a

483
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,559
good good tool

484
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,720
um the meetings run not 0900 100 until

485
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,240
1600 i believe this week

486
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,039
and friday we end around 1400.

487
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,840
all of the session is linked on the data

488
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
tracker

489
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,840
on the

490
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,320
agenda page and the url is up here and

491
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,919
there's additional information in the

492
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,919
meet echo guide which is the online

493
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,159
participation guide

494
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,200
and

495
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,360
of course the newcomers page

496
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,640
which

497
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,080
you should become familiar with

498
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,200
and again

499
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,799
extra slides

500
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,760
so

501
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,679
the biggest part of the

502
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,360
meeting week is the working group

503
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,799
sessions

504
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,520
uh most of the work in between meetings

505
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
is done on mailing lists there are

506
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,840
interims that some working groups have

507
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,919
but the official record of what's going

508
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,760
on in the ietf is the mailing list

509
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,120
um

510
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
the face-to-face meetings tend to be

511
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,640
focused on solving issues that have not

512
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,480
been dealt with or can't be dealt with

513
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,720
on the mailing list contentious issues

514
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,240
or whatever

515
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,320
that means that for the most part when

516
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,280
you come into a face-to-face meeting if

517
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,600
you haven't read up on or are following

518
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
what's going on in the mailing list it's

519
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,320
going to be a very confusing encounter

520
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,840
because they're going to jump right into

521
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,200
open issues

522
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,000
sometimes they'll have presentations on

523
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,039
new materials sometimes

524
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,200
document editors will present about open

525
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,279
issues on the document but they tend to

526
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,600
jump right in

527
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,840
the sessions are streamed and recorded

528
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,279
so you can go back and take a look at

529
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,720
them if you need to

530
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,880
and they'll all be online

531
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,720
and

532
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,480
[Music]

533
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
each working group

534
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,320
has a charter that they have to live up

535
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,880
to these are negotiated with the area

536
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,200
director and the iasg

537
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
and so

538
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,360
if there's going to be new work items

539
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
they must fit into

540
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,080
the charter of the working group if you

541
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,760
have a topic that

542
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,000
doesn't fit into the charter the charter

543
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
would have to be rewritten which is a

544
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
a process

545
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,960
so keep in mind that you may have a

546
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,200
great idea for a working group but

547
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,799
it may not fit in the charter of what

548
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,080
the working group is currently doing

549
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,200
birds of a feather sessions or buffs

550
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,960
usually precede

551
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,720
uh the formation of a working group so

552
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,760
these are

553
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,000
get togethers to figure out how to form

554
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,159
a working group quite often sometimes we

555
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,640
have buffs

556
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,080
that are for just one shot topics to

557
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,760
sort of get an idea of where the topic

558
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
is going without being

559
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,440
working group forming

560
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,039
if they're working group forming much of

561
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,720
the discussion is how the charter will

562
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,480
look and what the working group will be

563
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,799
doing

564
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,120
people who have an interest in a

565
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,440
particular topic area bring a buff

566
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,720
proposal to one of the area directors

567
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,440
or to the iasg as a whole

568
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,679
and an area director will choose to

569
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,080
sponsor a buff

570
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,880
these generally meet only once

571
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,200
uh sometimes you can have two buff

572
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,919
meetings two meetings in a row

573
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:40,799
but

574
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,679
they are short-lived very short-lived

575
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,799
uh groups

576
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,480
the irtf sessions which go on this week

577
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,840
are officially under the iab so the iab

578
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,400
um

579
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,440
is the oversight board for the irtf

580
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,480
these are research issues as opposed to

581
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,880
engineering issues so

582
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
quite often these will be things that

583
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,480
will not produce standards well they

584
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,960
can't produce standards by definition

585
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,200
but they'll look at interesting topics

586
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
of research

587
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
we often leave space for the research

588
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,400
groups to meet during ietf week that's

589
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
uh that allows folks who participate in

590
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,320
both to see what's going on and

591
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
allows engineers to sit in on the

592
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,200
research group sessions and see what

593
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,679
potential outputs might come for

594
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,080
engineering topics

595
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,000
these are open meetings when they meet

596
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,240
here at the ietf

597
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,679
and if you want to take a look at the

598
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,880
rfc

599
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,679
that defines how the irtf runs that's

600
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,320
rfc 7418

601
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,039
we'll also have some area-wide sessions

602
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,760
as i said these are when the area

603
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
directors designate that they want to

604
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,559
hear

605
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,600
general topics so not specific

606
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
um

607
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
working groups on particular

608
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,320
engineering topics but overall what the

609
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
area is working on where there might be

610
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,200
new

611
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,520
work where there might be cross-area

612
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,400
work

613
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,840
you'll hear about it in some of these

614
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,760
area-wide sessions

615
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,640
we'll also have the plenary session

616
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,559
uh the plenary session is always amusing

617
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,440
to go to that in that one you'll get to

618
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,640
meet the iab and iesg up at the front of

619
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,720
the room and they can answer your

620
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,000
questions and they'll let you know

621
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,120
what's going on as well as the llc

622
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,279
will have representation if you find

623
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,880
that the snacks are not to your liking

624
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,240
you can get up at the microphone and

625
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
complain to the llc and

626
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,240
they will or will not take that into

627
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,440
account

628
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,760
um and we'll have an invited lunch talk

629
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,960
this week

630
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,559
uh it is on the agenda and you can go

631
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,120
take a look at that

632
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,880
the hackathon and code sprint is

633
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,120
actually going on right now

634
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,760
um the code well the code sprint is the

635
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,159
code sprint yesterday or today

636
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,200
it's today code yesterday the code

637
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,640
sprint is

638
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,520
where volunteers from the ietf help work

639
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,559
on the tools that the ietf uses

640
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,279
um so the data tracker and other parts

641
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,080
of

642
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,159
the website that you see

643
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,880
uh the hackathon is little experimental

644
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
protocols and people trying out

645
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,960
implementations and things that's always

646
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,120
lots of fun if you want to get involved

647
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,200
in the hackathon or the code sprint

648
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,880
uh the

649
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
uh information on each of those will

650
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,919
appear

651
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,480
on the meeting page and obviously you're

652
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,720
not going to be able to participate

653
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,279
right now but for the next meeting you

654
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,320
may want to get involved

655
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,279
so with regard to hackathon it is free

656
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,760
to participate open to everyone

657
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,120
it's collaborative and you're trying to

658
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,159
build

659
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,520
some

660
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,320
tools some interesting pieces

661
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,200
that

662
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,320
go with ietf protocols

663
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,639
um

664
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,200
you're going to

665
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,919
come up with ideas that might feed back

666
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,600
into the working group so you can say

667
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,679
hey we tried to build this during the

668
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,720
hackathon and we should probably update

669
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,559
our draft to say that it should go this

670
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,880
way instead of that

671
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
we get people from outside the

672
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,520
traditional ietf who go to the hackathon

673
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,880
folks from

674
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,399
uh

675
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,200
more

676
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,720
developer-centric uh areas university

677
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,880
folks

678
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,039
we see a lot of teaming up of newcomers

679
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,640
with the veterans

680
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,679
and uh we generally do these just the

684
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,440

685
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,840

686
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,440

687
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,320

688
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,080

694
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,840
information about the hackathon

695
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
like i said networking and social events

696
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,159
not so much this week

697
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,120
um

698
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,799
one other thing you want to keep an eye

699
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,760
out for is this url on public side

700
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,960
meetings there's a wiki page for people

701
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,320
who want to

702
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,159
talk about topics that aren't on the

703
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,200
agenda and we've set aside some space at

704
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,880
the ietf

705
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,240
and it will tell you the time and place

706
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,919
and the topic that's being discussed

707
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,240
and if you want to set up a side meeting

708
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
you can sign up on that wiki page and

709
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,480
reserve some space to chat with folks

710
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,399
usually this is a group of people who

711
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,760
have said we want to talk about this new

712
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,919
issue and you can come and show up for

713
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,039
that

714
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,440

715
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,360

and i

718
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,720
definitely recommend that way you can

719
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,840
talk to some of the folks who've been

720
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,919

721
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,559

722
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,880

to pay for your food

731
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,360
but

732
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
should be lots of fun so if you have the

733
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,320
chance please do

734
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,519
with regard to working groups and any of

735
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,640
the meetings that you're going to be

736
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,559
attending there's some general meeting

737
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,159
etiquette all of this should be

738
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,720
relatively obvious but uh just to remind

739
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,600
you

740
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,320
please do read documents that are on the

741
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,399
agenda before you

742
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,559
go to the working group session as i

743
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,559
said working groups tend to jump right

744
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,120
into it

745
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,399
the ietf is is a notoriously bad place

746
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,399
to figure out what's going on by going

747
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,640
to a session there's not a whole lot of

748
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,440
tutorial material so you want to catch

749
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,600
up on the reading before you go

750
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,120
because chances are there's not going to

751
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,679
be a presentation to catch you up in the

752
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,039
session itself

753
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,519
so please do find the meeting materials

754
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,960
and read up

755
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,480
obviously

756
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,399
we want everybody to behave respectfully

757
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,279
and tolerantly toward each other

758
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,320
um

759
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,760
do talk to folks especially as newcomers

760
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,159

761
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,840
and listen to folks and be uh

762
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,000

and

765

importantly enjoy yourself

766
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,600
don't try to uh don't don't get too

767
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,799
caught up in

768
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,880
uh the the serious part there's a lot of

769
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,159
fun that goes on here too

770
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,360
with regard to specific session

771
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,240
etiquette if you are here in person

772
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,840
please make sure to talk into the

773
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,039
microphone very clearly and slowly so

774
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,480
that people can understand there are

775
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,240
lots of folks who are

776
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,720
not native speakers of english and so

777
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,200
slowing down and speaking clearly will

778
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,519
help them hear you

779
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,279
please do mention your name when you get

780
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,640
to the microphone

781
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,039
the minutes takers do like to write down

782
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,360
who said what so that if there's a

783

um we

792
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,080
normally would pass around

793
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,200
these blue papers with the tendon sheets

794
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,519
but since we're hybrid this week

795
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,600

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,359
during working group sessions are

811
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,399
welcome

812
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,320
and please do bring them up when you

813
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,679
have them

814
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,560
and please do also

815
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,599
uh try logging in even if you're

816
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,639
in person to the meat echo site so that

817
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,480
you can get on the chat and watch the

818
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,760
chat go by

819
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,679
uh i've been trying to keep an eye on

820
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,280
the corner you know

821
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,119
in the corner of my screen here uh

822
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,280
karen's doing well to answer questions

823
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,839
online

824
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,040
for folks who are who are remote

825
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,640
please

826
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,400
by way of etiquette

827
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,280
try and practice using the tool ahead of

828
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,440
time test the configuration keep

829
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
yourself muted with your video off if

830
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,040
you're not speaking

831
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,359
use a headset because sometimes echo can

832
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,880
be a problem

833
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,079
and speak slowly and clearly again

834
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,480
so people are able to understand you

835
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,520
um

836
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,160
one of the new features of meat echo

837
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,400
if you get on to the full version is

838
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
down in the lower right corner there's a

839
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,359
local mute button it used to be that you

840
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,839
would turn on and off your audio and

841
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,000
there would be a delay now you can just

842
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,119
locally mute your mic which is handy

843
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,040
it is much quicker to turn on and off

844
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,119
and again technical comments always

845
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,640
welcome even if you're participating

846
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,400
remotely and use the jabber

847
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,920
meat echo chat

848
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,040
to discuss topics

849
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,800
so

850
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,720
one of the things that comes up

851
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
relatively frequently is how do i bring

852
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,520
new work to the ietf

853
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,720
um

854
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,520
a fair bit of warning about this

855
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,040
uh

856
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,599
bringing new work to the ietf generally

857
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,440
requires that you collaborate with other

858
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,640
folks

859
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,200
so writing up a document even with a

860
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,440
friend of yours and saying here it is

861
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,760
ietf please work on this

862
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,680
generally doesn't

863
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,480
uh come out very effective you want to

864
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,960
find other people in the ietf from

865
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,480
different groups

866
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,720
and say hey are you interested in

867
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,960
working on this that means to a certain

868
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,560
extent getting to know people in the

869
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,079
ietf before you bring new work

870
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:48,880
so

871
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,320
discussing

872
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,280
topics with people after sessions

873
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,359
and getting to know them if you have new

874
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,560
work to bring

875
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,960
that's a good way to get started

876
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,200
uh you can always write an internet

877
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,400
draft

878
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,800
even if you

879
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,599
[Music]

880
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,520
haven't gotten too many collaborators

881
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,440
yet at least you have a document out

882
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,960
there that you can point people to and

883
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,000
say hey this is my idea have a look

884
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,440
internet drafts

885
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,520
anybody can post them they carry no

886
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,000
particular weight other than it's just

887
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,440
an easy way to publish a document

888
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,160
you might want to have what we call

889
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,880
euphemistically a bar buff

890
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,320
so you can

891
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,000
go to the bar with a few other people

892
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and chat about the topic and get out

893
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,800
some cocktail napkins and scribble down

894
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,400
different ideas about how you want

895
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,839
things to go

896
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,200
um

897
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,680
we sort of distinguish between real barb

898
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,320
offs where it involves going to the bar

899
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,839
and writing things down on cocktail

900
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,400
napkins from these side meetings which

901
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
are a little more formal when people do

902
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,119
presentations

903
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,119
do feel free to talk to the area

904
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,920
directors in a particular area

905
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,160
many of the areas have what they call a

906
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,880
dispatch working group which is used to

907
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,480
meet up together

908
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,680
bring a new topic and see if the area is

909
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,520
interested in forming a working group

910
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,040
around the topic

911
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,000
or

912
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,640
having one of the area directors sponsor

913
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,240
work or having one of the working group

914
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,480
sponsor work

915
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,240
so the dispatch working groups are very

916
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,800
useful for bringing on new work

917
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,359
you can always do a buff proposal that's

918
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,440
a little more complicated

919
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,760
but you can prepare some drafts prepare

920
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,560
a charter come up with an agenda and

921
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,040
then discuss with an area director

922
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,720
getting that on the agenda for the next

923
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,118
meeting

924
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,040
and there's a lovely tutorial which

925
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,800
we've got the url at the bottom

926
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,560
including a video

927
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,839
of bringing new work to the ietf

928
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,119
please do have a look at those

929
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,880
so

930
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,640
let's talk about some resources that

931
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,160
you're going to be able to

932
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,640
use here in the ietf

933
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,400
first of all

934
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,520
all of the rest of the participants

935
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,920
the ietf tends to be a group of

936
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,480
engineers who are rather passionate and

937
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,880
smart and vocal about the things that

938
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,359
they're working on this can be a little

939
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,760
intimidating at first people get up to

940
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,160
the mic and say no when you know we've

941
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,680
been talking about this forever and we

942
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,680
should go this way or that way people

943
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,880
get very

944
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,800
excited about work

945
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,599
don't worry too much about getting a

946
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,520
conversation going with such folks

947
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,119
they'll be glad to talk to you about the

948
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,520
topic

949
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,960
don't be shy

950
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,680
it's a hard group to be shy with

951
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,800
they're very engaging

952
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,000
technical excellence is sort of the

953
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,280
key

954
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,640
point as far as ietf goes

955
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,040
we're looking to build the best

956
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,400
protocols

957
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,599
and so

958
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,119
we tend to

959
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,920
frown on wheeling and dealing and i'll

960
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
give you my protocol if you you know

961
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,720
give me yours etc and so forth

962
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,160
um again please do your homework

963
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,319
bringing up ideas that have been

964
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,319
discussed ad nauseum

965
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,160
sometimes people

966
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,640
uh aren't very impressed with that so do

967
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,319
read up on the documents but once you've

968
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,240
read up on the documents bring up

969
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,200
questions people want to hear them

970
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,960
you'll also notice that

971
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,640
a lot of folks have been around here for

972
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,160
a very long time and so there are some

973
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,839
close relationships

974
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,599
lots of people hugging in the hall this

975
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,000
week well those of us with our little

976
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,680
green markers on

977
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,960
um but everybody is willing to chat

978
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,040
but sometimes it feels a little hard to

979
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,440
break into a conversation after a

980
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,040
session meet up with some people in the

981
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,200
hallway and chat with them

982
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,799
that's a good way to get to know people

983
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,800
don't be shy about walking up to chairs

984
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,839
and area directors

985
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,440
everybody should be happy to talk to you

986
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,200
about any of the topics in their

987
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,599
particular area there's a list of

988
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,680
working group chairs on the website on

989
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,760
the data tracker website by the way the

990
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,720
data tracker is sort of our home base

991
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,400
that's where all of the documents go

992
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,680
that's where all of the working group

993
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,319
charters go a very good resource you

994
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,680
should go hunting around on there and

995
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,280
see what's there

996
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,000
so the chairs go to working group chairs

997
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,760
ask questions about how to get involved

998
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,319
in things

999
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,200
the area directors are also listed up on

1000
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,520
the ietf website

1001
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,119
for both the chairs and the area

1002
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,599
directors there are photos you can spot

1003
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,119
people in the hall although it's harder

1004
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,560
with the masks

1005
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,760
um

1006
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,680
i one of the

1007
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,920
folks that i've known for years was

1008
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,520
almost unrecognizable because they

1009
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,880
couldn't wear their glasses because they

1010
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,440
were fogging up and they had the mask on

1011
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,160
i

1012
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,160
was shocked to find out who it was um

1013
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,079
and lars our ietf chair is always happy

1014
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,720
to chat he does tend to run about and

1015
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
have this meeting or that meeting so

1016
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
sometimes he's hard to pin down for too

1017
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,520
long but he's rather friendly and

1018

1100
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,440

1105
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,560

um

1112
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,839
they are only somewhat useful

1113
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,839
particularly the blue dot for the chairs

1114
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,200
because there's a lot of chairs running

1115
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,560
around and you don't know for which

1116
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,119
group they may be the chair so i've got

1117

1187
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
your home base

1188
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,240
data tracker has all of the information

1189
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,640
you need to read documents to see the

1195
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,440
tools page is slowly being migrated over

1196
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,440
to data tracker so there's not too much

1197
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,119
out there anymore

1198
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,480

1199
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,880
meet echo is our online meeting

1200
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,280

information on

1207
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,440
meat echo and on where the recordings

1208
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,079
are archived of each of the sessions

1209
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,559
there's also some places to try out to

1210
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,559
test the tool if you're

1211
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,480
wanting to play with it ahead of time

1212
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,640
gather is great if you are online

1213
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,240
um i

1214
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,839
i don't know why more people don't use

1215
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,160
it but it actually is

1216
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,920
you get a little icon to run around the

1217
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,680
rooms with which is

1218
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,240
i guess fun for some people i don't even

1219
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,240
care to have my little icon and i don't

1220
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,319
need that sort of thing but what happens

1221
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,240
is if your icon gets next to another

1222
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,640
person's icon your video comes on you

1223
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,160
can chat with them

1224
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,480
and especially when i was online this

1225
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,720
was a great tool to go running around

1226
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,319
the hall and go oh i need to meet up

1227

with my friend alexi he's over there and

1228
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,760

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,640
chat with some of the online people

1233
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,000
there are more of them than there are of

1234
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,800
us here in the room

1235

um

1236
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,520
we tend to run our own networks at these

1237
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,960
meetings

1238
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,520

1244
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,079

1250
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,040
meeting.ietf.org has all of the network

1251
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,160
information

1252
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,079
of what's available and also tells you

1253

where to go to get help so ignore this

1254
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,480
slide look at that link

1255
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,040
yes i'll try and update the

1256
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,240
the slides

1257
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,520
um

1258
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,800
in any event

1259
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,680
uh

1260
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,319
yeah we tend to run our own networks at

1261
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,960
these meetings uh hotels have had loads

1262
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,880
of fun over the years where they used to

1263
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,200
say oh don't worry about it we'll take

1264
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,200
care of it we've got a great network

1265
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,920
here at the hotel and all the ietf's

1266
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,599
show up and the network collapses within

1267
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,520
minutes

1268
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,040
so there are many hotels around the

1269
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,880
world that have had

1270
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,800
probably millions of dollars in free

1271
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,559
consulting as we reconfigured all their

1272
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,960
routers and wireless access points for

1273
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,480
them and

1274
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,559
generally we bring in our own back hall

1275
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,280
and

1276
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,559
run the network

1277
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,760
ietf hotel network is usually the one

1278
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,119
where we hook up to their access points

1279
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,040
and just plug them into our back hall

1280
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,440
so yeah we have a very good network set

1281
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,520
up here

1282
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,119
uh key one is try to use the ietf

1283
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,760
uh secure networks don't use the iatf

1284
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,240
legacy ones

1285
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,040
um

1286
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,240
jabber the xmpp protocol

1287
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,200
uh

1288
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,760
we still use to a great extent the meat

1289
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,960
echo chats are actually a jabber chat

1290
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,960
so if you use jabber and you want to get

1291
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,960
to the ietf meeting rooms there are

1292
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,280
pointers on each of the agenda items

1293
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,680
page to show you how to get in to the

1294
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,599
chat room or when you're logged in to

1295
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,559
meet fo you can just see the chat

1296
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,040
do note that in meet echo the chat

1297
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,440
window you there's a little button to

1298
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,520
separate it out so you can continue to

1299
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,680
watch the meeting and the participants

1300
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,319
and have the chat separate

1301
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,240
which is kind of handy

1302
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,839
and there's a little how-to page on how

1303
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,839
to use it

1304
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,480
please do participate and there's lots

1305
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,079
of background

1306
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,000
discussion during meetings where people

1307
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,200
don't want to get up to the mic because

1308
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,839
it's either a small topic or just some

1309
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,680
side commentary

1310
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,520
it's very useful to read the jabra chat

1311
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,240
during the meeting

1312
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,079
and above all

1313
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,760
enjoy yourself

1314
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,240

1318
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,520

1319
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,319

nice to see you and uh i have a question

1342
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,319
to to ask

1343
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,119
it's about the patent and

1344
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,559
when should i public the patent document

1345
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,359
because sometimes the patenter is still

1346
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,359
in application in the process of of

1347
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,400
application

1348
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,119
it's not been uh authorized so we should

1349
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,040
publish the

1350
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,119
should i inform the working group that

1351
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,200
there is a potential patent in the

1352
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,559
document

1353
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,280
so

1354
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,760
the the short answer to the question is

1355
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,559
as soon as possible

1356
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,119
and if you read over the patent policy

1357
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,680
which is bcp 79

1358
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,880
and the rfcs are there it describes when

1359
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,520
you're when you have to do that

1360
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,200
um

1361
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,440
but it goes through when you are

1362
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,280
individually aware

1363
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,200
that this is going to

1364
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,960
uh you know impose on the work and

1365
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,119
you're participating in a working group

1366
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,720
you really have to

1367
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,200
make a disclosure as soon as you can we

1368
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,480
understand that

1369
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,680
lots of us work for companies that have

1370
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,400
particular policies on how to

1371
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,160
do those disclosures

1372
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,040
sometimes lawyers have to do the actual

1373
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,359
written disclosure

1374
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,760
but even during a working group session

1375
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,000
you're participating in saying hey just

1376
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,119
to let you know i think we're going to

1377
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,760
be making a formal disclosure soon is

1378
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,839
useful

1379
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,799
but

1380
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,960
do check out the rules in the bcp that

1381
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,040
will give you more details and you can

1382
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,119
show your if you have attorneys for your

1383
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,799
company you can show them

1384
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,920
uh what the request is and they'll

1385
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,480
understand all the details

1386
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,520
okay thank you uh another question so

1387
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,520
what's the consequence of some uh

1388
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,400
company or some other people use rfc

1389
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,200
with

1390
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,680
with patent

1391
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,000
say that again i'm sorry

1392
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,240
so what's the consequence of other

1393
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,000
people what's the problem of other

1394
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,040
people that use uh rfc with with some

1395
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,440
patents

1396
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,240
i and

1397
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,640
what is the problem with people using

1398
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,559
rfcs with the patents

1399
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,720
yes yes

1400
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,879
i

1401
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,599
i'm not sure what you mean

1402
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,520
could you explain i mean

1403
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,760
yeah i mean if rfc is is protected by

1404
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,260
and

1405
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,520
[Music]

1406
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,920
how about how other companies will use

1407
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,119
it

1408
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,960
oh so

1409
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,480
um

1410
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,240
at the ietf

1411
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,720
there is no requirement

1412
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,480
for a patent holder to actually license

1413
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,079
the material

1414
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,920
that's in the rfc

1415
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,480
so we've got um rfcs that have been

1416
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,559
published that have patented material in

1417
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,880
them um and

1418
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,640
that's between the patent holder and the

1419
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,839
person who implements the rfc so unlike

1420
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,920
some standards organizations we do not

1421
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,799
have a policy that you must give

1422
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,440
up uh you know a release to your patents

1423
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,680
or anything like that so

1424
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,720
for us that's between the patent holder

1425
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,920
and

1426
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,040
um the person who's implementing

1427
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,319
um

1428
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,960
so that's why we like the disclosures is

1429
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,559
so that the working group when they're

1430
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,040
producing their document can make a

1431
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,599
decision oh this has patented materials

1432
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,280
do we want to put this in the standard

1433
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,799
or not

1434
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,720
um but because we participate as

1435
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,160
individuals

1436
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,359
uh you know unless you personally

1437
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,599
have knowledge of the patent

1438
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,920
and want to discuss that in the ietf

1439
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,920
which is good

1440
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,480
the decision on whether to use the rfc

1441
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,599
if it's got patent patented material is

1442
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,200
a discussion between the patent holder

1443
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,599
and the person doing the implementation

1444
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,200
again okay thank you

1445
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,359
let me be clear just in case there is a

1446
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,319
question i am not a lawyer

1447
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:06,160
um and so you do want to consult with

1448
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,720
the documents in bcp 79 so that you

1449
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,440
understand what the implications are

1450
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,799
okay thank you

1451
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,720
of course

1452
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,680
um

1453
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,119
thank you uh hansjorg

1454
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:20,640
if you want to turn on your video that's

1455
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,559
appreciated but you don't have to

1456
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:23,920
oh he's you're in the room please come

1457
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,300
up to the microphone

1458
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,559
[Laughter]

1459
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,559
it's hard to tell on here because you

1460
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,640
have the little i'm at home icon because

1461
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,480
you're logged into the full

1462
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,160
thing that's fine welcome please thanks

1463
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,280
for the confusion

1464
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,839
no no worries um so my question is what

1465
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,240
is the essential or recommended tooling

1466
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,480
uh for that week especially for being

1467
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,720
on-site so i saw there is the agenda app

1468
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,440
which is now updated i think it was yes

1469
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,680
and um so should i install jabba on my

1470
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,359
mobile ah

1471
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:54,960
so um

1472
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,960
yeah for the chats

1473
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,000
um it's probably you can install a jabra

1474
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,079
client that's fine but

1475
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,920
since most of the work that you're going

1476
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,880
to be doing is in working group sessions

1477
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,799
uh meat echo

1478
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,400
does have the chat window in it and

1479
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,200
that's hooked into the jabber so i would

1480
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,040
just simply use meat echo during the

1481
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,799
sessions

1482
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,119
you may eventually decide that you want

1483
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,880
to do a full jabber client so that you

1484
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,359
can talk to people between meetings

1485
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,559
um and and such but for this week

1486
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,240
using meat echo alone is probably

1487
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,359
sufficient

1488
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,200
okay so there's no more stuff you don't

1489
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,599
need to use a regular jabber client um

1490
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,680
you will notice that the thin client the

1491
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,839
one that runs on the mobiles that just

1492
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,200
checks you in and allows you to raise

1493
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,839
your hand doesn't have the jabber

1494
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,839
client in there so if you just want to

1495
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,599
use it on your phone you may need to do

1496
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:46,400
that

1497
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
to get a jabra client but if you're

1498
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,240
going to use the regular jabber on your

1499
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,880
laptop uh the regular meet echo on your

1500
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,720
laptop that is uh that will have the

1501
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,119
jabra built in okay but also beyond

1502
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,280
yeah is there anything else oh or for

1503
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,160
participation there are no other uh

1504
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,680
the gather

1505
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,640
town

1506
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,040
uh so you can talk to other people

1507
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,440
online is the only other tool that we

1508
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,319
use

1509
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,079
on a regular basis i'm trying to think

1510
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,559
karen is there any others that

1511
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,960
come to mind

1512
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,799
uh no there's no others that come to

1513
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,480
mind and one thing i did want to mention

1514
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,119
was there is an effort to

1515
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,000
migrate away from jabber to a new iatf

1516
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,400
chat client in the future

1517
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,040
so i don't know how much energy i would

1518
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,880
invest in that separate jabber client

1519
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,880
and everything else is just logging into

1520
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
the webpage on the data tracker looking

1521
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,319
through the agenda and all that stuff

1522
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,200
that will point you in the right

1523
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,160
