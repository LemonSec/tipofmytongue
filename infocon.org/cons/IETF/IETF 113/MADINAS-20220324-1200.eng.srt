afternoon everyone i'll say good

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,400
afternoon because it's in a time

139
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
although it's morning for me too so um

140
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,319
what i would like to do in this uh

141
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,160
section is to give you an update on this

142
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,319
use case document you if you are

143
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,319
familiar with marinas you may remember

144
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,840
that we've been discussing this document

145
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
a lot

146
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,639
um the um context of these documents

147
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,759
here if i can strain the slides right um

148
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,000
is that we've been trying to organize

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,880
our thoughts around the idea of rcm and

150
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
the use cases behind rcm and what it

151
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
might be breaking

152
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
um if you want to follow along the

153
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,000
document is at the link that is

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
available at the top of the slide um and

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,880
we realized that in in many cases uh

156
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,960
with the conversations where often

157
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
people pass each other and that's

158
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
because um

159
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,039
there are multiple environmental

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,479
constraints and variables that people

161
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,160
were referring to and they were not

162
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,240
always referring to the same ones

163
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,560
for example we say they are spying on

164
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,919
your

165
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,720
personal information their pii they who

166
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,680
is they um what pii are we talking about

167
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,840
so what in this document we are trying

168
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,560
to organize um the different use cases

169
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,400
and different environments where

170
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
rcm might be affected so we start in

171
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,879
this document by defining the device

172
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,400
side by saying well there are different

173
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,199
types of devices and here we use the

174
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,160
ieee definitions and the iso definition

175
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,759
where we recognize that there are

176
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,080
personal devices devices that typically

177
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,400
belong for to a small group of person

178
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
and there are shared devices

179
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,479
that associate devices that

180
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,440
are used by a large number of people and

181
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,199
whereby of course the activity of those

182
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,520
devices is not necessarily reflective of

183
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,280
activity of a single user on these

184
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,160
devices for example a switch in

185
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,280
enterprise

186
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,000
and also we try to understand who are

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,759
they you know these different actors

188
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,160
that may be involved in this exchange

189
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
with infrastructure and the internet

190
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,080
starting from the user device so we

191
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,160
recognize that there are some network

192
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,319
entities that say objects for example

193
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,958
that is your wi-fi access point your

194
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,880
wireless lan controller your switches

195
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,279
your routers you know all these devices

196
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,360
may have a view of the device mac

197
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,159
address as traffic transit through them

198
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,919
but there are also some human related

199
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,920
entities uh and that could be you know

200
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,360
multiple people of course it could be

201
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,760
the user but it could be also the it's

202
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
supporting an enterprise that could be

203
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,040
um the

204
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
entity managing the wi-fi at your

205
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,680
airport etc so each of these will have a

206
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
different type of interaction with the

207
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
device's information and of course with

208
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,959
the mac address

209
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,880
we also recognize that

210
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,279
not every environment is the same and

211
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,120
not every user has the same relationship

212
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,600
with the environment so we come to

213
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,080
define what we call the trust level

214
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
where we say there are places where

215
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,040
probably a device and its user will not

216
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,399
trust any

217
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
device or any actor in the environment

218
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,760
typically public wi-fi guest wi-fi

219
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,600
you will not trust anything there are

220
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,519
some other environments where the trust

221
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,920
might be more towards the

222
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
partial trust where you may be trusting

223
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
some of these elements but not all of

224
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
them for example if you are in

225
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,680
enterprise network with device provided

226
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,920
by your enterprise it is likely that you

227
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,640
might be trusting you know the network

228
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,120
wire network section of the

229
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
enterprise because all that is manage

230
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,360
your device and the network you may not

231
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,440
trust you know the air and people

232
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
sniffing around but you may be trusting

233
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
you know the services provided by the

234
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
device to the device by the environment

235
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,560
et cetera

236
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
and then we go on by listing the

237
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
entities among all of those

238
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,200
that may have a need or an interest in

239
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,760
tracking uh mac addresses so that is of

240
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
course you know anything that is a

241
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
functional entity that needs the mac

242
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
address to proceed uh through

243
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
communication exchanges but of course

244
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
there are some um entities which are

245
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,040
human entities that rely on the mac

246
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
address for different purposes like

247
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
troubleshooting tracking or legal

248
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,279
tracking etc so we list all these

249
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,720
elements and then we finish these

250
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,399
documents by you know listing the

251
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,320
assumptions and again i i bring you back

252
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,560
to the document um to to these

253
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
assumptions about the fact that you know

254
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
a network element should not nor rely on

255
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,079
the id that is a unique mac address

256
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
association to a device that would be

257
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,760
permanent etc so again i'm just browsing

258
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,360
through this draft fairly quickly

259
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,800
because i know we've been discussing it

260
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
extensively

261
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,720
in the current version of the draft you

262
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,920
may remember that before its adoption to

263
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
the martinez group we had a conversation

264
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
about this draft extensively and the

265
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,200
last one was in the meeting prior to

266
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,519
the vote by which the group decided to

267
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,560
adopt it so after the vote to adopt this

268
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,800
document was passed we brought we

269
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
changed the name of the document and

270
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
brought it from the henry something

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,399
version three if i recall into the draft

272
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,360
ietf madinas use case version zero uh

273
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,040
which is you know the same document as

274
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,000
this henry v3 document but brought into

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
the ownership of of the magnets group

276
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,800
and then immediately after we started

277
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,000
implementing in v1 uh the commands that

278
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,839
we received in the face-to-face where it

279
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,360
was designed and voted that we would

280
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,519
adopt this document so currently the

281
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,200
version that you will see in these

282
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
documents is

283
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,440
version one of the marinas use case

284
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
document and of course as usual this is

285
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,360
a working document so

286
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
any feedback any

287
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,720
reading any comment is very welcome

288
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
this document of course is a living

289
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,399
document we're intending to work with it

290
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,279
to improve it um and among the things

291
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
that we think we could do uh one of them

292
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
is to

293
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
match this document's evolution with the

294
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,560
charter of the group and that includes

295
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,120
for example uh survey the current

296
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,600
standards uh and their use of the mac

297
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,760
address as a device identifier in the

298
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,720
protocol um we'll have a quick read in

299
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
about half an hour i think on what

300
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,760
happens at the ieee in the 802.11 group

301
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,279
um but it's likely that there are some

302
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,000
other groups and other sdos um that

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
could be interesting to us

304
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,680
once we have this reading

305
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,519
it could be interesting for us also to

306
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
come to conclusions on whether we see

307
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,079
that the usage is a conformant to what

308
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,200
we think

309
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,160
should be

310
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
the right balance between operational

311
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,360
efficiency and and privacy so we could

312
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,880
also make some recommendations to the

313
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,959
working groups you know to remove those

314
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
dependencies if there are any

315
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
of course we will likely identify that

316
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,519
there are some scenarios where we will

317
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,920
not want uh these devices to be

318
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,240
identified by anything in which case you

319
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,600
know rotation of mac address is

320
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,519
something that we'll be uh probably uh

321
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,959
suggesting or recommending and we'll be

322
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,040
examining what protocols

323
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,800
can be

324
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
affected by the rotation of the mac

325
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,040
address there will also be likely some

326
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
scenarios or environments where we will

327
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,760
identify that it might be useful for the

328
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,920
user experience and for the continuity

329
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,560
of service that an id that identifier

330
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,639
would be exchanged between the

331
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,279
device and you know the target service

332
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,200
in that case we'll probably we need to

333
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
come through the different centers and

334
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,279
see if there are some identifiers that

335
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,560
could be used

336
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,480
that could be replacing what has been

337
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,639
used today which is the mac address and

338
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,120
you know as we identify those mechanisms

339
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,199
um we might be

340
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,440
suggesting some existing mechanism one

341
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,040
that comes to mind and that's the third

342
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,120
that you see here for example

343
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,320
being an eight to 11 person um is that

344
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,839
there could also be value to in

345
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,079
inform the station about what kind of

346
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,560
environment it is in uh for example in

347
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,480
1811 2011 there's a table called table

348
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,000
966

349
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,120
which is defined in the anqp section of

350
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,519
the document that defines venue

351
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,120
and it says you know the access point

352
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
can express what kind of venue this

353
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,880
device is in and you can say it's very

354
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
expensive it has more than 70 types of

355
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,839
venues

356
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,720
from automotive to a boat to an airport

357
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,040
etc so that could be

358
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,399
information that could for example be

359
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,000
sent to the station to help the station

360
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
assess if it may

361
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,680
decide to start trusting some of the

362
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,519
services or not knowing that this

363
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,199
information of course is not secured

364
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,120
it's not authenticated until the

365
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
association is complete so there are all

366
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,160
sort of environmental conditions that

367
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,240
we'll need to uh to think about but you

368
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,360
know that kind of exchange of

369
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,079
information between the venue elements

370
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,839
related services that the station may

371
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,079
need and the station

372
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,240
may help the station decide what to do

373
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,800
and what kind of environments

374
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,240
it might it might be operating and

375
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,320
therefore make choices in terms of

376
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,959
obfuscating further its identity or

377
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,279
revealing some identifier

378
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,440
to some services that it decides needs

379
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,399
to be

380
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,680
continuous

381
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,839
through the mac rotation so that you

382
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,600
know could be an identity of course to

383
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,399
the network or to specific services and

384
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,639
of course in that same line it could

385
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,120
also be um the idea of informing the

386
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
service before the mac address changes

387
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
if we identify as we come through those

388
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,519
uh standards that you know there is a

389
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,600
dependency on the mac address

390
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
so among all these steps uh the first

391
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,160
one to me is probably one where we have

392
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,240
most urgency and a lot of work to do

393
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,839
because you know i'm an eight to 11

394
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,920
person um my knowledge of the uh now now

395
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,000
close to nine thousand um itf rfcs is

396
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,160
more limited i don't know the 9000 by

397
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,120
hearts

398
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,720
so you know it would be interesting for

399
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,560
us to look into those standards you know

400
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,959
outside of the itf but also within itf

401
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,120
uh to know which ones use the mac

402
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,440
address as a device identifier and

403
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,839
possibly make the expectation

404
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,800
that the device itself is identified by

405
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,160
its mac address

406
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,480
you know few rfcs that come to mind

407
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,959
would be those related to protocols like

408
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,680
dhcp for example it seems to me that in

409
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,279
the choreography

410
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,079
the initial identifier of the station as

411
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
far as layer 3 goes is a 0 0 0 if it's

412
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,160
ipv4

413
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
and then you know the address is going

414
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,639
to be the mac address to and from

415
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,880
the dhcp server and then once the ip

416
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,800
address has been assigned and allocated

417
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,639
and accepted by the station

418
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,000
um it uh

419
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,959
it's um

420
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,800
it seems to me that most of the time the

421
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,480
station is going to be identified in the

422
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,360
dhcp server by its mac address and its

423
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,680
association to the ip address so that

424
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,440
could be a first you know element that

425
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,800
comes to mind but again i'm not an

426
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,519
expert in these rfcs you know

427
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,519
those of you on this uh this calling in

428
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,639
this room

429
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,240
have more expertise there may help us

430
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,000
identify those uh protocols and what

431
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,680
kind of dependencies assume are not

432
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,600
assumed and also are there some

433
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
identifiers uh that could be replacing

434
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,519
the mac address in those another one of

435
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,120
course is anything which uh relates to

436
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,119
to the 11 process of attaching to an

437
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,160
access point and that is include a heap

438
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,039
that includes radius um and no problem

439
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,480
for the other so

440
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,799
if you know of any

441
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,520
protocol or standards or rfcs where you

442
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,679
think the mac address may play a role in

443
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,359
the identification of the device you

444
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,720
know i would like to call you to come

445
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,919
forward and

446
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,400
post to the list or talk to us you know

447
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
help us identify

448
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
um those uh those protocols so we can

449
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,720
start in this draft listing them and you

450
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,120
know listing and documenting how

451
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,200
they expect the mac address to be used

452
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,880
and of course you know this is true at

453
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
the itf this is true of course elsewhere

454
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,840
um you know by the ieee 11 we have some

455
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,600
familiarity um i'm sure

456
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
that they're i'm not going to be able to

457
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,919
identify all by myself everything that

458
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,400
is done in 82.11 for example which is

459
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,880
close to 6000 pages so far but there are

460
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
also some other you know sdos you know

461
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,160
idea triple itself a22.1 for example and

462
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
of course 802.1x you know all the

463
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,919
association for radius um but also uh uh

464
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,120
other other uh sdos like the wba for

465
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,440
example the wi-fi alliance and

466
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,840
and many others that i don't uh think of

467
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,400
so please if you have any uh willingness

468
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,080
to contribute

469
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,400
help us identify those please help us

470
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
you know by maybe uh listing how you see

471
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,600
uh documenting how you see those

472
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,919
mac addresses be used or if it's you

473
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,000
know just too much of a read please just

474
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
share you know rfc numbers protocol

475
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,799
numbers uh in the chat uh in the chat in

476
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,799
the in the list and you know let's start

477
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,120
together exchanging on those and come

478
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,400
through this the

479
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,840
practice of the industry today to

480
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,000
identify where mac addresses are needed

481
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,600
and see if we can you know continue

482
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,520
operating services without those mac

483
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,200
addresses

484
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,160
let me

485
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,039
pause

486
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,440
there to see if there are any

487
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,240
questions or any any comments

488
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,760
yes we have carlos in the queue

489
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,840
yeah carlo bernardo's question as an

490
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,960
individual

491
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
all right a comment is on this point

492
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,919
about the identifying what protocols use

493
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,880
the the mac address as an identifier

494
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,600
i wonder if there is any way of where we

495
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
can do this as a more

496
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,799
uh

497
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,880
i don't i don't know how to say a way

498
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
that we ensure we don't miss any because

499
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,440
i guess there will be many potential

500
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,679
protocols out there that may use the mac

501
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,679
address random i mean the manga is as an

502
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,960
identifier

503
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
i just thinking of for example mobility

504
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,200
protocols there are a lot that come to

505
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
my mind that

506
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,919
mac addresses may be one of the

507
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,280
identifiers that they can use it's not

508
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,960
the only one but maybe

509
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
so i wonder if there is anything that we

510
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,679
can do to make this in a more organized

511
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,440
way maybe

512
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,600
asking feedback from other

513
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,200
working groups i don't know how to do it

514
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,120
to ensure that we don't miss any

515
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
because i don't know if this button up

516
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,760
approach

517
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,200
may

518
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
may

519
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,760
we may miss some i don't know

520
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
this is a question for

521
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,320
us to to think about

522
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
yes thank you very much carlos and in

523
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,280
fact i think we should do both you're

524
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,000
right uh i think a liaison and we have

525
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,520
such things our questions to the other

526
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,640
seos

527
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,440
would be a great way to to help us i did

528
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,080
a fun exercise the other day i

529
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,880
got went to dr go and search for mac

530
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,600
address with the site ietf.org

531
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,640
i found only 200 000 references

532
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,280
so just that tells me that

533
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,360
it probably would be useful

534
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,000
even within the ietf

535
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,520
to maybe query

536
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,360
experts in some groups or the groups

537
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,039
themselves if we have such communication

538
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,960
medium uh to ask them to help us so yeah

539
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,080
working both uh way up bottom up and top

540
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,919
down yeah thank you

541
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,039
okay

542
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,720
thank you i saw someone else approaching

543
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
the mic but i'm not sure

544
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,240
yeah well we had people here in the

545
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
queue on the virtual queue that's how we

546
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,880
will manage it now so next one next in

547
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,080
line is bob maskovich

548
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,000
here

549
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,240
and i am the uh

550
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,640
pretty much the lead technical

551
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
contributor to the drip working group

552
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,400
and where we're dealing with unmanned

553
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,520
aircraft and right now we're focusing on

554
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,240
what's called the broadcast remote id

555
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,080
these are messages which are sent with

556
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,720
broadcast frames to receive by by

557
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
observers on the ground

558
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,120
so these are sent through the various

559
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,280
broadcast frames in bluetooth 4

560
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,440
bluetooth 5 or wi-fi nan or wi-fi

561
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,159
beacons the observer can only see these

562
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,000
messages maybe for a brief period of

563
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,720
time to need to link them together

564
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,159
this standard has been written and

565
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,080
designed to use mac addresses

566
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,120
particularly bluetooth 4 we only have 27

567
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,480
bytes of payload so anything to do has

568
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,840
to be linked by via mac addresses

569
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,159
in terms of the uas themselves they

570
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,600
pretty much are

571
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,760
consistent on at least using the same

572
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,640
mac address per quote operation which

573
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,559
you would call per flight

574
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,320
the problem of course comes at some of

575
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,000
the clients particularly apple

576
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,679
randomizes the mac address that they

577
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,480
intercept to feed up to the application

578
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,919
so the application won't know it's

579
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,320
really sent and that breaks the

580
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,480
application severely where the

581
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,559
application needs to know what those mac

582
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,120
addresses are to be able to link the

583
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,520
streaming message together while that ua

584
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,159
is observable overhead um so this is

585
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,039
particularly a challenge in this one

586
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,720
particular use case which uh considering

587
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,600
what the rollout for unmanned aircraft

588
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,080
is expected over the next 10 years is

589
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,439
really an important use case

590
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,960
thank you rob

591
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,720
yeah i think this is uh yeah interesting

592
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,520
case and i i'm i'm fairly convinced it's

593
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,200
a side effect that wasn't envisioned by

594
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,720
the vendor you

595
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,559
you your name

596
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,360
would you mind posting references to

597
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,679
this standard in india to the reflector

598
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,200
i would be very interested to start

599
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,280
looking into that yes i don't think i'm

600
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
on madness right now um

601
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,840
so like i said i've been remiss these

602
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
this past period time not not getting

603
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,760
active

604
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,360
and and you gentlemen know me from from

605
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,559
various uh places so i will um

606
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,159
step up my game

607
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,520
and and get active here with you and uh

608
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,919
um adam whittaker is also on this this

609
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,480
session uh who's one of my co-authors

610
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,960
and and we'll we'll uh start pitching in

611
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
here to make sure that uh it's covered

612
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,960
um in your work because uh um

613
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,080
we are limited with remote id and what

614
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,960
we can do and how long that ua may be

615
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,279
visible in your airspace

616
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,200
yeah indeed all right thank you much

617
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,640
appreciate it thank you

618
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
thank you okay thank you

619
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,520
next time is tim hey don't tim hey

620
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,080
jerome um so on the i'm not sure about

621
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,159
all the tooling across the stos but at a

622
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,120
minimum i think we should be able to

623
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,600
de-reference the mac address right if

624
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,279
people did normally reference it and

625
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,880
pull all the specs that mentioned it i

626
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,480
mean i don't know that might be an easy

627
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
way to get a bunch

628
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
on the use cases uh looks awesome the

629
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,840
one thing i would say is across these

630
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,279
docks i would avoid mdm versus byod

631
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,760
i would say managed unmanaged

632
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,679
just there's too much

633
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,960
too much ambiguity and it means

634
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,559
different things from people managed is

635
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,039
very concrete

636
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,640
yeah thank you very much tim yeah well

637
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,200
taken i'll i'll make the change

638
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,120
thank you very much tim

639
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
next is michael

640
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,200
hi i don't get a lot of i don't get any

641
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,360
wi-fi in this room right now

642
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,120
so it's kind of hard to get in the queue

643
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,080
um

644
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,760
so uh michael richardson mike um so

645
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,559
what

646
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,440
what is the point of of

647
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,720
dereferencing all these uses um

648
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,200
i'm not sure that there's any like i

649
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,799
don't know what the cost of missing a

650
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,480
protocol is in this because i don't know

651
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,760
what we're going to do with this list at

652
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,120
the end of the day

653
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
and i think that's um

654
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,120
actually more important discussion to

655
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,960
have than how to get you know all the

656
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,279
references is what is the goal of doing

657
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,720
this

658
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,279
and i think bob actually brings up

659
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,640
actually the more important point

660
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,159
apple is

661
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,000
removing those mac addresses so that

662
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,919
nefarious apps can't

663
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,240
you know watch where you are and what's

664
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,279
going on

665
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,559
and yet

666
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,679
okay

667
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,480
um that's for your own privacy benefit

668
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,520
and yet bob is writing an application

669
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,120
whose purpose is to find out who's

670
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,440
spying on you with their drone

671
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,279
right which is clearly a much bigger

672
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,559
privacy impact than uh the other part

673
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,480
so i think that that

674
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
um what i think we're doing in this

675
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,360
group i think we're going to be

676
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,440
trying to write down

677
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,159
the set of compromises

678
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,000
where

679
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,240
uh randomize and changing mac address is

680
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,159
a good idea

681
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,279
and

682
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,760
where it's a bad idea

683
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
and then in fact it may be privacy

684
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
violating to do that

685
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,520
uh rather than uh so i don't think it

686
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,039
our goal should be

687
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,120
how can we remove mac addresses from

688
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,159
being the primary key of databases

689
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,520
everywhere

690
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,440
but rather to say

691
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,919
these uses are clearly privacy violating

692
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,240
and you should do something else

693
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,679
and these other users are going to have

694
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,840
to the second category well you're going

695
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,520
to have to do some correlation after the

696
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,400
fact

697
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,679
and the third category is

698
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,440
my refrigerator just isn't going

699
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,520
anywhere i really don't care what mac

700
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
address it uses it's always going to be

701
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,720
in my house

702
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
and it's not going to starbucks and

703
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
that's really it right

704
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,279
it's a moot point at the same time i

705
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,120
really need to know my mac address of my

706
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,840
fridge because i'm pretty sure

707
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,000
it's never getting a softer update

708
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,520
and i need to defend it okay

709
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,120
yeah i i'd like to well uh answer just

710
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,240
to to

711
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,480
your point about the purpose because i

712
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,640
think that touches on the on the group's

713
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,760
chart there

714
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
and and i think indeed what what you

715
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,080
mentioned is is the end goal so it's not

716
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,520
to say let's randomize but rather given

717
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,120
the fact that randomizing mac addresses

718
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,320
is happening

719
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,640
uh we want to list all these use cases

720
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,559
and you just went through a

721
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,480
few of them that are very relevant we

722
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
want to make sure that we capture

723
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,159
in this document

724
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,720
all these use cases plus any other that

725
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,640
people may have we talked about the

726
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,480
hospitality or

727
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,039
private networks public networks etc so

728
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,679
so fair enough and then

729
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,799
once we

730
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,360
categorize those we can say yes in this

731
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,760
case it doesn't make sense in this case

732
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,919
it makes sense to identify

733
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,760
the device

734
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,320
because we want to obtain a service

735
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,520
and the user is willing to

736
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,799
do it so that he can get the service

737
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,200
and then yes now if we do want to

738
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,799
identify the device

739
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,399
is mac addressed the right identifier or

740
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,320
is there any other identifier or is

741
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,640
there a protocol there that

742
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,039
no one has looked at or another protocol

743
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,640
that is actually being deployed right

744
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,360
now

745
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,200
i think that that is the purpose and if

746
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,960
at the end of the day we realize

747
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,720
everything is fine we can just point to

748
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,880
those solutions

749
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,520
if we find out that there is more work

750
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,480
to do

751
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,520
yes then i think we can

752
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,799
raise the question

753
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,840
what do we do

754
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,880
okay so um

755
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,640
i interjected the queue sorry about that

756
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,799
but

757
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,799
if there are no more questions we can

758
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,320
move to the to the next presenter

759
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,080
so thank you very much jerome

760
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,199
don't go up too far

761
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,520
okay

762
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,679
so

763
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,240
okay i think now is

764
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,120
better

765
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,720
so i'm carlos bernardos i'm presenting

766
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,039
the macarthur's randomization

767
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,039
draft on behalf of my co-author juan

768
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,320
carlos amelia

769
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,720
so just a brief introduction because the

770
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,640
the goal of the presentation today is

771
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,039
more about talking about next steps and

772
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,720
specifically about some changes

773
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
potential changes on the table of

774
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,480
contents but well some introduction you

775
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,640
all know privacy is an increasing

776
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,399
concern and

777
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,240
the use of mac address unique mac

778
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,279
address

779
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,720
may lead to some

780
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,200
potential threats and

781
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,960
because of that well

782
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,200
many projects and many os vendors have

783
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,039
started to randomize addresses and and

784
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,880
that also triggers some other efforts in

785
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,320
some research and standardization

786
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,360
communities

787
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,559
about the use of mac address

788
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,240
randomization and this

789
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,640
draft is basically documenting what is

790
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,520
being done in

791
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,720
[Music]

792
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
in those in those areas in those seos

793
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,120
and also in those mobile oss what are

794
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,559
the policies and approaches that are

795
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,159
being used to randomize mac access

796
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,440
so this is the table of the current

797
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,960
table of content of the draft we have

798
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,480
the introduction introduction the

799
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,960
background the activities on the ieee on

800
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,640
the itf

801
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,399
on the wba

802
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,399
and then we have a section on the

803
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,679
current practices of the different oss

804
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,919
focusing a bit more on the mobile oss

805
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,279
but also covering other fixed os's and

806
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,120
that's the section i will i will have a

807
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,840
question at the end on how we basically

808
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,519
manage that particular section we

809
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,840
because we got uh quite comments on the

810
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,120
on the mailing list on this

811
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
so

812
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,880
moving on

813
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,200
in itf well there there's been a

814
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,360
quite a lot of activity related to mac

815
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,519
address randomization we started quite

816
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,880
in itf 91 we were doing uh

817
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,039
some tests and experiments for those

818
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,679
that were there maybe you even tried

819
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,919
the the scripts that we provided to see

820
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,440
what happened when you start to run

821
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,799
domain addresses in a real network

822
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,120
there were also other documents related

823
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,240
to to privacy the use of

824
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,559
different iavs and ipv6 and other things

825
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,120
in dcp the the potential impact of

826
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,399
of using an identifier in the protocol

827
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,519
and then after that well it came that

828
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,919
now randomizes mac address is a default

829
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,799
policy in mobile oss and what there will

830
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,240
be more on that at the end

831
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,720
let's see

832
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,320
that's weird well

833
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,159
anyway there are some activities also at

834
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,600
the ieee

835
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,840
i don't know if if you stop and start

836
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,320
that get fixed anyway

837
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,159
you will see later on on this by jerome

838
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,320
so basically here is just a pointer on

839
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,640
what the denon is gonna be explaining

840
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,080
later on

841
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,080
and then i don't know oh

842
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,240
there is uh also a section in the draft

843
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
about the wba activity there was a run

844
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,399
of alliance uh

845
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,480
look at the at the issues created by

846
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,640
randomizing mac addresses

847
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,200
and there are as there is a document

848
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,960
documenting the use cases

849
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,799
where this is relevant where this make

850
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,000
case cause some some issues and uh

851
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,760
lucid i think is going to present that

852
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,960
next right

853
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,760
from the vba

854
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,159
then the current practices this is an

855
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,720
accept except from the from the draft

856
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,240
about uh what the major mobile oss are

857
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,440
doing today

858
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,480
android starting from version 10 and ios

859
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,559
from version 14. i will not go into the

860
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,200
details but basically we look into how

861
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,679
the randomized mac addresses are created

862
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,080
under which circumstances and and when

863
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,760
they are refreshed whether they are

864
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,000
persistent or non-persistent whether

865
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,440
they change from one network to the

866
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,519
other or they rotate

867
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,480
through

868
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,960
maybe every day or every

869
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,720
sometime these kind of things

870
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,600
and we also did a more elaborated tests

871
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,360
involving also windows 10 and

872
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,720
linux

873
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
and in the latest version of the draft

874
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,960
we also uh added some notes that are

875
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
starting in android 12 there are some

876
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,799
changes compared to what we did in the

877
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,120
previous version in terms of the use of

878
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,000
persistent or non-persistent and uh

879
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,840
other randomization so there are some

880
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,679
few changes some view tweaks

881
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,918
there

882
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,040
regarding the updates version zero zero

883
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,199
its zero zero was the the exactly the

884
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,359
same version that was adopted the one

885
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,520
that was in the working group

886
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,879
adoption call

887
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,159
and in the current version version 01 we

888
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,440
basically addressed some comments that

889
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,760
we receive mainly from from hey salon on

890
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,079
the this android particular

891
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,760
change

892
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,399
and next steps well of course we want to

893
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,480
have more feedback we got already some

894
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,639
feedback and reviews and comments are

895
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,159
very much welcome

896
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,839
and then we have a key question for the

897
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,399
working group to to address that is how

898
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,199
we tackle the feedback about section 7

899
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,320
this os current practices

900
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,159
there were some comments on how to

901
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,839
basically keep this section up to date

902
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,480
whether we should move it on a wiki or

903
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,560
some external

904
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,599
repository somehow that can be updated

905
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,400
even when the this document is published

906
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,720
so there are some options listed here

907
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,640
there are i mean there may be others but

908
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
the the three main ones that uh that we

909
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,160
see is one option is we keep it as it is

910
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,400
option two is we move section

911
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,680
section seven

912
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,119
to an annex

913
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,079
and refer also to an external wiki or

914
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,880
other type of uh uh url or document

915
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,160
repository

916
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,400
where we keep that text updated but we

917
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
still keep like

918
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,880
the picture of what is the status at the

919
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,079
time of

920
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,079
publishing this document

921
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,400
option three is we convert that section

922
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,720
seven in the external reference so there

923
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,359
is no current picture kind of or a

924
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,880
snapshot

925
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,720
of the status in the document and we

926
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,520
refer to some external resource

927
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,440
and there may be other options so this

928
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,760
is the name feedback that we are

929
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,119
requesting to the working group to

930
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,440
consider for the next updates in

931
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,880
addition to of course any other comment

932
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,560
that you may have

933
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,040
so please state any

934
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,880
opinion on this now or on the mailing

935
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,800
list we will appreciate feedback on on

936
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,200
this point

937
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
thanks carlos so

938
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,720
i'm putting myself in the

939
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,400
in the queue

940
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,960
um

941
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,359
[Music]

942
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,240
i personally have a preference for

943
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,320
not option one definitely

944
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,880
and between option two

945
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,960
and three i think it depends on what

946
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,599
what is going to be the actual goal of

947
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,680
the document

948
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,960
the

949
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,440
i like the idea of keeping it dynamic

950
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,720
personally and uh if we are not going to

951
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,440
draw any uh conclusion from this draft

952
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,599
and it's 100 informational

953
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,400
i think it makes sense to to keep it

954
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,320
completely outside and then

955
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,160
rather concentrate on how we can keep

956
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,640
that wiki up to date

957
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,720
the document i think makes

958
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,839
a very good background that

959
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,160
explains people what we're doing and how

960
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,560
we're doing it and what is happening

961
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,880
anywhere else

962
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,680
in the seos but for this specific point

963
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,520
especially because it it will change so

964
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,079
much and time i i i can see that it'll

965
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,480
change a few times from from now until

966
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,760
we publish

967
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,680
so i don't i think it will diminish the

968
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,000
value of the published document if we

969
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,320
take snapshots

970
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,400
so my preference would be to keep it

971
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
completely outside

972
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,599
and uh and point to it

973
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,960
okay i'm i'm finding the way i agree

974
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,040
that option one is probably

975
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,839
the the one that we can discard right up

976
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,040
right now

977
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
and then option three to make make sense

978
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,320
the question i have personal question i

979
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,839
have that is also for feedback for the

980
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,599
community

981
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,359
how is the best way

982
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,599
what is the best

983
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,680
hosting for this type of information

984
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,079
when we talk about a wiki where that we

985
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:58,960
may

986
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,800
should be hosted and these kind of

987
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,320
things i don't know if there is previous

988
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,880
experience in atf on on doing this in

989
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
documents but that would be appreciated

990
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,000
too right cool to know

991
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,160
yeah that's more a procedural thing but

992
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,240
but it's true that it'll be

993
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,640
useful

994
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,640
do you have a comment about this eric or

995
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,480
you will go through the list the queue

996
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,800
sorry no no i'm going into the queue

997
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,160
simply to say

998
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
what i see in other working group

999
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,599
they're using github for the main

1000
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,160
document and that this living document

1001
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,800
in the github under the itf repo to

1002
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,320
ensure a long-term

1003
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,800
lifetime

1004
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,680
okay so if i if i get it right the idea

1005
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,680
will be to if they give up put that

1006
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,119
information right that like a version

1007
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,240
with this

1008
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,520
there okay

1009
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,079
okay thanks okay thanks no we have one

1010
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,599
more question sorry from matthew

1011
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,280
let me keep speaking um just a comment

1012
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,680
regarding uh the table you've just

1013
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,560
presented where you list the operating

1014
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,599
system

1015
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,599
um we already discussed about this issue

1016
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,800
but um so i understand that for ios and

1017
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,960
windows it's more it's rather a

1018
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,119
monolithic system

1019
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,000
but for android and linux

1020
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,520
they are based on components in fact

1021
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,440
it's not the android system that decides

1022
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,960
how the address is handled this is a

1023
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,359
component called the wpa supplicant and

1024
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,240
maybe it's not the only one that is uh

1025
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,200
dealing with that um and the features

1026
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,920
that can be implemented uh in the code

1027
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,760
and also activated

1028
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,520
uh by

1029
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,040
android and also the vendors uh

1030
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,359
are such that's the the way um

1031
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:46,560
erasmization may vary a lot between uh

1032
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,440
the same version uh of androids

1033
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,599
depending on how the vendors decided to

1034
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,560
activate or not some of the features so

1035
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,680
my question is uh maybe we should

1036
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,800
i don't know but mentioned that it's not

1037
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,040
android per se that is doing that but

1038
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,760
refer to the version of the underlying

1039
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,800
software component that is uh managing

1040
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,599
those randomizations

1041
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,520
okay that's that's a good point

1042
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,599
regarding android from what i understood

1043
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,480
uh

1044
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,160
i mean in linux i fully agree linux

1045
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,440
there are many options and you can

1046
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,880
configure everything

1047
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,319
and depends on the distribution that you

1048
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,400
may have and the network you are using

1049
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,000
network manager there are like at least

1050
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,520
three options or four options regarding

1051
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,800
this that you can configure so it's

1052
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,960
really on the user and then if you go

1053
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,400
more low level

1054
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,480
touching the wpa's applicant then you

1055
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,160
can even have more options

1056
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,960
so in linux is true that is more uh user

1057
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,119
driven and there may be variations we

1058
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,359
try to capture in the document but we we

1059
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,160
may

1060
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,760
try to improve that

1061
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,319
the the options so depending on how you

1062
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,280
configure things what you can get

1063
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,240
that for the linux part for the android

1064
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,560
i also be there i think that what we

1065
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,480
tried to put there or we put there is

1066
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,119
basically the official vanilla kind of

1067
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,839
android approach but i guess i'm not an

1068
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,920
expert on that it's true that then the

1069
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,760
user and the on the

1070
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,359
the variations that the

1071
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:09,570
the

1072
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,040
[Music]

1073
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,119
vendors of the mobile phones these

1074
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,880
customizations that they do may change

1075
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,960
the behavior so i guess we should also

1076
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,720
try to say okay this is kind of the

1077
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,119
baseline and these are the options or

1078
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,240
the different things the different

1079
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,160
behaviors that you can also obtain using

1080
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,599
an android or any other os

1081
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,800
okay

1082
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,480
could you make your point in 30 seconds

1083
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,160
yeah yeah i would i would just ask kai

1084
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,359
there's a certain designation that can

1085
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,560
be given to an android device if it's

1086
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,839
certified and that might be worth the

1087
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:36,800
call out because you have to meet a

1088
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,079
certain criteria i think it's gms

1089
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,760
certification

1090
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,800
okay

1091
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,079
okay

1092
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,920
thank you very much

1093
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,880
so

1094
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,359
now we're moving to uh

1095
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,839
luther

1096
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,440
and i'm going to pass you the control

1097
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,078
thank you

1098
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,319
so um

1099
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,880
thank you for letting me present

1100
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,680
uh

1101
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,839
on behalf of the wba

1102
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,839
what i'd like to do is cover what has

1103
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,640
transpired since the last time that we

1104
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,800
spoke in front of this group

1105
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,760
so just as a quick summary

1106
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,440
um let me see how you

1107
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,720
i'm gonna advance yep got it

1108
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,000
so

1109
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,640
when the group was developed or put

1110
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,359
together we had the scope of generating

1111
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,839
a white paper which consisted of

1112
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,599
defining use cases identifying how the

1113
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,599
mac was used within these cases

1114
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,480
with

1115
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,319
you know which was either required or

1116
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,000
need to have

1117
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,040
we

1118
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,760
sought out and identified different

1119
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,720
methods that have made use of the mac

1120
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,440
address and how they need to be

1121
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,920
addressed uh

1122
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,440
to replace the use of of the mac address

1123
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,839
in that we we took all the different

1124
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,560
current solutions we analyzed them and

1125
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,839
we documented them in different facets

1126
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,319
and against the different use cases and

1127
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,640
then we created a section of

1128
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,800
recommendations and how these solutions

1129
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,400
may be used

1130
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,720
then what we did was we examined the

1131
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,960
gaps between these solutions where they

1132
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,560
did not

1133
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,520
meet the requirements to

1134
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,880
solve the problem or i address the

1135
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,200
problem of rcm

1136
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,079
and then we put together a solution uh

1137
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,480
you know suggested solutions for the

1138
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,760
different

1139
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,520
use cases and finally we are now in the

1140
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,880
process of liaising the completed paper

1141
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,119
out to other standards

1142
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,640
bodies

1143
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,359
so just a quick uh timeline of the the

1144
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,520
work group we started it

1145
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,599
just over a year ago

1146
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,960
we initially identified the

1147
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,079
use cases we're going to look at

1148
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,560
at that time we did liaise those over to

1149
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,359
the group as you've heard that

1150
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,000
it has been shared with this group

1151
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,319
then we moved into the next part of

1152
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,720
discovering and analyzing the different

1153
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,520
solutions that we had identified how

1154
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,280
they could be applied to the different

1155
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,000
use cases to address the rcm

1156
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,400
and just uh

1157
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
less than a couple weeks ago we

1158
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,880
finalized that paper and at the

1159
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,560
beginning of this month we started the

1160
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,119
process of liaising the paper over to

1161
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,319
this group so they can make use of it as

1162
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,200
as a reference

1163
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,119
so

1164
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,560
within the paper there was many findings

1165
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,800
that we have and we have wrapped those

1166
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,520
up

1167
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,440
which includes

1168
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,599
the need of identifying the device or

1169
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,520
the user and identifying that up to the

1170
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,480
higher layers earlier you heard i think

1171
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,359
it was bob or

1172
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,119
the individual talking about the

1173
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,640
unmanned uh aircraft how that you know

1174
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,200
that's a prime example of where the mac

1175
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,520
address or some sort of identification

1176
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,319
needs to move to upper level functions

1177
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,520
and there is cases where we don't need

1178
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,640
to just identify the device but link

1179
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,520
that device to a particular user and how

1180
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,680
that is done

1181
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,119
we did identify that it was paramount

1182
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,839
that the device and the user maintain

1183
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,640
its privacy that it cannot be or should

1184
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,000
not be

1185
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,040
able to be sniffed or tracked

1186
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,280
so that the user can can traverse across

1187
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,359
different venues or

1188
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,079
you know move around without the the

1189
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,520
indication of being being tracked or

1190
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,240
just you know identifying where they're

1191
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,480
making use of different data

1192
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,280
so

1193
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,839
we did a we did look at it that over

1194
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,599
years as we know

1195
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,480
the mac address has been used by

1196
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,119
different functions different networks

1197
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,160
different individuals for many different

1198
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,599
aspects and while the mac address was

1199
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,240
not set up to for this use it was a easy

1200
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,040
indicator to identify a device for

1201
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,319
different

1202
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,440
functions such as access control

1203
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,560
being able to troubleshoot and also even

1204
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,640
within law enforcement

1205
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,640
that the

1206
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,160
you know this is something that is

1207
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,240
needed that we need to be able to at

1208
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,480
least identify the device

1209
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,040
somehow or other in order to maintain

1210
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,280
these functionalities

1211
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,200
we in looking at the different

1212
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:08,079
technologies that are out there

1213
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:08,839
we

1214
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,240
also um looked at how they attempt to

1215
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,599
identify the device either directly or

1216
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,480
through the user uh to identify the

1217
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,599
device

1218
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,440
and that

1219
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,720
um

1220
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,440
you know this is this is how we can do

1221
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,760
it how we could take these solutions and

1222
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,880
apply them to the various use cases

1223
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,000
so as as we were looking at this and

1224
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,480
talking to different vendors we found

1225
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,119
out that in the majority of cases the

1226
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,160
current rcm implementation

1227
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,280
is

1228
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,240
a standard or session based

1229
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,119
or a time base that they will maintain

1230
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,079
that same mac address but once a session

1231
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,000
is as ended and that ssid or network has

1232
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,800
been forgotten it comes back generally

1233
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,240
with a new ssi or a new mac address

1234
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,400
however there is some

1235
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,800
applications where even during the

1236
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,240
session and if the network has not been

1237
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,200
forgotten over a period of time the mac

1238
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,040
address is reset and this impacts

1239
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,839
like i said the the earlier conditions

1240
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,040
such as troubleshooting

1241
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,559
access control one prime example is you

1242
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,559
know you visit a hotel you go through a

1243
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,440
captive portal you go out for

1244
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,240
several hours or a day and you come back

1245
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,079
now you have to go through that process

1246
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,640
again because your your mac address has

1247
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,520
changed so it becomes a very repetitive

1248
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,440
reduces the user experience

1249
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,520
based on that

1250
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,480
as we you know as indicated above

1251
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,520
privacy is paramount so

1252
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,839
with the rcm

1253
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,440
it does ensure address privacy or device

1254
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,480
privacy and it helps prevent tracking as

1255
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,920
well as

1256
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,280
snooping or

1257
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,119
interfering or

1258
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,240
putting out a rogue device that

1259
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,520
could mirror

1260
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,880
a actual device that is connecting

1261
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,480
so in

1262
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,720
in this while we're looking at the

1263
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,280
different solutions one thing we found

1264
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,040
that was very key is there is no one set

1265
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,760
solution that solves it all it's it's

1266
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,000
not a single solution

1267
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,240
to blanket all use cases

1268
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,760
but that a

1269
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,599
set of

1270
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,800
solutions could be used to cover most of

1271
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,000
the the use cases however

1272
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,040
that some of these solutions actually

1273
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,520
will conflict with the with each other

1274
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,559
so they can't be used in harmony and

1275
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,599
this this wraps up

1276
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,559
all the basic findings that we found the

1277
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,880
these findings are listed out in the

1278
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,240
white paper as i mentioned earlier

1279
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,680
we the wba is in the process of

1280
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,040
completing the liaison to make the paper

1281
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,240
available to the

1282
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,000
to this group

1283
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,559
there is plans that this paper to be

1284
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,559
published

1285
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,599
publicly but that is probably about

1286
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,599
three months out

1287
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,040
so with that

1288
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,880
uh and closing

1289
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,240
is there any questions

1290
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,520
thank you very much luther um i put

1291
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,480
myself in the queue first of all uh we

1292
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,119
very much appreciate the report from wba

1293
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,960
i think it's extremely useful and

1294
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,480
relevant

1295
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,640
and i just want to clarify as you

1296
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,480
mentioned that

1297
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,280
we

1298
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,440
we very much like the the fact that you

1299
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,280
are communicating with us

1300
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,240
this uh white paper the information is

1301
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,720
very useful and relevant and we we are

1302
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,040
as you know we are just clearing out

1303
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,599
the way to make sure that it's uh

1304
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,520
shared properly

1305
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,480
but with that in mind i think that this

1306
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,480
paper is

1307
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,599
is a

1308
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,319
extremely relevant and useful reference

1309
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,400
for for our use cases

1310
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,680
so

1311
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,559
for

1312
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,520
of course not only manage networks uh we

1313
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,359
are going to look at all type of

1314
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,559
networks

1315
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,520
but uh we have to make sure that uh

1316
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,040
all the use cases that you mentioned are

1317
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,440
covered perhaps there are some that fall

1318
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,520
outside your scope and that would be

1319
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,839
fine but for the ones that do fall in

1320
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,119
your scope

1321
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,839
we don't want to reinvent the wheel so

1322
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:42,800
having

1323
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,680
access to this white paper so that it

1324
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,800
can be

1325
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,640
either referenced or uh

1326
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,920
i don't know if

1327
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,400
the information can be just referenced

1328
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,119
and copied or or simply it will depend

1329
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,880
on whether the document is public or not

1330
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,079
i guess

1331
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,800
but once we have that that

1332
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,119
information we can revisit

1333
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,640
i guess the the jerome's draft on the

1334
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,000
use cases

1335
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,559
and uh go back to the

1336
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,319
to the drawing board and see if these

1337
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,640
solutions that you mentioned

1338
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,079
map to the ones that we are identifying

1339
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,240
and uh move forward

1340
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,720
as as you know the the purpose of this

1341
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,520
group is to find the the gaps

1342
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,079
uh and then ideally point to solutions

1343
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,920
if you are already doing that and you

1344
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,079
found some issues that's that's perfect

1345
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,000
if those issues fall in the scope of

1346
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,280
ietf

1347
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,960
then it will be

1348
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,440
the next the next topic for for martinez

1349
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,680
to see how we can do that if we have to

1350
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,400
talk to the relevant working group or if

1351
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,640
we have to do something some new work

1352
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,200
etc

1353
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,880
yeah it was

1354
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,680
it was interesting looking at where the

1355
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,599
gaps were

1356
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,000
based on on solutions that were

1357
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,400
currently out there and how they apply

1358
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,800
to the use cases

1359
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
thank you very much

1360
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,720
okay

1361
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,110
excellent thank you so

1362
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,960
[Music]

1363
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,200
now we are moving to

1364
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,759
jerome

1365
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,680
in

1366
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,240
sorry jerome you'll have to give a

1367
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,319
quick update of the latest and greatest

1368
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,079
from ieee

1369
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,839
because we're running a little late

1370
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,880
yep no worries at all

1371
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,440
anyway it's it's going to be a recap of

1372
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,760
what we've heard before uh you know that

1373
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,599
the i at the ihp there are multiple

1374
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,359
groups the one i'm going to focus on is

1375
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,599
the 802 group you know the networking

1376
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:44,400
group

1377
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,160
um and you know we mentioned before

1378
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,400
there was a group called 802e which

1379
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,880
brings recommendations for privacy

1380
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,520
um uh in consideration in the

1381
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,839
development of

1382
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,839
standards um so i want to mention this

1383
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,599
one because maybe we this is one of

1384
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,280
those where we will want to to have a

1385
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,839
look to but the main two i would like to

1386
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,880
focus on are the 8.11bh

1387
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,119
and bi where uh many of you have heard

1388
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,359
of um so they were formed at the end of

1389
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,520
of a group of study of privacy and the

1390
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,640
effect of rcm in 802.11

1391
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,400
standards and they have two different

1392
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,680
objectives that i will give you and

1393
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,119
update what they are bh is a short term

1394
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,280
you know at the scale of the ieee group

1395
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,240
um its goal is to say uh vendors like

1396
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,480
apple as some i mentioned that but some

1397
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,319
others as well are randomizing mac

1398
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,599
addresses what is the effect on 802.11

1399
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,119
services

1400
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,720
uh so sorry i mentioned for you to

1401
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,880
mention that rcm is randomized and

1402
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,960
changing mac address so rcm randomized

1403
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,559
and changing mac address

1404
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,359
so um given that devices randomize and

1405
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:50,720
change the mac address what is the

1406
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,960
effect on 8.11 service and is there

1407
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,280
something that needs to be done um in

1408
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,319
the ieee a total 11 group to address

1409
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,839
though the effect of those mac address

1410
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,160
changes um the idea in this group is

1411
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,559
that the a total 11 standard does not

1412
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,480
allow a station to change its mac

1413
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,040
address while in session so you can

1414
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,400
change your mac address between

1415
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,480
connections but not within a connection

1416
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,920
as of today

1417
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,520
but you know changing between sessions

1418
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,799
can have some effects like you know

1419
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,480
troubleshooting you know you have a

1420
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,040
problem with your um phone connected to

1421
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,040
wi-fi in the enterprise today you can

1422
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,400
support tomorrow morning and they don't

1423
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,760
know who you are because the mac address

1424
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,079
has changed um so that's the kind of

1425
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,680
thing they are

1426
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,480
looking into in the uh current status of

1427
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,960
the group they identified of course that

1428
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,520
you know multiple things may be broken

1429
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,040
by rcm

1430
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,359
and they have identified nine uh

1431
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,599
solutions which essentially are about

1432
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,240
trying to pass an identifier between the

1433
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,480
station and the access point

1434
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,400
so that if the station changes its mac

1435
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,160
address from one day to the other from

1436
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,880
one session to the other etc um it can

1437
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,960
come back and re-express an identifier

1438
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,440
back to the ap and essentially in these

1439
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,520
nine proposals you know some suggest

1440
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,000
that the ap gives an identifier then the

1441
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,760
station comes back and decides to

1442
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,440
re-express that identifier if it wants

1443
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,319
to be

1444
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,960
still identified or doesn't do it if it

1445
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,040
doesn't want to be identified next time

1446
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,799
some others say well no it's the station

1447
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,960
that's going to express an identifier

1448
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,720
and if it wants to be identified again

1449
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,720
the next time then within the secure

1450
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,000
connection to the access point it's

1451
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,400
going to re-express the same identifier

1452
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,240
and some others say well no it has to be

1453
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,400
a sort of combined agreement between the

1454
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,000
two where they express a sort of

1455
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,079
algorithm for example which means that

1456
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,960
as the station changes its mac address

1457
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,960
the ap can process a computation that

1458
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,960
recognizes that the next identifier is

1459
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,880
the same as the one before

1460
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,200
um so that is that is the status of

1461
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,680
where bh is they are a little bit late

1462
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,280
uh they were starting to um they were

1463
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,760
planning to have a text uh by this uh

1464
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,599
march they don't have it yet and they're

1465
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,880
still discussing which of these

1466
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,520
solutions should be adopted and how etc

1467
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,119
um but their target is short they

1468
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,359
express the intent to be finished by the

1469
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,040
end of the next year

1470
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,960
and there's another group which is

1471
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,359
longer term which is bi

1472
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,280
and what these people do is that they

1473
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,400
look at 80.11 and try to identify if

1474
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,559
there is a way to augment the privacy of

1475
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,280
devices within 80.11 it's obvious that

1476
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,760
anybody can sniff the network um so they

1477
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,440
want to see there are some identifiers

1478
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,119
sent in 8 11 frames um that could expose

1479
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,680
you know the um uniquely uh

1480
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,280
the identity of a device you know beyond

1481
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,119
the mac address mac address being just

1482
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,559
one of them and of course they

1483
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:33,520
identified tons of them um so for now

1484
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,520
they are going through combing the

1485
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,599
standards and they have try to make

1486
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,920
requirements on what exactly should be

1487
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,160
protected and against what um so that's

1488
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,400
an interesting work for us to look at um

1489
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,760
and of course you know their approach is

1490
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,680
very much focused on these first two

1491
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,359
layers you know the thigh and the back

1492
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,559
layer um so the uh and that's what we

1493
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:53,920
most of us know right that there are

1494
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,079
some keys that you exchange for which

1495
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:56,960
you

1496
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,119
um make an identification by saying i'm

1497
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,280
reusing key number 55 when you rejoin

1498
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,839
well if we identify the key then we may

1499
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,760
identify the station because

1500
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,760
that's the the station that was using

1501
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,599
keep 55 before

1502
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,359
there is mac address exposure you know

1503
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,799
you have a header which has a lot of

1504
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,280
options um many of which allow to

1505
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,680
uniquely identify a flow or the station

1506
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,480
so they are listing all these exposures

1507
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,839
that they call requirements you know

1508
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,000
that the thing should be obfuscated at

1509
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,880
this stage they should finish by this

1510
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,960
summer ish once they have that they'll

1511
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,280
start looking into 80.11 and start

1512
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,359
looking into what they should do what

1513
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,480
tech should be

1514
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,880
brought into the standard to alleviate

1515
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,599
those exposure so those two you know for

1516
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,520
us are probably interesting to look into

1517
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,160
bh not so much because i think we will

1518
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,200
find items for us to refer to because

1519
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,880
they are looking at short fixes on the

1520
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,960
ids to pass an identifier but it's

1521
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,839
interesting for us to realize where this

1522
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,319
identifier is scoped to be limited to

1523
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,760
and it's really between the station and

1524
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,599
the access point so as we progress in

1525
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:00,960
our work it will be interesting to see

1526
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,920
if we can use that identifier or not a

1527
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,640
bi is is also interesting but another

1528
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,319
level uh to look at what kind of

1529
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,400
exposure we have beyond the mac address

1530
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,480
um which you know can be used maybe for

1531
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,599
us to

1532
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,520
as an inspiration or example to look

1533
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,359
into what kind of exposure we may have

1534
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,839
beyond the mac address um when we talk

1535
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,760
between uh station and services in this

1536
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,079
group if we decide to go there

1537
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:25,680
so you'll find here um you know these

1538
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,000
documents the 8011 is very open so if

1539
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
you go to the second link you can access

1540
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,240
pretty much any public document

1541
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,599
in the working representations

1542
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,680
contributions etc the only thing you

1543
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,319
cannot access is the draft really of the

1544
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:39,680
next standard but you know you don't

1545
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,440
need that we don't have any at that

1546
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,119
stage yet

1547
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,720
let me end there so that i don't take

1548
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,799
too much of my time and check if there

1549
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:47,839
are

1550
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,960
short questions before we move on

1551
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,559
okay

1552
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,440
thank you very much jerome

1553
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,440
are there any questions before moving to

1554
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,680
the next steps we are

1555
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,680
at the top of the hour a minute

1556
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,480
if there are no questions i would first

1557
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,079
thank you for the updates and the

1558
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,799
presentations uh thank you very much

1559
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,599
and i think this is this is great to see

1560
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,359
that

1561
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,880
at least to me it looks like we have all

1562
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,559
the pieces of the puzzle

1563
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,799
we have the inputs from wba we know

1564
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:23,280
what's happening in ieee

1565
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,599
we are starting to identify the relevant

1566
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,920
use cases in and it's just a matter of

1567
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,240
putting all the pieces together now

1568
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,720
uh so that we have the the full picture

1569
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,040
of of what are the needs what are the

1570
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,640
solutions and

1571
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,480
move on to identify the the actual gaps

1572
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,079
uh for the uh whatever use case or user

1573
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,079
if there are any

1574
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:46,960
so

1575
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,599
it seems like we have an interesting uh

1576
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:50,480
and

1577
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,040
uh limited work to do which is also in

1578
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,720
line with the short lived uh

1579
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,400
task groups that you mentioned and and

1580
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,880
this one it himself

1581
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,920
so

1582
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,920
perfect seems to me that we have some

1583
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,960
some interesting homework to do from uh

1584
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,839
now till the summer at

1585
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,280
least and

1586
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,720
well we are at the top of the hour one

1587
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,480
minute over in fact

1588
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,240
