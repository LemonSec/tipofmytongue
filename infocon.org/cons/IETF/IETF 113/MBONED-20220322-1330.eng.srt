1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,440
um i think

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,880
the

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,160
there's a bigger picture than what i

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,720
worked on i did some uh some interop

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,840
with the amd um which i can go over uh

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,800

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,760
uh people did some beer work as well if

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,679

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,640
gotcha

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,040
unfortunate

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
uh we did

177
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,039
last time we updated this

178
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,880
added a couple other authors and they

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,120
made some good contributions

180
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,720
and the once the other drafts do

181
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,160
progress in ipp ippm

182
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,240
we probably will pretty quickly after

183
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,479
this one to be reviewed and progressed

184
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,360
because

185
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,039
when we submitted this draft it was

186
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,120
actually it's one of those rare drafts

187
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
that when we submitted it

188
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,160
it's almost

189
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,520
ready to go kind of a thing um

190
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
so anyway yeah

191
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,560
we'll we keep it alive and we give minor

192
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,879
updates to it and we will present it as

193
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,479
you mentioned at the next idea

194
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,720
jake

195
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,599
you have something to add

196
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,680
there's implementations

197
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,520
say that one more time

198
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
uh when you said that's ready to go do

199
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,160
you mean that that there's

200
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,919
implementations or

201
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,520
no that it's complete as far as the

202
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,479
work in the draft is concerned i don't

203
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,160
think this working group has a

204
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,680
requirement for implementations but i

205
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,159
could be wrong

206
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
great thanks

207
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,440
um then there are of course the

208
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,159
multicast to the browser drafts

209
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,519
the four

210
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,279
and jake's going to provide updates on

211
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,120
this later in the agenda or later

212
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
he's next up

213
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,680
the ingress redundant ingress failover

214
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,080
this is a document that is

215
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,279
currently

216
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,800
has an adoption call underway

217
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,080
and actually

218
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
and i'm

219
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
uh working group adoption call goes

220
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,920
through this friday um so so far we've

221
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,120
had uh

222
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,880
a number i haven't counted but there has

223
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,320
been some responses but we'd love to

224
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,040
have more um please it's a short draft

225
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,880
please do take a look and

226
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
respond whether you would or would not

227
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,839
like to

228
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,880
adopt

229
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
uh and any substantive comments as well

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
um and actually i believe sandy is going

231
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,640
to talk about this next

232
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,320
so

233
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
um let's see what else what's up on the

234
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
agenda

235
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
okay next up on the agenda is a

236
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
hackathon update um so frederick i

237
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
believe you said the component of the

238
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,240
hackathon that you were involved in was

239
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,880
not multicast related um so if that's

240
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,600
the case maybe jake if you want to

241
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,760
if you want to speak up about

242
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,240
what you're aware of

243
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
sure um

244
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,160
so i spent the hackathon weekend uh

245
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,440
getting ipv6 to work with the um

246
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,160
with the amtg amt gateway docker

247
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,320
container

248
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,560
and

249
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,279
running that against

250
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,040
against my own relays

251
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,079
um

252
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,440
so i got i did uh successfully

253
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,320
stream and listen to music over uh

254
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,959
v4 in v4 tunnel v6 and v4 tunnel the

255
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,480
six in v6 tunnel and v6 in

256
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,440
a v4 in v6 tunnel so all the

257
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,800
combinations

258
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,680
um

259
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,440
in addition earlier today um

260
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,760
saba pinged me on the

261
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,600
free router chat and we did a bit of

262
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
interop uh with their implementation as

263
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,200
well

264
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,519
the free router amt gateway was able to

265
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,920
connect to my relays and success also

266
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,839
successfully listed music over all four

267
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,120
of those

268
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,399
uh

269
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,040
combinations and then um

270
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
so far

271
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,880
this was only a half an hour ago um but

272
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
so far i've got uh

273
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,560
i've tried um

274
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,480
v4 over v4 and v6 over v4

275
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,399
against uh their stream and their um

276
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,839
and their relay

277
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,880
uh and i i have yet to try the uh the

278
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,680
two over the v6 relays yet

279
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
but that's anticipated there was like

280
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,839
there were like a couple of bugs um so

281
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,200
if you have

282
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,640
both online

283
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,200
and on um

284
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,959
on theirs i think that that there was an

285
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,120
update from saba i don't know like what

286
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,000
their

287
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,200
kind of

288
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,600
um commit processes like but i think i

289
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,240
think the one he's running now is uh

290
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,560
has a quick patch in it um and maybe

291
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,959
that'll be upstreamed appropriately

292
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,839
uh anyway the um

293
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,120
yeah so the the um the amt gateway

294
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,880
docker container and the mt relay d

295
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,399
now are both confirmed with uh with them

296
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,200
you know

297
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,680
each of those talking to themselves and

298
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,440
uh and to the free router implementation

299
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,839
for v6 and v4 i think

300
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,760
uh with with one

301
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,720
uh

302
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,920
set of tests still pending

303
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,880
so

304
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,040
and that's that's really all uh all i

305
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,439
know about

306
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,160
cool um so jake

307
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
uh first

308
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,800
i meant to start sending here um

309
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
so jake

310
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,440
uh

311
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,040
the

312
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,360
essentially what what was added and

313
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,360
what's new and what's unique is the

314
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,160
amt relay and v6 enabled relay and

315
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,480
gateway

316
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,760
you didn't make any changes to ff

317
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
mpeg or

318
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,800
vlc those just worked

319
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,680
uh yeah that's that's correct those

320
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,160
those just worked um so this is of

321
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,839
course with an external gateway not the

322
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
embedded uh

323
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,440
gateway inside vlc but um

324
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,279
with the external relay then those those

325
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,120
just work for uh

326
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,639
for both v4 and v6 ssm i did not try asm

327
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,720
but i don't care so gotcha i i will try

328
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
if somebody else wants to but i haven't

329
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,959
tried it yet i think it'll be fine

330
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,800
because for the for the client side it's

331
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,399
going to be very

332
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,240
identical

333
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,279
great

334
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
anybody else involved in the hackathon

335
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,639
have anything to add

336
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,920
any other background or commentary

337
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,360
that is related to multicast

338
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,199
okay

339
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,430
uh in that case let's move on to sandy

340
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,839
[Music]

341
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,279
and i will

342
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,839
bring up those slides

343
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,000
okay

344
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,880
sandy can you see the slide and

345
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,399
you are ready to go and uh i believe you

346
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,120
should have control over the slide

347
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,399
i think

348
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,680
can you

349
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,320
i can't if i can kind of choose those

350
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,480
slides

351
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,519
this is sure your

352
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,560
your is sharing your screen and then i

353
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,399
can do the control work

354
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,279
i'm not very sure how can i do it are

355
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,760
you able to

356
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,120
um i think i can't

357
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,480
no no

358
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,279
okay how about now

359
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,160
let me try

360
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,800
it seems comfortable with

361
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,839
i can't put you down

362
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,920
no luck this doesn't work now

363
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,199
no walk

364
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,360
okay all right you just tell me and i'll

365
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,680
i'll uh

366
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,439
i'll take

367
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,639
uh okay let me redo this again

368
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
okay thank you

369
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,360
okay

370
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,320
hello everyone and i'm samidhan from zt

371
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,720
this presentation is for the update of

372
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,759
multicast redundant english router fair

373
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,040
overdraft

374
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,920
we have co-author greg isong from china

375
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,279
mobile and the intern from china unicom

376
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,000
next please

377
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,240
hold on a second here

378
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,720
doesn't seem to want to let me move this

379
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,959
thing

380
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:02,959
so

381
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,920
this is the brief introduction of this

382
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,040
dropped

383
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,440
usually two increased routers are

384
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,399
deployed for avoiding a single node

385
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,360
failure

386
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,000
and the two ingress router can forward a

387
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,120
same multicast flow for the egress

388
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,399
routers which connect the receivers they

389
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,360
can select the um edge for

390
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,920
multicultural flow forwarding

391
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,560
their three modes can be used for

392
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,639
linguist routers

393
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,639
protection for or faster switch over

394
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,880
there are cool standby

395
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,360
modes and the warm standard mode and the

396
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,279
whole standby mode

397
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,560
the three

398
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,440
standby modes can be used with

399
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,720
all the existing multicast technologies

400
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,399
such as pim

401
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,560
beer p2mpt tunnel or mrdp

402
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,440
the cost and the influence of the three

403
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,040
modes are different

404
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,920
the network administrator should select

405
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,319
the appropriate mode according to the

406
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,520
service requirements

407
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,640
hey seems i can page down the slides

408
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,400
okay okay i can do the control

409
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
it work now

410
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
so this is the update of

411
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,839
version there are two

412
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,720
we added a section for failure detection

413
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,559
according to jake's comments uh

414
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,240
thanksgix

415
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,039
and

416
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,600
in order to achieve the successful

417
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,039
ir switch over vfd or ping methods can

418
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,320
be used for monitor the ir node fader or

419
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,080
path fader between ir and the ers

420
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,039
for vft methods vfd

421
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,640
fc5880 can be used in all the

422
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,240
deployments

423
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,799
uh multipoint bfd

424
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,080
fc8562 can be used

425
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
can also be used for the failure

426
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,200
detection between ir and the ers

427
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,919
vfd for ampere's lcps

428
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,200
that is fc584

429
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,360
can be used in p2mpt

430
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,840
or mrdp

431
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,919
deployments vrbfd can be used in via

432
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,679
deployment

433
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,360
for ping methods

434
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,880
fpv4pin

435
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,360
fc07

436
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,000
li2 and the ipv6 ping fc triple fours

437
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,080
three can also be used in all the

438
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
deployments

439
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,480
usb ping

440
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,320
fc8029 can be used for p2 and pt

441
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,320
internal or mrdp deployments uh buildpin

442
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,919
can also be used in real deployment

443
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,200
so backup ir and er can detect the

444
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,080
selected ir node and the path failure

445
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,640
easily by these methods

446
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,520
when er detects the fader of

447
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,720
sir

448
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,840
er master signal to bir as soon as

449
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,880
possible

450
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,320
or er can get the flow from bir in

451
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,080
advance

452
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,440
when bir detects the fader of

453
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,960
sir vrr takes over the sirs

454
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
responsibility and forwards flow two

455
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,400
years

456
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,280
but the mistakens which over may occur

457
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,240
because

458
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,440
in case

459
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,880
only one only the path between bir and

460
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
the s i are fierce

461
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,840
and in this situation yeah i may receive

462
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,080
duplicate flow

463
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,940
so

464
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,109
[Music]

465
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,799
so this is the uh during the adoption

466
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,080
call uh we receive many useful comments

467
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,320
uh thanks jk and again

468
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
we plan to add more information and

469
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,679
details in future version uh we will add

470
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,400
the signaling procedure for of the three

471
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,280
modes between ir and er to make it more

472
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,720
clearly

473
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,679
details will be added for the existing

474
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,720
optimization method used in failure

475
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,080
detection for example for example fc9026

476
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,799
and some clarification for an vpn and

477
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,520
now and represent deployment will be

478
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,039
added

479
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,280
and some language improvement will be

480
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
done

481
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,440
so

482
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,799
also

483
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,360
thanks all the support and

484
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,559
we welcome more comments for it

485
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,840
that's all thank you

486
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,480
for sandy

487
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,440
hey yes

488
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,280
okay uh thank you for sharing um and

489
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
just a reminder

490
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,440
again this is still uh in the adoption

491
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,679
call um until friday so uh please

492
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,760
love folks to review

493
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,679
and um

494
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,640
and

495
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,080
at least

496
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,919
mention whether you support

497
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,960
or do not support adoption

498
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,760
of this document by the working group

499
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,000
jake uh are you ready to talk for your

500
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,880
next

501
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
or you do you have a question about this

502
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,600
draft i did actually have a question

503
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,679
about this draft uh same question

504
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,559
actually um is there an implementation

505
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,480
along these lines

506
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,240
open daylight or

507
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,559
any production environments that

508
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,080
that you're basing this on or is this

509
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,360
more theoretical at this point

510
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,280
in fact there's many uh yes because

511
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,679
there's many technologies included in

512
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,360
this structure and we have deployed some

513
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,159
technologies such as ping

514
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,919
and the beer has not been used widely so

515
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,039
there is no beer deployment for it but

516
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,880
there's many pink

517
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,480
deployments for it

518
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,640
so we usually use the

519
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
worm standby also the hot standby mode

520
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,880
for deployment so

521
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,159
for

522
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,720
hot standby mode there is duplicate

523
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,159
flowing the

524
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,679
network so

525
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,720
there is

526
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,520
there are it can only be used in very

527
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,440
large broadband

528
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,200
network so

529
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,559
and if there is some network that is has

530
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,159
no very

531
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,360
large

532
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,280
band where

533
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,320
when this in the household the um maybe

534
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,080
the just

535
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
warm standby or code standard mode can

536
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,120
be used for it

537
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,799
and generally

538
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,080
the pim is used more than other

539
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
technologies yeah

540
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,280
okay great thank you

541
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,840

548
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,200
i can share some pre-loaded slides does

549
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,320
that work

550
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,760
actually you do have the power to do

551
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
that but um

552
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,000

555
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,200
now are you able to control

556
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,919
let's see i thought

557
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,600

562
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,279
um

563
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,320
hi everyone thanks um

564
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,240
yeah i'll be talking about the four

565
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,320
active drafts and

566
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,200
basically where things stand in terms of

567
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,679
this this project

568
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,320
for what we're doing

569
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,039
um what i'll be going over is uh kind of

570
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,520
progress reports uh i had a few things i

571
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,000
talked about um

572
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,360
that i was waiting to see how they

573
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,279
panned out uh that i mentioned in the

574
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,000
ietf update um so i'll be giving the

575
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,360
follow-ups on those

576
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,120
i'll be going over the overall project

577
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,000
status and uh giving a

578
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,679
brief overview of the

579
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,159
things that are

580
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,000
sort of actively in progress right now

581
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,520
i would say there's a number of things

582
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,919
kind of in the background that i

583
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,480
won't really be touching on but um

584
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,640
the the sort of major standards-based

585
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,960
pieces of it that are

586
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,640
that i know of that are making some

587
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,080
progress

588
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,080
uh and then i'll conclude with uh my

589
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,120
uh requests for action so i'd like to

590
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,159
people to consider and uh and hopefully

591
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,000
take uh

592
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,559
going forward for for what's

593
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,279
like

594
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,360
kind of going on now

595
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,480
or imminently um

596
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,360
so the the follow-ups from iatf 112 were

597
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,880
kind of negative

598
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,120
uh i um

599
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,520
you know the outcome of the dispatch

600
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,720
discussion

601
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,840
was that the uh discussion on on the

602
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,919
multicast security document was uh

603
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,559
dispatched to the msec list

604
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,400
i sent out invites but uh nobody

605
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,480
responded to anything yet um so uh that

606
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,720
was a bit disappointing i think it

607
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
indicates there's no way i'm asking for

608
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,400
a buff at present

609
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,880
um however this uh

610
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,960
the sort of

611
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,120
direction we outlined here

612
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,799
i think we did get

613
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,039
a little bit of useful feedback from uh

614
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,679
raising it there and that

615
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,640
that feedback and the

616
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,600
sort of

617
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,520
our thinking that went into this draft

618
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,360
is is still guiding what we intend to do

619
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,159
in the in the near term towards uh still

620
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,840
getting still reaching the browser use

621
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,480
case uh eventually

622
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,360
um

623
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,480
but i think i do consider this a

624
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,159
mild setback for the moment um

625
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,679
likewise the

626
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,159
w3c web transport

627
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,559
uh working group was

628
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,960
i had an issue open with them uh

629
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,880
requesting um

630
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,880
requesting that they would add multicast

631
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,240
as a use case

632
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,840
from the w3c side they rejected it

633
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,640
on

634
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,200
two points one is that

635
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,520
they are uninterested unless there's

636
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,679
browsers expressing an interest

637
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,720
and

638
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,200
that it's also premature

639
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,720
at least that was in the minutes that

640
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,919
their meeting

641
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,159
the comments indicated that

642
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,799
this really needs ietf work before w3c

643
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,360
can consider taking it on

644
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,000
so that that is driving part of the work

645
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,919
that we're uh that we're moving forward

646
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,000
with now as well

647
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,919
uh lenny i see you in the queue

648
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,840
yeah so maybe this is a question for for

649
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,200
uh um

650
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,080
warren as well uh advice here

651
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,440
it seems like we have a lot of circular

652
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,799
dependencies here uh

653
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,360
we're trying to bring add this to the

654
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,039
browser the browser people are saying

655
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,640
there's not enough

656
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,559
people are asking for this there's not

657
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,559
enough demand there's not enough ietf

658
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,960
activity on this uh

659
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,840
and

660
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,200
and yet

661
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,840
we seem to be generating atf activity

662
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,960
and interest um so how do we kind of

663
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,520
break through this log jam and

664
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,200
is there something we as a working uh

665
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
and so maybe a question to warren as

666
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,720
well is there something we as a working

667
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,279
group can be providing as feedback to

668
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,440
say hey this would be valuable um

669
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
there's there's we've got operators have

670
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,360
spoken up um and uh several other folks

671
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,520
have spoken up that this is interesting

672
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,200
and yet um

673
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
you know there seems to be a little bit

674
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,440
less uh

675
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,960
uh agreement um from others on that so

676
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,399
what do you what do you suggest both

677
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,600
jake and and um

678
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,039
uh so for

679
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,919
the first thing let me suggest that we

680
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,399
uh that we table that till the end of

681
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,559
the uh to the last slide where i'm

682
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,159
asking for actions

683
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,559
um and uh and

684
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,799
because i do have one related thing that

685
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,960
i'll uh that i'd like to

686
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,399
discuss and we can discuss whether

687
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,120
there's a better thing to do or what the

688
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,039
kind of ideas

689
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,880
are in this space

690
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,480
but

691
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,840
let me first just kind of paint the

692
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,080
whole picture overall and tell you where

693
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,440
i'm headed

694
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
and what i think is the right kind of

695
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
response to this but i am happy to take

696
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,200
suggestions and feedback

697
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
uh warrant anything you want to throw on

698
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,679
top of that

699
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,240
no hopefully you've got a good idea for

700
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,279
the suggested actions because i don't

701
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,919
all right uh great then um

702
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,159
uh and i

703
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,840
i do want to say it's

704
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,880
this

705
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,360
criticism that it requires ietf work

706
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,480
first

707
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,880
is not necessarily saying that

708
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,600
as i understand it is not necessarily

709
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,679
saying that there's no ietf interest

710
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,960
it's rather saying that the work to make

711
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,799
this viable for web transport has not

712
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,600
yet occurred in the ietf and so the w3c

713
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,200
web transport cannot

714
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,520
reasonably consider it so that that was

715
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,760
my take on it um

716
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,440
now whether that will go forward or

717
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,200
whether we'll hit a similar wall when i

718
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,880
try to take this to quick

719
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,640
that is that is to be determined and

720
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,240
that's where i was going to

721
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
to go with that question which we'll

722
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,039
talk about a little bit more later

723
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,720
uh anyway so

724
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,440
in light of these kind of setbacks our

725
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,320
current strategy is to begin some

726
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,000
uh we're aiming to do some production

727
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,240
deployment that's going to be

728
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,200
the deployment of uh

729
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,720
so i i don't know if it'll be inner

730
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,679
domain in the very first run but we are

731
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,080
aiming to do some inner domain multicast

732
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,600
production deployment

733
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,880
uh

734
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,159
without browser support

735
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
under the understanding that in the long

736
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
term we still are going to need to get

737
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,520
to the browser

738
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
but we think that you know in the in the

739
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,799
beginning i was kind of thinking in

740
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,919
terms of

741
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,000
um if we can get some browser support

742
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,480
that's that's there on the way then this

743
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,640
will make it more attractive to isps

744
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,320
which i think is true

745
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,640
however i think the other way also goes

746
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,399
the other way around also applies if we

747
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,679
can make this

748
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,240
uh if we can get some traffic running uh

749
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,919
in some real isps then it will make it

750
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,919
more attractive to browsers

751
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,600
um so

752
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,760
you know as always with multicast we

753
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,039
have a chicken and egg problem and we're

754
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,559
trying to address it and we can address

755
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,240
it kind of on either side

756
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,919
um

757
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,679
but i think that they they support one

758
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,399
another right first you make a

759
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,159
thing that's not quite a lizard but also

760
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,000
isn't yet a chicken and that lays an egg

761
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,399
that has it that grows into a chicken

762
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,760
right so

763
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,080
um

764
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,240
anyway uh we are we are not abandoning

765
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,080
that effort but uh

766
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,360
i do

767
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,559
i do consider this a

768
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,440
a minor setback but i think this is not

769
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,159
unexpected when encountering security uh

770
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,320
feedback for the first time so that's

771
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
that's where that stands

772
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,320
um

773
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,600
so in terms of overall project status uh

774
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,440
and this is kind of the

775
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,320
um you know the akamai funding-ish view

776
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,559
uh we have moved this project out of r d

777
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,640
and into a product team and we're trying

778
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,840
to now

779
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,880
uh find the right set of partners uh or

780
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,279
even single partner to take this forward

781
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,120
into a production run

782
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,200
uh that we can start deploying but we

783
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,399
think we've convinced ourselves that

784
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,960
this has a real business case um

785
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,600
and that that's not uh

786
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
that's not quite the same as as me

787
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,240
engineering hacker uh saying

788
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,840
it sounds like a good idea that's more

789
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,679
like the people who tried to shoot it

790
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,440
down uh

791
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,559
because that's their job you know i

792
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,559
ended up concluding that okay this

793
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,519
probably is worth looking at in in more

794
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,600
detail and provided we can get some

795
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,640
partners

796
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,480
the intent is to go ahead with this

797
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,760
as of now so

798
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,840
we are

799
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,919
um we are in talks with a few partners

800
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,679
uh and uh

801
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,799
and

802
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,039
looking to make that work out if other

803
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,000
people think that they'd be good

804
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,200
partners for those two then we'd be

805
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,279
happy to to engage with them as well uh

806
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,000
so anybody here that wants to um that

807
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,760
wants to ping me about that please do

808
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,600
feel free and we can talk about it

809
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,720
i can get you in touch with the right

810
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,440
people um

811
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,919
so uh yeah we're aiming to get like some

812
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,000
traffic running uh

813
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,480
within the next one or two years um

814
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,519
probably we'd start that out in uh you

815
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,240
know some some limited networks um for

816
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,600
the first few runs and then uh

817
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,519
expand it out into the generalized inner

818
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,240
domain stuff at least that's the plan um

819
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,200
and we are we are still aiming to uh to

820
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,039
address both software downloads and

821
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,080
video

822
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,080
um so that is uh that is key to to

823
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,200
kind of

824
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,760
making those peak offloads be actually

825
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
addressable for for the networks and for

826
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,200
ourselves

827
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,440
um

828
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,399
so uh in terms of getting

829
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,799
to the browser ultimately which we like

830
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,240
i said do you still consider a very

831
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,679
important

832
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,760
uh thing to solve in the end um

833
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,559
i we've just started uh

834
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,919
a

835
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,760
a a draft that tries to extend quick

836
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,919
this tries to build on the quick

837
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,760
multi-path that was

838
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,279
very recently adopted in the quick

839
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,440
working group

840
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,600
and

841
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,120
it's i mean it'll be different because

842
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,320
it's going to be multicast but it

843
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,480
actually has

844
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,320
kind of a lot of overlap with

845
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,599
the the kinds of things they're

846
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,440
discovering in the quick working group

847
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,520
about

848
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,800
about multicast as they do the

849
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,440
implementation and evaluation

850
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,280
so we're hoping to leverage some of that

851
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,639
work and we're also hoping that this

852
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,839
will actually make it simpler at the

853
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,839
application layer

854
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,480
because it's going to be

855
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,560
at least mostly transparent

856
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,320
to the

857
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,359
to the

858
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,960
web applications that would be making

859
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,199
use of it so they don't they won't have

860
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,199
to do anything special except maybe like

861
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,520
enable it or disable it at the high

862
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,000
level and sort of permit the underlying

863
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,679
stack to use multicast or not use

864
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,239
multicast but that's the intent the

865
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,879
intended direction we're going uh as a

866
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,760
rough overview i i have the link to our

867
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,599
github repo where we've

868
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,599
posted a an early version of the draft

869
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,680
that doesn't have much content it's just

870
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,359
a

871
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,079
like the abstract and intro and outline

872
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,320
and a few consideration a few security

873
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,079
considerations including the link to the

874
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,359
uh

875
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,920
to the other document so none of this is

876
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,839
adopted and there are many ways this can

877
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,520
go wrong but this is our current plan

878
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,400
for how to to move this forward

879
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,520
um we'd be baking it into quick so it's

880
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,720
going to be built on a

881
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,000
on a

882
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,760
unicast connection as your sort of

883
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,880
anchor

884
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,079
that provides all the security

885
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,720
guarantees and

886
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,599
probably uh in a similar way to ambi the

887
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,480
um

888
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
you know stream of hashes

889
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,599
but that'll be um

890
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,760
you know instructing the client to you

891
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,320
know if you are uh willing and able go

892
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,000
ahead and join this multicast stream

893
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,520
you'll be receiving quick packets

894
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,960
they'll be encrypted

895
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,000
uh they'll

896
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,280
um

897
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,599
hopefully match up with our uh

898
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,400
with our security considerations

899
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,640
uh for multicast uh insights and uh

900
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,880
and then they'll be interpreted as as

901
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,119
you know just just another uh

902
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,880
unidirectional data stream on the quick

903
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,839
side so we think we can transport

904
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,200
or we think it makes really good sense

905
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,560
to transport

906
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,720
uh unidirectional web transport streams

907
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,400
from server to client

908
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,920
this way and also

909
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,320
probably h3 the the server push

910
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
uh for web objects unfortunately

911
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,240
browsers are removing the server push

912
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,839
cache um and the server push feature

913
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,160
uh from browsers right now um however uh

914
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,720
through the web transport um

915
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,160
unidirectional streams it still should

916
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,680
be possible to

917
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,160
kind of implement that yourself as

918
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,839
inside your web app

919
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,680
um so

920
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,280
you know ultimately we'll

921
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,200
hopefully have demos of this and and

922
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,599
some stuff running and a

923
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,920
coherent document to present

924
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,880
um lucas pardue has agreed to co-author

925
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,240
this he's the

926
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,880
he's the first author on the um

927
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,680
on the other multicast over quick

928
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
http draft this is a little bit

929
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,800
different because this is going to be

930
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,000
operating at the quick layer whereas

931
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,560
that one was operating at the http layer

932
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,359
um

933
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,119
and using alt service whereas this one

934
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,119
will be using quick frames there will be

935
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,359
new quick frames uh kind of loosely

936
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,599
based on the on the multipath

937
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,400
approach but

938
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,640
this this is where we're headed

939
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,599
uh

940
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,119
as a

941
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,359
very attentive target which i probably

942
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,440
shouldn't put in because this is perhaps

943
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,640
optimistic

944
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,720
um i was hoping to

945
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,880
get a prototype and initial spec

946
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,200
uh to present in july to the quick

947
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,640
working group

948
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,079
we'll see how that goes this could be

949
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,640
superseded by the by our

950
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,160
if i have to spend a lot of time on the

951
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,200
on the

952
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,119
partner deployment efforts

953
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,680
uh which actually would be even better

954
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,000
than than this in terms of uh

955
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,040
making this project a success um but i

956
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,880
do think that this is an important thing

957
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
to uh

958
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
to have on the roadmap for

959
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,720
how we get into the browser and this is

960
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,880
our current kind of plan

961
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,040
so this could slip but i am hoping to

962
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,480
have something coherent to present in

963
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,520
july

964
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,640
uh and if not then then maybe later this

965
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,240
year

966
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,079
uh

967
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,200
yeah so that's that's where the browser

968
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,839
effort stands

969
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,839
want to say thanks to max

970
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:34,880
for

971
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,079
a bunch of

972
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,760
feedback and pr's on the ambi uh draft

973
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,200
uh that is

974
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
slowly coming into shape i've been a

975
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,359
little distracted and haven't

976
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,040
haven't done a whole lot on actually

977
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,480
advancing these documents i've been

978
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,079
working more toward

979
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,040
getting

980
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,800
deployment to be viable

981
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,960
um but it is ultimately obviously going

982
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,640
to be very important to have this well

983
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,040
documented um

984
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
and i think he's uh

985
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,160
his contributions have really helped to

986
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,359
shape it up

987
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,760
uh and

988
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,800
um

989
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,520
yeah

990
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,880
it's still kind of undetermined whether

991
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,359
the quick will

992
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,680
reference this one or do

993
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,040
something a little bit different but

994
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,680
similar or what exactly but that'll be

995
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,839
kind of hammered out as as we get the

996
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:20,880
quick thing

997
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,480
further along but i was really glad to

998
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,240
see that ambi is actually progressing a

999
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,280
little bit

1000
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,440
uh which was nice

1001
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,640
um

1002
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,800
in other news the uh

1003
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,480
we have still been meeting regularly at

1004
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,640
the w3c multicast community group i

1005
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,240
encourage you all to join

1006
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,400
uh there's a

1007
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
there's a

1008
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,560
link to the w3.org community multicast

1009
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,280
uh here um and even if you're just on

1010
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,359
the mailing list um or if you take a

1011
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,240
look at the meeting minutes or

1012
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,079
recordings then you'll be getting

1013
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,760
monthly updates on this so if you're

1014
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
interested in watching then uh then keep

1015
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,040
an eye on it

1016
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,839
uh

1017
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,400
meanwhile um you know i'm

1018
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,000
getting some code contributions from

1019
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,440
some of the uh

1020
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,520
some of the multicast community group

1021
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,680
members which i'm really pleased about

1022
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,160
so thanks in particular to gavin henry

1023
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,000
uh for some of his work on live mcrx

1024
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,920
he's uh he's taking a look at adding

1025
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,760
windows support which is great

1026
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,680
but what we've already upstreamed from

1027
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,800
that was

1028
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,160
was

1029
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,359
integration

1030
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,400
the cicd pipeline integrated coverity

1031
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,760
uh scanning so it is now scanning for uh

1032
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,640
problems and and uh vulnerabilities

1033
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,560
that it can do with static analysis

1034
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,520
and uh it found several errors that we

1035
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,480
that we fixed in libmcrx so that is in

1036
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,640
better shape now than it was

1037
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,480
and rates to remain in better shape as

1038
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,720
we extend it further

1039
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,000
um

1040
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,680
that's a that's meant to be a

1041
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,560
cross-platform ssm received library

1042
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,480
and i frequently use it for for my

1043
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,599
testing

1044
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,119
um but

1045
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,640
we can go into more details about what

1046
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,319
that has i've talked about it before in

1047
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,400
the group but not recently

1048
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,230
um

1049
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,400
[Music]

1050
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,240
yeah

1051
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,960
so in conclusion the uh

1052
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,880
the things i'd like

1053
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,079
to

1054
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,800
to consider doing as a working group

1055
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,280
uh for one i'd like to go ahead and

1056
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
start the dorms last call i think i

1057
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,599
haven't had any more uh reviews

1058
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,960
um so

1059
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,319
if i'm not going to get any then i might

1060
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,160
as well go ahead

1061
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,560
uh i think it's in reasonable shape if i

1062
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
remember right um

1063
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,680
it's uh uh i i didn't actually

1064
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,119
read it all the way through last month

1065
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,960
um but uh

1066
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,240
uh

1067
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
last i looked uh i didn't have any notes

1068
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,079
left on it i think

1069
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,480
um i believe i've i've incorporated all

1070
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,960
the comments that have been made so far

1071
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,560
um

1072
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,319
second is i'd like to make dorm's

1073
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,599
ambience back into a cluster

1074
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,280
so that the

1075
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,359
they can refer to each other and get

1076
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,280
handled in a sort of

1077
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,440
clustering way for the rfc editor

1078
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,000
if anyone is able uh please do post to

1079
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,240
mseq at ietf in response to the

1080
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,720
discussion about the security

1081
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
considerations document um

1082
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,480
i think even just asking stupid

1083
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,760
questions and getting some discussion

1084
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,040
going would be

1085
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,560
a useful

1086
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,599
uh

1087
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,760
expression of interest there

1088
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,920
and uh and we might be able to learn

1089
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,240
some things and understand more about uh

1090
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,000
the right problem space especially if we

1091
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,280
can get

1092
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,520
uh any any of the existing security

1093
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,839
experts on that list to kind of engage

1094
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:40,960
as well

1095
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,960
um

1096
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,280
so for

1097
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,359
the other is that um

1098
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,880
mna i think

1099
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,640
the only feedback i've gotten so far was

1100
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,560
that it looks pretty good well thought

1101
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,760
out um

1102
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,920
you know i i looked through it and

1103
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,599
there's uh there's eight things i have

1104
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,359
marked as tbd's

1105
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,599
uh i did not actually address those but

1106
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,440
what i propose is that i should address

1107
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,920
those eight dvds and then uh and then

1108
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,160
open it up for last call or at least get

1109
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,480
some more reviews going um

1110
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,359
you know one of those uh and i i don't

1111
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,960
think it's had enough review honestly

1112
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,760
yet

1113
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,599
um although i was encouraged by the

1114
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,440
people who did respond so far so that

1115
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
was uh that was good

1116
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,599
um

1117
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,920
and then the other thing is

1118
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,040
and and maybe set a timer to reconfirm

1119
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,560
but um

1120
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,720
when they ask for conflict avoidance for

1121
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,400
the meeting scheduling let's make sure

1122
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,839
we don't collide with quick next time if

1123
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,560
we can so i can make it to both uh if

1124
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,800
that's still on the table um like i said

1125
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,560
there's a chance this will slip so if it

1126
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,119
slips then then maybe i'll want to

1127
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,880
move that request to november or

1128
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,079
something

1129
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,119
um and then but then

1130
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,599
uh and here's where we get back to the

1131
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,400
um

1132
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,000
to the original comment that we deferred

1133
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,960
till now

1134
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,599
uh lenny previously offered on the list

1135
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,440
like should we as a working group

1136
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,680
request that

1137
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,640
something security area or

1138
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,400
uh or transport area or the quick

1139
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,800
working group or whoever is the right

1140
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,319
set of people

1141
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,800
but but uh expressed to them that this

1142
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,960
is a valuable use case um from the point

1143
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
of view of the mbo d working group in

1144
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,880
some official manner

1145
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,200
and ask them to

1146
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,040
to engage and evaluate

1147
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,480
uh with the work

1148
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,920
um

1149
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
and i think that the answer is yes once

1150
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,640
we have a concrete proposal we do not

1151
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,599
really

1152
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,560
yet

1153
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,720
but uh but if this is

1154
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,880
if this is a worthwhile direction

1155
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,400
um then i think that that's where uh

1156
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,839
that's where it would be really valuable

1157
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,079
i guess we might have something concrete

1158
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,200
to ask about with the uh with the

1159
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,520
security considerations but

1160
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,160
uh i think it was a fair point that that

1161
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,280
um

1162
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,040
they want to have

1163
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,800
an actual proposal for the protocol

1164
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,640
where we're proposing

1165
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,400
uh for

1166
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,480
transporting web traffic over multicast

1167
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,000
in order to consider

1168
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,800
um and that that is like it's it's hard

1169
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,000
to

1170
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,319
really get good security considerations

1171
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,880
in the abstract so uh

1172
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,960
so it's a fair point but

1173
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,200
um you know i i i leave that to uh

1174
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,200
to further questioning really

1175
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,680
um so that's all i've got so yeah how

1176
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,520
about lenny let's let's hear what you

1177
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,839
have to say

1178
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,440
sounds good to me nothing um

1179
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,480
i

1180
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,400
i think you covered it all you answered

1181
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,960
my questions so

1182
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,359
okay um questions questions from anyone

1183
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,640
else uh for jake

1184
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,480
so let me ask warren uh

1185
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,920
you said you were hoping i had a good

1186
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,560
idea i don't know if this is a good idea

1187
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,839
it's an idea

1188
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,319
so yeah we're in quarry google yeah i

1189
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,240
mean at least it's an idea i don't know

1190
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,599
of a better one

1191
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,200
um

1192
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,720
other than just like continuing to

1193
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,480
people this is the best idea ever and

1194
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,920
hope that they pay attention so yeah i

1195
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,680
don't know

1196
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,720
yeah

1197
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,920
um

1198
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,839
i i really do think that that the

1199
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,560
interest level will rise if there are

1200
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,319
isps that are doing delivery of

1201
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,319
interdomain multicast

1202
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,280
my take is that uh

1203
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,200
you know right now there's there's high

1204
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,680
skepticism that this will actually end

1205
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,040
up getting deployed

1206
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,800
uh so i think the deployment work is the

1207
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,520
key to this um to getting that that

1208
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,720
engagement

1209
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,560
uh there might be more because

1210
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,760
the web security people are

1211
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,000
um

1212
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,599
they've had a lot of people pushing on

1213
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,280
them about security considerations that

1214
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,079
they

1215
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,000
that they don't agree with and this does

1216
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,400
expose information to the network in

1217
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,960
ways that make them uncomfortable um we

1218
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,839
tried to address all that in the

1219
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,359
security considerations document and i

1220
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,560
think it's

1221
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,280
a reasonable way to look at things but

1222
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,240
yeah we'll we'll have to see

1223
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,640
sandy i saw you in the queue i think

1224
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,160
or i'm muting maybe no

1225
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,040
because i see that you you will

1226
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,640
implement the multicast over creek so uh

1227
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,160
if multicaster will implement it we with

1228
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,319
quick so the

1229
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,839
will the

1230
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:39,359
amt still be used forever or um

1231
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,240
every

1232
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,000
multicultural will be on quick

1233
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,680
uh so amt would still be used for the

1234
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,440
inner domain transport

1235
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,720
wherever there's not um a multicast

1236
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,800
capable peering

1237
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,040
uh that that does the so it's um

1238
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,119
so the way that the uh

1239
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,920
the amt would still be used is

1240
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,520
in quick you would tell the client that

1241
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,680
hey client please join this multicast

1242
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,559
group

1243
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,000
um and then the client would join that

1244
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,680
multicast group and then you have your

1245
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,520
regular uh how are you going to

1246
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,880
transport that multicast how are you

1247
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,319
going to do the rpf how are you going to

1248
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,000
get it

1249
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,440
transmitted

1250
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,720
question that we always have with

1251
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,839
multicast right um so this can use amt

1252
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,079
it can also use uh not amt and and b

1253
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:30,880
you know

1254
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,280
it should work just fine for

1255
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,040
connecting to

1256
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,720
traffic that's sourced within the

1257
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,359
network but it also would work uh with

1258
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,000
the dryad extension um

1259
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,920
or or with

1260
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,359
in theory with the well-known ip if

1261
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,640
there's anybody running those relays

1262
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,559
to ingest the traffic from outside the

1263
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,240
network

1264
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,599
so

1265
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,160
we still intend to start with

1266
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,800
amt access for inter-domain transport

1267
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,119
but it's it should work to do other

1268
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,400
kinds of transport as well

1269
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,480
okay thank you

1270
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,400
okay

1271
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,079
i don't see any other questions for jake

1272
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,240
any better ideas

1273
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,319
i don't love this i don't love this plan

1274
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,760
i wish i had something a little bit

1275
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,359
better than well

1276
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,200
first i'll go implement a whole quick

1277
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,480
extension and then i'll hope that they

1278
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,800
like it

1279
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,280
but it's what i've got so

1280
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,599
it's at least if you build it too

1281
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,480
if you build it they will come

1282
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,280
how long have you been saying that lenny

1283
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,160
[Laughter]

1284
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,880
i guess it's the

1285
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,760
appliance as a broken a broken clock is

1286
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,920
is right twice a day so at some point

1287
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,920
we're going to be right about that

1288
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,240
almost long enough that's the answer yes

1289
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,800
almost long enough all right um how

1290
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,440
about uh bad idea whose time has come i

1291
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,599
don't know that's

1292
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,200
no i you know

1293
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,480
people don't think this is gonna work

1294
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,559
but i think that we're really

1295
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,119
getting a crunch on capacity

1296
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,520
in some ways um you know

1297
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,839
maybe there will be a renaissance in the

1298
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,079
layer one transport at the last mile and

1299
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,559
it will make all this obsolete but um

1300
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,280
i don't see it happening so

1301
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,119
i don't know how else we're gonna get

1302
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,520
that the level of demand covered for

1303
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,240
these peak events

1304
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,119
yeah i i think it's worth noting that

1305
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,880
we're about to

1306
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,559
have a perhaps an inflection point uh

1307
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,720
for this topic um

1308
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,040
with the nfl um

1309
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
this this fall

1310
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,760
uh where amazon prime has

1311
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,240
exclusive rights to streaming of

1312
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,920
thursday night football games and you're

1313
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,839
going to have audiences of 20 to 40

1314
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:00,880
million

1315
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,800
simultaneous viewers for three hours a

1316
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,599
week

1317
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,319
for

1318
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,520
16 weeks a year 16 17 weeks a year

1319
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,960
and um

1320
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,200
you know the other doing that purely

1321
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,280
with unicast is is

1322
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,280
really going to be challenging so it's i

1323
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,079
think we're at an interesting point

1324
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,040
i think we may have passed the

1325
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,040
inflection point in some places there

1326
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,119
was a similar situation with the zone in

1327
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,240
italy

1328
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,119
uh that really began last year i think

1329
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,760
where they got rights to syria a which

1330
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,200
is the um

1331
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,559
you know the italian football uh

1332
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,400
most popular team

1333
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,599
and um

1334
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,680
they

1335
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,200
you know there's there's been a lot of

1336
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,079
uh

1337
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,160
press about how that went

1338
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,359
um

1339
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,400
and uh they they did do some attempt to

1340
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,760
address it with multicast as i

1341
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,000
understand it but

1342
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,359
but

1343
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,040
it seems like it wasn't enough according

1344
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,280
to the statements they made

1345
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,680
last november

1346
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,680
multicast helped a lot

1347
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,400
but

1348
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,079
they still have a ways to go because it

1349
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,839
was only in one network

1350
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:06,960
and uh

1351
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,599
and they needed to do uh to get kind of

1352
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,000
more to really meet this

1353
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,079
make it satisfactory to their end users

1354
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,359
so

1355
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,800
i think we're past the inflection point

1356
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,000
really

1357
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,440
but there's still

1358
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,960
open questions on how it's going to land

1359
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,839
anyway that's uh that's all kind of

1360
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,960
not really protocol work

1361
