1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,120
i knew somebody had a conflict

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,560
okay

3
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,840
you want to do it go for it

4
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,239
so

5
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,240
yes

6
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,800
you

7
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,599
this is

8
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,799
well we can

9
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,239
we can try and make somebody else work

10
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,760
so you can you know

11
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,239
go see the city

12
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,319
but sometimes

13
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,880
okay

14
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,040
number two

15
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,400
there's also one trance

16
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,520
doesn't change

17
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800

half of our conversation here at the

21
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,319
front desk because the mic was on the

22
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,840
whole time

23
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,199

what's on there if not please make

37
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,199
yourself familiar with that

38
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,680
this is the rules uh um how we work

39
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,400
together and contribute here in the ietf

40
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479
there's also a link to the code of

41
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,400
conduct so this is also something that i

42
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,319
would like to have everybody on their

43
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,160
mind that we work together in a

44
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
constructive and friendly way

45
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,520
in this meeting and in all other

46
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,919
meetings

47
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,680
okay um what is ib open uh maybe you

48
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,199
have an idea about this because you are

49
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,080
already in the room um but our idea

50
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,800
about this is that we as the ib really

51
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,479
want to have some interchange with the

52
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,560
community we would like to give you a

53
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,080
good impression about what we're doing

54
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,520
especially from the technical point of

55
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,720
view

56
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,680
and

57
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
i just lost connectivity but

58
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,919
from a from a technical point of view

59
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,160
you can stick with the previous slide um

60
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
but we're also looking for actually

61
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,199
getting feedback from you and having an

62
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,639
exchange in communication with the

63
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,479
communities so thank you for being here

64
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,720
next slide um this is also mainly kind

65
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,039
of for the proceedings just to make sure

66
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,520
uh beyond this session how you that you

67
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
know how to interact with us we have a

68
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,800
couple of mailing lists

69
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,039
um the easiest way to reach the iap is

70
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
just send an email to the iab be aware

71
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,199
that um this mailing list has a few more

72
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,960
people than just the core ib so that's

73
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,879
why this is listed on here

74
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,560
um you can also send an email to me or

75
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,280
any ib member individually if you want

76
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
like an open mailing list with community

77
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
discussion um it's best to go to

78
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,680
architecture just discuss this is also

79
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,000
hosted by the iab and we use it for

80
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,519
various cases

81
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,440
um there's a bunch of mailing lists for

82
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,880
not a bunch because we only have two

83
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,559
programs there's our programs related

84
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,039
meetings for most specific topics

85
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
and if you have any kind of questions

86
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,240
feedback um or other things related to

87
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,320
liaisons we have an own mailing list

88
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
there

89
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
um that's the easiest way to reach the

90
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,760
right people in the irb

91
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
okay

92
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,959
next slide

93
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,040
okay now we're starting um a little bit

94
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,120
of just like an official reporting about

95
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,279
what we're doing in terms of documents

96
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,279
workshops and programs

97
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,760
and i will start with this slide on the

98
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
the documents we are working on what we

99
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,200
have published recently

100
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,519
um so we did publish one rc since the

101
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,120
last meeting um that was

102
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,720
a lot of discussion about this was in

103
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,040
the edm program but we also it was also

104
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,800
presented in this ibo meeting at some

105
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
point i think

106
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,880
um so that's out and published

107
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,959
we adopted a new document in the iab

108
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,200
since the last meeting that's the ib

109
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,320
um

110
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
past signals collaboration draft

111
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,399
and there's some discussion ongoing on

112
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,800
the architecture discussion list so if

113
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,480
you're interested in that work um that's

114
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,839
the right mailing list and we're happy

115
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,640
to get your feedback on this

116
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,839
um

117
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,560
there is the output of the roc

118
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
editor program

119
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,959
which is ready to be published

120
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,880
and i will say more about this on one of

121
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
the next slides

122
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,640
and there is one document which is under

123
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,600
discussion by the edm program this is

124
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,160
already an iap document which has been

125
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
around for more than two years i think

126
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,920
but it hasn't made a lot of progress but

127
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
there's some work on this going on again

128
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,279
so hopefully we can publish that at some

129
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,200
point

130
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,519
there's uh one new workshop report and

131
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,440
we will hear about this next and there's

132
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
an update on the

133
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,279
workshop report from our workshop last

134
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,079
summer about network measurements

135
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,839
or network quality measurements i guess

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
yeah program updates

137
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,760
so uh we have

138
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,920
two to three technical programs i would

139
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
say

140
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,680
sure

141
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,399
let's try this one we have uh two to

142
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,320
three technical programs one of them is

143
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,600
edm

144
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,480
and

145
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,399
they presented a lot of their discussion

146
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,560
and work over the last couple of ib open

147
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,079
meetings and this time we only have a

148
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,800
quick um one slide update

149
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,519
so as i just mentioned um rfc 9170 is

150
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,279
published and that was discussed and

151
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,880
worked in this program

152
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,560
and there was an interim meeting of this

153
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,720
program beginning of february

154
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,880
where they talked about this related

155
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,480
implementation text so that's something

156
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,839
that is already in the data track and

157
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,760
you can use it in order to make it

158
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,839
easier to find um related

159
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,279
implementations

160
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,160
code

161
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,760
for interrupt testing and these kind of

162
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,519
things so this is something new in the

163
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,880
data tracker that came out of the

164
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,800
discussion of the program

165
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,880
and then they are working on this other

166
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,800
draft about protocol maintenance that i

167
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,279
was also mentioning earlier on

168
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,959
so if you have any input on the second

169
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,360
graph here then this is the program and

170
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,640
the program writing this is the right

171
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,040
place to go

172
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,360

179
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,360
a program looking at the changes on the

180
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
treadmills

181
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
um in the in the internet uh we had an

182
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,519
entry meeting um

183
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,440
after the previous itf

184
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,480
we've had

185
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,040
actually three documents being updated

186
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,360
since last time there's been some

187
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,440
discussion on mail it's not a huge

188
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
amount but

189
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
some and

190
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,399
i think we're converting on

191
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,839
trying to publish a couple documents on

192
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,639
we call principles or documents uh

193
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,720
describing principles

194
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,800
around data minimization and involvement

195
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
of intermediaries

196
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,519
um the work remains on that and also we

197
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,600
have a bigger question of do we actually

198
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
want to update the official ietf threat

199
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,120
model which

200
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,519
you know the iab to begin with cannot do

201
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,639
and and exactly what lengths shall we go

202
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,560
to do that and so on

203
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,040
that that remains to be decided you can

204
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,320
participate in the discussion on the

205
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,800
main list uh the link is here

206
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
and we have a poll for the next meeting

207
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
time up uh on the on the mailing list

208
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,480
right now so

209
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,839
planning to do that in the next couple

210
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,000
of weeks

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,519
it

212
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,160
thanks yari

213
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,360
okay and then our

214
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
third program and i cannot see any

215
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,079
screen

216
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,440
this one yeah now i can see

217
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,000
um so our third program uh this is a

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,440
little bit a different program that's an

219
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,160
ib program but it was um really

220
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
run like an open working group for

221
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,360
everybody to participate participate and

222
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,079
we left the process on their own and

223
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,720
we're just committed to host that

224
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,959
and and take their output and the good

225
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,720
news is and i already announced this in

226
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
the planner yesterday but just to spread

227
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,000
the news a little bit more and the

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,920
program basically concluded their work

229
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,600
so they finished um the draft and they

230
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
headed back to the iab for iab approval

231
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,800
the iab made a four weeks community last

232
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,279
call in order to reach out to um more of

233
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,959
the community get different reviews in

234
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,360
and we triggered a lot of reviews and

235
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,320
and got some final feedback made mostly

236
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,220
editorial small changes um

237
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,440
[Music]

238
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
so i'm very confident that this is in a

239
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,680
good shape now and we are ready to

240
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,360
publish that basically

241
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
there is a dependency from the model

242
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
itself to three other drafts which are

243
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,760
on the ietf stream and which are updates

244
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,480
to existing process documents

245
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,839
um these have have already been on the

246
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,880
iesg agenda

247
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,639
but then we discovered like a small

248
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,480
update that is still needed to the iap

249
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,800
charter so this update to the ib charter

250
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,360
goes through another itf um working

251
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
group not working group last call itf

252
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,560
last call

253
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,440
and as soon as and and we'll also get um

254
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
additional approval by isoc by the isup

255
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
board because they approved the ib

256
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,959
charter in the first place so we asked

257
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,040
them to take a look at this again

258
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
just to check and with everybody who

259
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
could be related here

260
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,519
um but as soon as that document is ready

261
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,760
basically the whole set of documents is

262
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,279
ready

263
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,720
the whole set of why is it working

264
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
yeah okay

265
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,079
something's just changed i don't know

266
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,839
what

267
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
maybe they did okay um so the whole set

268
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
of documents should be ready

269
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,199
uh and go out very soon in a few weeks

270
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,680
um so at this point it's merely a thank

271
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,279
you for ever to everybody who was

272
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,959
involved especially the chairs the

273
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,760
editor but also everybody who

274
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
provided feedback in the mailing list

275
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,160
was um involved in the discussion and

276
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,839
provided reviews thank you very much

277
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,079
this was a lot of effort but at the end

278
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,160
we managed to work together productively

279
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,839
and i think got a good output here

280
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,120
yeah and then we will close down the

281
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,759
program at some point

282
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,240
okay leonardo updates um not sure wes if

283
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,920
you want to take this one if you are

284
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,279
here

285
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,320
yes

286
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,399
i am here and i agreed to do it so i

287
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,800
should do it um so

288
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,880
as everybody may remember

289
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,759
the ieb is responsible for the liaison

290
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,920
outreach or at least overseeing the lazy

291
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,440
and outreaches to a lot of other

292
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,279
standards organizations

293
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,759
we created a liaison coordinator role in

294
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,680
the last year and

295
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,079
tommy and i have been fulfilling that

296
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,120
role

297
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
i will

298
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,399
step down and deborah will actually take

299
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,440
over

300
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,120
but this is essentially the liaison

301
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,279
updates for what has happened at least

302
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,680
recently since the last ietf it is worth

303
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,920
noting that in the future we actually

304
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,639
hope to have uh sort of more mini

305
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,560
presentations in the iab open meeting or

306
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,920
something we've been discussing lately

307
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,160
so if you're interested in hearing more

308
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,759
about you know a particular standards

309
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,440
organization or other we may start

310
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,279
dedicating some time we'd love to love

311
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,880
your feedback on that

312
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,839
um the multi-stakeholder platform

313
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,480
on ict standardization is up for renewal

314
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,800
uh we need um

315
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,040
we need to fill that role

316
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,480
the the icann s-sec has published 113

317
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
which calls for the icann board to

318
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
ensure a dns label is reserved for

319
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,399
private use this has been heavily

320
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,720
discussed in the past in dns op and in

321
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,880
other places as well

322
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,640
the the ietf has the um the oversight of

323
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,439
special uses names and there's a lack of

324
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,359
clarity on exactly who should

325
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,280
be creating a name that might be used

326
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,799
for private label space in the same way

327
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,959
that we have private address space uh

328
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,559
there exists nothing at the moment and a

329
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,640
lot of companies and organizations squat

330
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,799
on names so uh look forward to

331
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,119
discussions on that both then i can end

332
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,599
the atf

333
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,160
the uh stuart did you have a question

334
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,600
related to liaisons

335
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,160
uh just uh wanted to mention that the

336
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,919
drip working group is probably going to

337
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,000
need some help establishing liaison with

338
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
astm international and international

339
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,160
civil aviation organization

340
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
okay great uh why don't you write the

341
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,240
ieb with a note of of what you think you

342
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
need and things like that and then we

343
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
will certainly reach out to you so but

344
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,799
go ahead and write iab ib.org and we'll

345
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,559
all get to see it so

346
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,080
you can write the liaison coordinators

347
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,919
directly if you want to but for

348
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,880
something like that we're going to have

349
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,160
a discussion anyway so you might as well

350
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,480
write the entire iab

351
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,400
uh the icann

352
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,160
root server system advisory committee

353
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
which is rsac

354
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,039
is seeking you know information on

355
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,480
um

356
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,440
the

357
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,600
their plans in order to publish the zone

358
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,559
md record which is a record designed

359
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,320
within the ietf for

360
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,480
providing a checksum on the entire root

361
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,080
zone content so that you can be aware

362
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,960
that you got the entire file as well as

363
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,880
there's no missing records in the entire

364
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,360
thing for large scale data transfers

365
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,710
used especially in things like

366
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,960
[Music]

367
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,360
rfc 8806 which is a local copy of the

368
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,039
root zone for example to ensure that you

369
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,320
have a complete

370
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,280
file

371
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,360
it's used well in conjunction with dnsec

372
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,679
it's not a replacement for it

373
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,400
and then our seco 58 is success criteria

374
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
for the root service system governance

375
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,280
model

376
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,160
which a while ago icann took on the role

377
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,200
of right now the root server system is

378
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,520
consists of 12 organizations that don't

379
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,280
have an overarching governance model

380
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,440
over them and then

381
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,120
icann has been thinking for a number of

382
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,280
years now about how to create such a

383
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,080
thing and they created the gwg

384
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,880
ted hardy is and

385
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,919
jeff houston have been our iab liaisons

386
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,760
to the gwg

387
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,240
ted unfortunately has to step down he

388
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
would actually has been the chair of the

389
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,919
gwd and has done an excellent job and we

390
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,320
certainly thank ted for his service we

391
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,039
are looking for a replacement the

392
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,919
deadline for volunteering for um such a

393
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,880
role is monday the

394
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,440
march say sorry april 4th

395
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,160
2022 obviously so please do consider

396
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,840
volunteering for that role if you have

397
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
interest in overseeing

398
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,160
and helping create sort of the next root

399
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
server system governance model

400
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,760
any questions

401
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
barry

402
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,520
now this is barry lieber i'm on sac and

403
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,720
was in the

404
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,760
work party that developed sac 113.

405
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,200
i just wanted to clarify something

406
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,640
because it's my understanding from what

407
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,919
we wrote that this is not in the ietf's

408
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,000
territory anymore that the ietf clearly

409
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
said you didn't want to go there

410
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,600
so

411
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
this is a just a request to the icann

412
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
board to take care of this

413
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,640
so i'm sure there'll still be

414
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,559
discussions within the ietf but i don't

415
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,880
think anybody's asking the ietf to take

416
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,640
any action at this point

417
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,039
is that your understanding as well

418
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,720
that is my understanding that being said

419
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
the icann board has actually talked to

420
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,039
the iab about getting advice on how to

421
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,120
do this sort of thing so

422
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,000
uh

423
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
there still is sort of some confusion in

424
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,480
terms of of what the icann board can do

425
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,039
without the ietf's help even if it's not

426
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,320
the ats belly wick it's a weird problem

427
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,559
okay thanks for the clarification

428
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,919
yeah we could discuss that all day as

429
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,360
you well know leemon

430
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,960
so uh lars sleeman here uh from net node

431
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,400
one of the root server operators and

432
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,720
also a member of the gwg from the root

433
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,159
server side

434
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,320
i

435
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,960
the root service system advisory

436
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
committee and i can

437
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,200
ask the icon board to create this

438
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,280
working group and asked it specifically

439
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,440
to be very inclusive

440
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
because

441
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,039
the root server operators per se did not

442
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
want to create their own future they

443
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,320
didn't want to be king makers of

444
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,600
themselves

445
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,120
so therefore we

446
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,080
reached out to a wider community and

447
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,000
there is a lot of representation inside

448
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,320
the icon community itself

449
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,480
but there are also certain aspects

450
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,640
especially the technical ones where we

451
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,440
would

452
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,640
value the input from technical community

453
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,919
if if

454
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,320
even if it's not more than sitting there

455
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,039
with the your foot on the brake pedal

456
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,480
when we're heading in the totally wrong

457
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
directions that that would be valuable

458
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,400
in itself so

459
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
please consider applying for this

460
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
position and please

461
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
help us to to

462
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
maintain a relationship with the technic

463
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,720
technical community thank you

464
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,840
yeah thank you

465
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,760
uh very well put full disclosure i'm a

466
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,480
root server operator too for uscisi

467
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,440
um

468
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,760
one other point of comment which is that

469
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,799
the

470
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,520
whatever comes out of the gwg will be a

471
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,080
public document um published by icann

472
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,360
when that will mean that it will go

473
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,520
through a comment period and as lemon

474
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,000
just indicated the wider review of such

475
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
a document the better

476
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,240
with that i believe i am done with this

477
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,559
slide

478
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,280
thank you

479
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,440
so that is the reporting part here and

480
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,840
we can start with the fun part

481
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,640
uh we have one more report

482
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,960
sorry but maybe more detailed one about

483
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
our last workshop when analyzing ietf

484
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,039
data and these will take this and then

485
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,039
the rest of the session we have some

486
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,120
time to discuss about centralization

487
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,480
that is a topic

488
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,799
that comes up very often

489
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,559
um and there's a lot of community

490
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,840
interest it's also topic that's

491
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
discussed a lot in the iab and we have

492
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,840
like a couple of small presentations to

493
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
kind of set the stage but hopefully

494
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,760
we'll have enough time for community

495
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,640
discussion after the presentations yes

496
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,039

okay let me try

499
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,360

i'm here to report back on the analyzing

506
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,919
ietf data workshop that we held already

507
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,960
in november december last year it was

508
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
hosted at the university of amsterdam

509
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,080
with a program committee of

510
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,039
colin perkins corinth cath myria cool

511
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,480
vince and bin li

512
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,200
and wes hardiker

513
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,039
our question was there is a

514
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,080
wealth of ietf data but how can this be

515
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,640
used to improve the ietf processes

516
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,159
create better standards that see more

517
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,720
implementation aid ietf leadership

518
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,039
authors and community members and

519
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,679
increase ietf legitimacy

520
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,200
and as a

521
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,760
subsidiary objective how to create a

522
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,240
community around the people that use

523
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,400
this data create tooling and make it

524
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,640
accessible for more people

525
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,720
and we did not come up on this on the

526
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,640
fly because also in the ietf

527
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,799
administrative strategic plan it says

528
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,240
that increasingly data should inform uh

529
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,080
policy making

530
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
and so what we did is that we organized

531
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,960
a hackathon which unfortunately due to

532
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,080
cove it was not on site but was online

533
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,480
we had a four-day workshop out of which

534
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
two were a hackathon also inspired on

535
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,200
the experiences we had at ietf with the

536
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,360
hackathon but thus far that wasn't done

537
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,159
during an iab workshop so on the first

538
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,200
day and the last day we had sessions but

539
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
on the middle two days we worked in

540
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,159
distributed groups on different issues

541
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,080
of which i will give a short overview

542
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,600
very short

543
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,760
so first we gave an overview of all the

544
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,919
itf data sources that there are such as

545
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,880
the mailing list archives the rfc index

546
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
the the data tracker and robert sparks

547
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,799
was there as well also provided an

548
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,600
excellent overview and uh shared some

549
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
notes that are definitely very useful to

550
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,720
review if you want to have a look at

551
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,159
this the ietf org web page visitor stats

552
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,919
github and interrupt testings and survey

553
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,159
data but this could also be combined

554
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,960
with data of other sdos to provide

555
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,880
more insights

556
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,039
and then the tools to analyze this there

557
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,400
are some really interesting tools that

558
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,120
are linked in the slides the ietf data

559
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,320
library as it has been developed by

560
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,679
colin perkis his team and his projects

561
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,080
the big bang project

562
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,240
that's been on this for a while rfc

563
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,039
prolog database and of course yari arcos

564
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,200
author stats and ietf document

565
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,039
statistics so there are a lot there's a

566
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,880
lot of data and a lot of tools to work

567
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,679
with

568
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,520
but uh

569
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,200
also a lot of things that we don't use

570
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,039
and don't know yet so that was also a

571
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,480
part of trying to understand what do we

572
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,039
know what can we do and what is lacking

573
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,960
in the first session we

574
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,159
observed

575
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,080
and tried to understand affiliations and

576
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,480
industry control in standardization try

577
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,840
to understand what are the relations

578
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,200
between corporate interest and

579
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
individual contributions and

580
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,000
competitions between leadership

581
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,080
and that really flowed up super nicely

582
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,480
in the hackathon on work done on initial

583
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,400
analysis on affiliation trends in mail

584
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,200
english participation a lot of work done

585
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,080
on a stakeholder analysis of stakeholder

586
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
categories and groups and initial

587
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,440
comparison between ietf and 3gpp data so

588
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,720
that uh

589
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,840
that resulted in some new data models

590
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,200
in uh some hand-picking of uh

591
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,600
of top contributors to several mailing

592
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,799
lists to to set a bit of a gold standard

593
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,440
then work by nick doty to see if that

594
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,520
could also be done

595
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,640
in an automated fashion and compare the

596
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,120
hand coded one with the automated coded

597
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,959
one and then some work by

598
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,240
sebastian benthal to see if we're from

599
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
mailing list data we could actually

600
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
retrieve

601
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,760
affiliation and then compare that also

602
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
with data tracker data and the

603
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,159
hand-picked data so there was a lot of

604
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,840
a lot of collaboration going on and

605
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,000
working there and then we could actually

606
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,919
use that data on uh 3gpp data so that

607
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,000
was really and this was the work done by

608
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,360
christoph becker so it's really

609
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,840
interesting how this opened this work on

610
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,640
itf data also opened insight into other

611
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,320
standards bodies

612
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,919
then another session was on community

613
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,679
and diversity

614
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,399
asking who is in the itf who is not

615
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,399
there what is the what is the existing

616
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,679
diversity

617
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,760
can trends and reasons for that be found

618
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,000
in data and what could be different if

619
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,399
diversity had been stronger

620
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,720
so any discussions and hacking we looked

621
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,080
at what could be measured and what

622
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,600
cannot be in existing tools but also in

623
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,279
uh

624
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,799
in current

625
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,360
nlp approaches the studying of general

626
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,120
identification country region

627
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,799
participation and tenure and

628
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,360
considerations of privacy and ethics

629
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,840
and initial results uh showed different

630
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,440
kinds of participation in different

631
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,120
groups

632
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
confirmed

633
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,039
something that we we already know about

634
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,399
a lack of diversity

635
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,200
in

636
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,679
during several meetings

637
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,919
and then another session looked at the

638
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,200
publication process and decision making

639
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,799
especially how decisions are made at the

640
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,120
ietf how can these decisions be studied

641
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,720
and how can these be used to improve

642
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,039
decision making and also help authors

643
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,600
and leadership make better choices and

644
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,679
to lead to how can we make better input

645
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,840
and output documents to understand who

646
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,640
writes the rfcs and how does this

647
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
contribute to them passing

648
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,279
uh try to understand do doing data

649
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,440
driven mining of homophilic users

650
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,039
requirements of natural language

651
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,000
processing to understand the

652
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,559
decision-making process a deployment

653
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,399
measurement of course so how does the

654
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,480
relationship between a successful rfc

655
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,320
and its deployment and measuring

656
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,279
efficient

657
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,240
efficiency development process so what

658
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,399
are common delays and also when does

659
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,120
working group last call take place

660
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,480
also there was some uh

661
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
some really interesting work being done

662
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,159
there and what i think are the most oh

663
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:30,960
sorry

664
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,559
and then some really interesting work on

665
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,240
environmental sustainability on which

666
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,320
not a lot of hacking has been done but

667
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
some really interesting papers were

668
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,960
presented on actually the lack of

669
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,000
discussion of sustainability in ietf

670
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,679
drafts but also the co2 emissions of

671
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,840
ietf meetings and how these could or

672
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,000
should be taking into consideration with

673
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,159
the environmental crisis right ahead of

674
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,600
us

675
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,559
so some observations is that there was

676
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,279
really well attended the papers were

677
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,960
really good were really a pleasure to

678
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,360
read and the participation was extremely

679
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,279
diverse iab members ietf leadership

680
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,279
social scientists data scientists

681
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,679
computer scientists and the mix of

682
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,640
sessions and hackathon

683
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,480
work really well so there were new

684
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,919
collaborations

685
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,760
code and tool chains were tried and

686
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
tested and people have are now using

687
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,600
each other's codes to write papers and

688
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,919
do things and new research questions

689
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,159
have been developed and i think that's

690
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,640
really nice so this also provided for

691
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,559
ourselves for a basis of our research

692
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,200
agenda for ietf data to inform future

693
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,760
research and development

694
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,320
there are people working in different

695
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,439
new collaborations

696
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,320
working on new papers and new workshops

697
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,080
but because it was so well and this

698
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,480
brought together such a unique group we

699
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,720
have a follow-up workshop under

700
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
discussion on this topic but that needs

701
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,080
further understanding of who can

702
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,960
organize what how the uh pandemic is

703
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,480
developing because it would be really

704
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,120
nice to do it in person and further

705
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,000
discussions with iab leadership

706
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,640
so if you want to have a thorough look

707
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,200
at who did what during the workshop

708
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,840
please have a look at the papers

709
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,519
but also at the slides that were

710
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,000
presented during the sessions but also

711
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,559
the outcomes of the hackathon also have

712
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,200
slides and these can be found on github

713
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,720
we have a draft report there it's a zero

714
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,840
zero

715
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,919
but here is the link to the github so

716
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,960
you can have pr's and comments etc and

717
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,080
there is also a video recording of the

718
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,640
whole workshop so if i missed anything

719
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,320
please other program committee members

720
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,720
of people who participate please add or

721
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,120
if there are any questions i'm happy to

722
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,960
seek to answer them or answer them

723
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,080
together with other people who are

724
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,200
present

725
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,240
thanks so much that was it from me

726
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,320
yeah thank you niels and yeah this was

727
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,919
really nice to see this was the first

728
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,360
time we had an ib workshop with a

729
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,640
hackathon

730
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,159
component and there was a lot of work

731
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,440
going on so

732
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,519
really nice workshop i think and we have

733
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,720
somebody in the queue elliott

734
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,600
good afternoon uh

735
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,279
good morning and good evening to you

736
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,399
colleagues

737
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,159
niels thanks for the update

738
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,080
on this workshop i

739
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,799
saw a lot of slides go by that explain

740
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,200
what transpired at the workshop and what

741
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,320
the next steps were i wonder if you or

742
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,880
other people who participated could take

743
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,320
just a moment

744
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
and and provide

745
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,360
maybe your top two or three insights in

746
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,440
terms of what you learned about how we

747
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,960
participate or

748
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,000
what what was confirmed or what what

749
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,120
misconceptions people had that the data

750
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,039
wore out not to be true

751
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,399
um could you comment on that

752
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,519
uh

753
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,519
yes but unfortunately not with a full

754
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,279
answer because people came in with

755
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,799
different research interests and

756
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,760
different questions and i think where we

757
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,640
uh

758
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
where we focused on was trying to

759
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,240
understand the data and the issues

760
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,080
people are working on to have an

761
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,679
understanding of the problem and

762
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,120
understand how the things could be

763
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,919
approached so we were by no means in

764
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,559
these days to a full understanding of uh

765
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,360
uh

766
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,919
of particular issues and i wouldn't want

767
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,840
to

768
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,159
uh talk for other participants to say

769
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,279
what are the conclusions of that

770
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,720
workshop that was definitely not the

771
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,399
nature of the workshop it was the first

772
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,399
time we we did this so i think like

773
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,559
establishing a community establishing a

774
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,720
research agenda establishing research

775
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,960
questions and it would be way too early

776
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,440
to say we would have answers to them but

777
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,200
what could be said is that some of the

778
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,120
code is now being used to try if we

779
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,480
could generate

780
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,240
dashboard kind of features similar such

781
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,320
to the ones author stats and document

782
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,279
stats is doing uh and a bit more of an

783
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,320
um

784
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,320
web interface to uh uh do data science

785
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
on uh

786
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,320
uh on mailing lists and standards but

787
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,559
that is also all future work so it

788
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,480
sparked a lot of interesting things but

789
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,359
answers are not done

790
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,520
yeah last second i was seconded so i

791
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,440
participated in this workshop as a as an

792
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,599
individual i guess and it was very much

793
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,760
like a workshop with the emphasis on the

794
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,359
work part right so this is not like

795
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,960
where you see a joint statement come out

796
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,879
at the end or something so this is about

797
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,320
getting people together oftentimes for

798
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,760
the first time and trying to understand

799
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
what everybody like has as an interest

800
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,239
and has us data and has his motivation

801
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,599
and i kind of expect this will be sort

802
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,280
of an ongoing thing in some way and i

803
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,399
don't know if it's always going to be an

804
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,000
ib workshop or if there's some other way

805
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
to continue this but it's

806
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,239
certainly not done after after this one

807
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,560
event right but it's it's really helpful

808
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,639
um to put in the leadership cap on to

809
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,320
have actually data about a bunch of

810
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,280
stuff

811
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,960
especially during covet where it's sort

812
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,760
of

813
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,960
very difficult to get a sense from the

814
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,239
community because there's no physical

815
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,520
meeting where you bump into people and

816
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,119
it'll tell you things right so we're

817
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,480
trying to

818
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,440
um

819
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,599
get some some insight into what we

820
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,599
should do in terms of decisions through

821
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,160
efforts like this

822
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,118
thanks for organizing

823
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,280
hello this is shane um

824
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,760
this is very cool

825
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,240
i wonder if during the work

826
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,160
if there was a lot of attention given to

827
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,640
areas where it was difficult to extract

828
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,000
information out of the data that you

829
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,800
have

830
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,560
like is it's part of the intention to

831
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,400
make recommendations for

832
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,880
additional metadata or additional

833
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,160
data data

834
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,839
for for researchers or other people

835
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,079
excellent question so what what i think

836
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,040
was the preliminary analysis is that

837
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,480
data tracker

838
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,160
very nice

839
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,920
mailing lists very hard very messy

840
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
but what is the advantage of mailing

841
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,079
list is that many other organizations

842
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,240
also have mailing lists and many other

843
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,320
organizations don't have data tracker so

844
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,400
that makes them comparison harder but

845
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,560
then we could try to see if we can

846
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,960
enhance the um

847
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,200
the the mailing list data with the data

848
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,520
tracker data and then see if we can just

849
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,920
improve our whole thing there was also a

850
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,040
talk and discussion in some

851
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,880
presentations on um

852
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,720
on knowledge graphs

853
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,000
and

854
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
how that and how machine learning can

855
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,160
inform this process but that that was

856
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,400
still also also a presentation about how

857
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
many things did not work as well as

858
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,599
people hope

859
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,760
so um

860
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
so that continues to be

861
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,720
work

862
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,160
there is a thing of course also in the

863
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
data tracker that many things are text

864
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,240
fields and not drop down so you have

865
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,240
many many different ways of even just

866
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,400
spelling cisco cisco systems with

867
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,950
capitalism you know so and um

868
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,240
[Music]

869
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
so there were there were challenges and

870
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
what was so nice is that

871
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,119
that robert and others were there so

872
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,720
yeah it really felt like we were hacking

873
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,960
on a common problem so it was i didn't

874
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
feel like research community needed to

875
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,720
request leadership to tell the tools

876
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,320
people no it was like we were really

877
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,079
like i'm trying to understand and

878
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,839
wrapping our head out where we're going

879
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,480
what we're missing what we have

880
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,040
cool thank you

881
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,320
okay thank you niels

882
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,599
yeah we now have like four small

883
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,880
presentations let's take the

884
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,079
presentations and then have the

885
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,520
discussion afterwards because we're

886
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,839
already a little bit behind time but i'm

887
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,480
actually not sure for this presentation

888
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,119
if either matt or carl is in the room

889
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,960
i didn't see them in the list

890
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,280
um

891
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
yeah so then we actually

892
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,720
we gained some time but on that

893
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,040
presentation so that is work from isoc

894
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,960
um that did some market analysis about

895
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,400
centralization

896
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,359
and

897
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,960
as we don't have the presenters here

898
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,400
it's probably much easier for you to

899
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,040
just go on the isoc webpage and look at

900
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,440
all the data there firsthand it's very

901
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,359
interesting and it doesn't it does

902
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,440
contribute to this discussion

903
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,280
okay then uh no this is the wrong

904
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,200
presentation

905
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,000
the next should be from viet

906
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,359
who also did uh some measurements so

907
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,040
let's start with that part

908
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,119
yeah yes hello everyone

909
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,440
i think i still need control over the

910
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,440
slides

911
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
exactly cool thanks perfect so yeah

912
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,320
hello everyone my name is viet from

913
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,839
technology university of munich and

914
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,359
today i have the honor to present our

915
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,760
measurement study on web consolidation

916
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,839
here at the iab open meeting

917
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,160
this paper is covered by roland oliver

918
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,760
weipov and

919
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,480
was recently published in toit you can

920
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,160
find a link to the paper and all the

921
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,760
measurement related material on our

922
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,920
github repository as well as contact

923
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,200
information in case you have any

924
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
questions

925
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,680
so

926
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,520
as already mentioned before

927
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,119
in the recent years you've probably also

928
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,200
seen that there has been increasing

929
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,280
demand for measurement studies on

930
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
internet centralization in particular

931
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,480
why is that

932
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,920
essentially because there are differing

933
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,160
opinions and views about centralization

934
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,359
on one hand

935
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,440
centralization obviously facilitates the

936
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,520
deployment of the protocols

937
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,280
on the other hand it makes it

938
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,920
somewhat risky for privacy and

939
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
is a concentration of control which is

940
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,839
obviously another good thing in a lot of

941
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,720
ways

942
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,599
and

943
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,920
that in a sense also makes difficult to

944
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,079
define centralization and to understand

945
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,560
and assess the extent

946
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,440
and implications of centralization

947
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,960
in the recent years there have been some

948
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,680
studies on centralization on dns

949
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,079
third-party dependencies and co-location

950
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,079
of services and in our paper in

951
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,400
particular we look at web consolidation

952
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,240
around what we call content delivery

953
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,240
infrastructures which is basically a

954
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,119
term which subsumes cdn and cloud hosts

955
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,480
under one term

956
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,480
cdis for short

957
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,960
so what we first did in our paper is we

958
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,119
looked at longitudinal dns measurements

959
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,000
for all domains in the dot com.net and

960
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,720
dot org uh namespaces which were more

961
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,280
than 160 million and we found that the

962
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,680
cdi penetration has increased from

963
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,599
roughly eight percent to

964
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,960
nearly double with 15 in 2020.

965
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,400
um 15 in this case means that 15 of the

966
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,319
websites that we looked at

967
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,160
out of all the measured ones

968
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,880
were

969
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,480
hosted on a cdi

970
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,000
and note that

971
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,560
the cdi identification is obviously not

972
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,960
an exhaustive identification but it

973
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,520
covers most of the um

974
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
prominent providers that are out there

975
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,680
so this can be seen as a

976
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,319
lower bound one could say

977
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,800
the next part we then looked at

978
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,200
popular landing pages in based on the

979
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,520
alexa top 1 million top list and see

980
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,319
that the overall penetration

981
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,160
is roughly 24 over pv4 and roughly 12

982
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,000
over ipv6

983
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,800
with more popular domains obviously

984
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
having a higher penetration since these

985
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,000
websites

986
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,240
are simply facing more traffic and

987
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,880
are in more need of this

988
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,280
infrastructure so to speak

989
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,440
in the bottom plot you can see the

990
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,839
contribution of providers in this case

991
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,920
only the top providers in this case to

992
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,000
the overall penetration and you can see

993
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,880
that

994
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,480
it's only a handful of providers that

995
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,920
make up the

996
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,160
most amount of

997
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,000
contribution to this overall penetration

998
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,319
in particular over ipv6 where we see

999
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,319
that uh for instance for the alexa top

1000
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,760
100 000 um for ipv6 cloudflare

1001
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,960
contributes um roughly 80 of the

1002
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,560
pages of all cdi hosted pages so

1003
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,079
while there is some concentration that

1004
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,520
you can see there

1005
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,599
it definitely helps with in this case

1006
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,160
pushing ipv6

1007
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,560
we then also went beyond landing pages

1008
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,880
where we looked at page resources

1009
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,200
for that we used page load measurements

1010
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,520
from the hp archive which covered more

1011
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,920
than 4 million websites and roughly 400

1012
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
million resources and we saw that

1013
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,240
roughly one-third of the pages were

1014
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,720
hosted on a cdi

1015
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,880
and in contrast more than 50 of the

1016
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,200
resources that were loaded with together

1017
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,800
with the pages were actually coming from

1018
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,560
a cdi

1019
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,319
um in the top table right here you can

1020
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,040
see that google and amazon in particular

1021
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,839
account for together more than 50 of the

1022
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,040
cdi hosted resources so while

1023
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,359
more than half of the resources in total

1024
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,800
come from the cdi um more than 50

1025
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,400
currently come from google and amazon in

1026
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,960
particular so there's definitely some um

1027
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,119
you could say top heavy distribution

1028
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,560
there

1029
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,960
in the bottom table you can also see

1030
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,280
the penetration by resource type which

1031
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,760
is especially high for static resources

1032
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,079
which is sort of expected since

1033
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,160
cdns in particular are used for

1034
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,480
distribution of static resources a lot

1035
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,560
um however we see for instance that

1036
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
fonts have 86 percent of our cdi

1037
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,800
penetration which is definitely a very

1038
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,960
high number and in our paper we also

1039
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,000
cover case studies on cdi penetration

1040
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,319
which is also similarly high for ads and

1041
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,160
trackers and for tls 1.3 support

1042
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,640
to briefly conclude this

1043
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,520
as

1044
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,040
mentioned this is just a brief overview

1045
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,240
of our paper

1046
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,560
we have seen that the consolidation of

1047
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,319
webpages around certain cdis has

1048
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,359
increased by roughly double since 2015

1049
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,960
and that most of the resources are

1050
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,680
delivered from just a handful of ci's

1051
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,079
mostly

1052
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,400
this obviously also means that um there

1053
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,319
are some risks with this but on the

1054
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,480
other hand it also helps with the

1055
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,319
deployment and support of iphone 6 and

1056
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,000
tls 1.3 as we've briefly showed

1057
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,160
um also as media has mentioned before

1058
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,640
there was some um quite some discussion

1059
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,160
on the architectural discuss making list

1060
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,240
which i definitely recommend you to have

1061
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,680
a look into if you're more interested in

1062
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,480
that

1063
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,720
um i've put some of the

1064
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,040
i guess main questions and comments from

1065
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,960
the discussion here on the slide

1066
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,079
and i guess the most important or most

1067
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,920
interesting one would be what is the

1068
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,200
impact of and on itf activities

1069
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,440
around all the centralization and i

1070
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,839
believe mark has some comments on this

1071
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,680
on the next talk so unless there are any

1072
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,960
questions

1073
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,400
um

1074
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,480
i would conclude here

1075
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,000
yeah we have somebody in the cube but i

1076
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,119
would actually like to go through the

1077
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,359
other presentations quickly and then we

1078
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,800
take the question so christians just

1079
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,920
stay in the queue and then you can just

1080
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,200
you can just unmute yourself when

1081
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,720
there's a question coming up any time

1082
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,670
later okay perfect thanks

1083
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,880
[Music]

1084
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,599
okay mark

1085
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,240
yeah you are up and you should be able

1086
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,520
to

1087
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,800
move yourself can you can you hear me

1088
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,480
yes

1089
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,880
okay how do i control these slides oh i

1090
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,960
see interesting okay

1091
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,760
weird okay um i don't think i'm gonna

1092
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,920
need 10 minutes here but we'll see so um

1093
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,599
this is just a quick update on a draft

1094
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,599
i've been working on for a little while

1095
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,520
uh draft nottingham avoiding internet

1096
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,960
centralization although the title is

1097
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,440
centralization and internet standards

1098
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,280
um there we go

1099
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,640
so the purpose and then a bit of the

1100
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,880
history here uh this was inspired by a

1101
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,800
draft that brian trammell and i started

1102
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,520
uh when we were both on the iab

1103
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,680
about chuck points on the internet uh

1104
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,599
before this became quite such a big

1105
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,160
topic um and it never really got enough

1106
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,079
steam to to actually be adopted by the

1107
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,599
iab we talked about it once or twice i

1108
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:54,960
think

1109
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,160
but the the topic stayed with me and as

1110
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,760
we went on i thought i wanted to write

1111
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,079
more about it so here we are

1112
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,400
um and i i very much want to keep the

1113
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,240
focus here on exploring how

1114
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,160
centralization relates to the internet

1115
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,000
standards community and our work

1116
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
um there is a lot more that can be

1117
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,200
talked about here and i know that it's

1118
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,760
it's something we return to fairly often

1119
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,920
uh around competition and economic

1120
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,640
factors and and and so forth and so on

1121
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,640
but we we lack expertise and authority

1122
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,119
in those areas and and in in a lot of

1123
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,400
cases and one of the main points of the

1124
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,480
draft is is that you know while we see

1125
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,720
centralization happening we don't

1126
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,800
necessarily have the ability to prevent

1127
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,160
it with the tools that we have in our

1128
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,800
toolbox uh but but having said that

1129
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,640
there are still things we can do and so

1130
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,560
that's kind of the

1131
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,920
the area that the draft is trying to

1132
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,760
stake out and and and talk about

1133
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,800
um oh i see okay so this is the current

1134
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,839
table of contents um it starts by trying

1135
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,839
to define centralization with the

1136
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,040
american spelling uh it tries to uh talk

1137
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,880
about why it's not a great thing to have

1138
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,960
centralized internet protocols why we're

1139
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,760
trying to avoid it uh and and then it it

1140
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,599
offers a kind of a taxonomy of

1141
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,000
centralization of different kinds

1142
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,280
that that

1143
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,400
we've observed

1144
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,720
um this is

1145
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,079
as far as i'm aware original i haven't

1146
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,480
seen anyone else do this and and as i'll

1147
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,000
i think the next slide says i haven't

1148
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,920
gotten a lot of feedback on this uh

1149
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,760
which means either i got it great the

1150
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,680
first go or people haven't really looked

1151
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,240
at it i'm not sure which um so if folks

1152
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,359
have thoughts about that i'd love to

1153
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,800
hear it offline

1154
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,880
um then it talks about kind of you know

1155
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,800
there there are some

1156
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,359
common conceptions about how

1157
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:37,119
decentralization can be brought by

1158
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,839
using certain techniques uh and it talks

1159
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,400
through why they are not magic bullets

1160
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,040
that can be used to solve centralization

1161
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,520
issues uh and then and then it concludes

1162
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,839
with a discussion of what we in this

1163
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,520
community you know might think about

1164
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,559
doing

1165
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,359
and and and and like makes a couple of

1166
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,720
recommendations or at least explores a

1167
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,839
couple of areas where you know that can

1168
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,119
or suggestions of how to guide that

1169
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,200
discussion

1170
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,839
um so so far um

1171
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,760
all the interactions i've had

1172
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,599
uh a lot of them have been private but

1173
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,359
it seems like there's pretty strong and

1174
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,119
broad interest in the topic

1175
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,960
uh and i've had a fair amount of

1176
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,960
encouragement to pursue this work which

1177
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,720
has kept me revising it about once a

1178
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,559
month right now

1179
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:21,599
i've made a lot of tweaks and

1180
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,040
adjustments throughout based upon the

1181
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,559
feedback i've received

1182
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,040
uh and i i think as i mentioned i

1183
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,319
haven't had a lot of substantial

1184
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,280
suggestions on the kinds of

1185
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,880
centralization but a lot of the

1186
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,240
discussion has been around what should

1187
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,920
internet standards do and i think that

1188
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,640
needs some more development um and and i

1189
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,000
realized when i was putting these slides

1190
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,800
together i need to update the

1191
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,440
acknowledgement section as well

1192
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,760
so uh next steps

1193
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,200
my gut feeling is we're something like

1194
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,280
75 of the way there

1195
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,680
we could spend a lot of time working in

1196
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,200
this area generally but i'd like to ship

1197
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,480
something

1198
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,400
and so i have some open issues

1199
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
i i'm getting some feedback so i saw

1200
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,839
yara gave some feedback which was quite

1201
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,000
interesting just about an hour ago

1202
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,839
which i think i'm gonna enjoy talking

1203
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:02,800
through with him and incorporating the

1204
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,000
document

1205
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,160
right now my plan is to submit it to the

1206
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,920
independent stream and i've been talking

1207
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,000
to the ise about that a little bit

1208
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,079
um but i do wanna incorporate more

1209
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,160
review and feedback from the community

1210
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,559
uh and publish that relatively soon

1211
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,240
so um

1212
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,480
that's the the first url is is the the

1213
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,640
repo that i'm using to to develop this

1214
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,240
issues and discussion there is more than

1215
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,280
welcome

1216
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,760
um and so far uh the public discussions

1217
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,839
happened on architecture discuss if the

1218
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,599
ib is happy to continue that i'm happy

1219
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,760
to continue to use that or i can try and

1220
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,480
get another list if if the ib doesn't

1221
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,400
want me to do that um and that's all

1222
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,640
i've got

1223
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,160
yeah thanks mark for the update no i

1224
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,599
think this is definitely a good magic

1225
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,280
planning just to use

1226
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,079
um

1227
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,640
okay same thing we we take

1228
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,160
here's like one or two more slides and

1229
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,720
then we take the q so um you can unmute

1230
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,559
any time again mark or

1231
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,680
as soon as we have the questions yep

1232
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,920
and if you display my one slides there's

1233
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,079
only one actual slide and this will be

1234
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,520
brief so we have some time for

1235
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,880
discussion so

1236
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,960
very much in the same vein as uh mark

1237
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,240
was uh

1238
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,040
talking about uh now um so this is about

1239
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,119
the technical things that

1240
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,119
if you can go to the next slide um

1241
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,440
technical things that we could do about

1242
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,319
some aspects of centralization and

1243
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,599
i don't want to go into the details of

1244
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,200
this um

1245
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,480
but i wanted to highlight that there's

1246
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,480
like two categories that the

1247
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,680
iab or or groups around the iad have uh

1248
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,160
talked about in in recent times

1249
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,079
one is data and how that gets

1250
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,440
accumulated in smaller number of hands

1251
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,240
and what can we do about that and

1252
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,599
the other one is various kinds of

1253
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,880
linkages how how do you you know

1254
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,000
bundle os or device or browser and some

1255
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,240
application systems and service services

1256
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,640
together and how you find

1257
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,960
the different components and how how

1258
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,280
tight those bindings are and there are

1259
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,000
things you can do about this um just to

1260
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,240
list on the right side a few

1261
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,079
things that the itf has recently worked

1262
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,480
on so uh for

1263
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,599
data for instance obvious dns or pre vpn

1264
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,760
type of solutions are

1265
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,599
one approach of course we can also try

1266
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,559
and

1267
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,240
eliminate some of the data don't send as

1268
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,440
much data

1269
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,480
but

1270
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,800
um these are other tools as well and

1271
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,160
then for

1272
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,040
these

1273
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,960
two type bindings you have discovery

1274
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,720
that discovery and modularity that you

1275
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,319
can apply and uh ddr is one good example

1276
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,240
of that coming out of the add working

1277
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,079
group so i think that's it for now you

1278
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,640
can look at the slides in more detail um

1279
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,079
and uh we can go to the discussion

1280
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,400
thanks

1281
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,760
thank you

1282
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,880
um

1283
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,040
yeah i mean actually yari and mark and

1284
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,040
beat if you just want to stay there put

1285
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,960
your video on

1286
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,800
and we start the discussion we start the

1287
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,440
queue question

1288
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,960
thank you van i've been following your

1289
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,760
work for some time and it's it's great

1290
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,800
and uh i'd like to see that work

1291
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,040
published i mean

1292
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,359
i'd like to see that work even as much

1293
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,558
visibility as we can

1294
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,119
the um

1295
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,079
the the one thing i'd like to

1296
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,400
be clear about is

1297
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,200
whether we should measure cdn

1298
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,240
concentration by itself

1299
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,720
or as the

1300
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,720
part of the web delivery process

1301
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,319
when i do my

1302
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,160
own measurements which are not as

1303
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,319
extensive as yours

1304
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,119
i i do for example that if you look at

1305
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,839
the top

1306
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,760
sides one of the biggest provider of the

1307
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,079
top sides is wikipedia

1308
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,359
because wikipedia has

1309
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,599
an infrastructure that covers many

1310
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,480
countries etc etc and it's it becomes

1311
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,400
very visible

1312
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,000
now uh

1313
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,079
that kind of stuff i mean a big

1314
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,240
organization like wikipedia but the same

1315
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,640
is true for facebook or google or

1316
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,119
microsoft or many others

1317
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,599
is also a delivery mechanism which

1318
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,920
actually competes with the biocides

1319
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,200
with

1320
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,920
some kind of a closed market so

1321
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,280
i was wondering whether we should also

1322
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,880
assess

1323
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,960
the importance of stuff like that

1324
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,119
and

1325
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,680
so i i don't know if you want that so

1326
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,119
that was

1327
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,480
one question

1328
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,480
and the other question is that yes i

1329
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,319
mean we we have to

1330
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,960
to go into this publication assets also

1331
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,680
the the world of platforms we see the

1332
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,680
concentration happening in the

1333
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,000
underlying platforms i mean the

1334
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,680
the the

1335
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,720
place where the hosts are i mean being

1336
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,040
dns providers uh

1337
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,119
virtual network virtual machine

1338
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,800
providers etc

1339
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,640
that's also something i

1340
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,839
should

1341
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,240
publish

1342
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,440
yeah thank you christian i think that

1343
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,240
wasn't really a question right

1344
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,240
well now the question is basically how

1345
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,040
do we define these things okay like

1346
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,480
no it's not a question to answer it's an

1347
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,880
open question for the community okay

1348
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,240
yeah

1349
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,119
okay thank you then we take the next and

1350
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,440
the queue

1351
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,119
hi um and thanks for the presentations

1352
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,160
um prior to mark's uh draft mark

1353
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,880
mcfadden myself and um elliott has it

1354
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,599
have a draft it's still out there um

1355
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,240
revision three on centralization as well

1356
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,079
so i was thinking one way forward would

1357
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,359
be

1358
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,599
to have a reconciliation or have a look

1359
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,839
at our both of our drafts together and

1360
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,839
maybe see where each of us

1361
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,319
um can fill in the holes uh and that's

1362
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,760
just something to think about going

1363
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,960
forward i'll post the the link here um

1364
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,880
and also on the um

1365
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,359
also on the mailing list the other thing

1366
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,440
i just wanted to bring up um just more

1367
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,359
generally maybe perhaps following on

1368
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,440
from um yari's

1369
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,280
uh presentation is that uh steven in sag

1370
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,760
mentioned consolidation um around

1371
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,920
protocols that are going from two to

1372
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,319
three different protocols um and that's

1373
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,520
something that i don't think has been

1374
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,760
looked at yet uh in terms of

1375
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,319
standardization here at the ietf so it's

1376
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:35,920
just another thought for something we

1377
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,240
can put together on on all these drafts

1378
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,598
so thanks thanks a lot

1379
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,440
thank you

1380
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,920
elliot

1381
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,359
hi again um

1382
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:50,799
all right a couple of things now first

1383
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,400
of all i think my name has fallen off

1384
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,040
that draft dominique um i had hoped to

1385
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,760
actually contribute but for various

1386
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,240
reasons mostly involving the rfc update

1387
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,559
process and a few other things i ran out

1388
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,680
of time and steam at the time that that

1389
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,960
was going

1390
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,960
um

1391
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,040
the other point i just wanted to make is

1392
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,240
um really channeling colin here

1393
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,359
um in that there was a workshop

1394
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,119
last year

1395
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,440
uh in the dnrg

1396
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,480
uh this is the uh it was a workshop on

1397
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,799
centralization in the internet

1398
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,640
um i will post the link into the chat

1399
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,799
it's probably good for anybody who's

1400
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,760
interested in this topic take a look at

1401
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,680
the presentations there

1402
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,480
um

1403
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,480
and i'll just end with

1404
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,440
um

1405
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,200
while mark and i haven't indeed been

1406
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,920
talking um

1407
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,839
regardless of whether we decide to go

1408
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,440
forward in the independent stream if we

1409
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,040
do i'm certainly hoping that that

1410
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,799
wouldn't be the end of the conversation

1411
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,400
but more to spur additional conversation

1412
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,839
um both in the ietf and elsewhere

1413
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,480
this is a top

1414
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:08,079
tprc and weiss and and many other places

1415
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,920
where there are policy implications

1416
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,160
economics considerations

1417
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,280
this is something where i think we

1418
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,440
should reach across

1419
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,000
in order to form better shared

1420
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,799
understanding thank you

1421
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,079
well i i just wanted to

1422
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,680
suggest that the iab

1423
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,440
takes a look at what i think is one of

1424
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,200
the key issues that are open around this

1425
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,720
centralization thing there are many

1426
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,760
aspects

1427
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,599
but the one that i've seen coming up

1428
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,960
around and around

1429
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,040
in the end in different uh forms is the

1430
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,640
relationship between the applications

1431
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,400
and the network there's a draft also in

1432
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,240
the list not in these two ones but it

1433
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,839
was in the agenda before

1434
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,079
on exchanging signals between the two

1435
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,160
applications and the network and this is

1436
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,920
really the key point

1437
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,079
because in the end i mean in the last 10

1438
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,079
years we've seen this trend

1439
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,839
the test performance centralization by

1440
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,440
taking functionalities that were

1441
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,200
traditionally provided by

1442
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,680
the network by let's say

1443
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,440
thousands of isps globally if you look

1444
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,040
at the global space hundreds of

1445
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,640
thousands of corporates that are

1446
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,880
providing network access and 200

1447
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,400
different governments scattered around

1448
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,160
the world and now these functions are

1449
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,559
being centralized into the hands of four

1450
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,480
browser makers two mobile operating

1451
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,920
system makers

1452
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,440
and uh i mean

1453
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,280
in terms of messaging maybe three four

1454
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,520
five companies so

1455
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,440
globally this is really one of the the

1456
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,880
reasons why we're seeing this since i

1457
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,319
generally and we're getting more and

1458
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:38,559
more of it as soon as we continue moving

1459
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,559
functionalities from the network to the

1460
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,920
application level

1461
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,839
so there should be

1462
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,480
an itf position idf idea of in the end

1463
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,079
where do we see in the long term the

1464
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,760
relationship between the applications

1465
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,440
and the network to be

1466
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,400
if any data on connections and

1467
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,920
activities has to be shared from the

1468
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,240
applications with the network operator

1469
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,359
or not

1470
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,960
under which conditions and part of this

1471
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,559
will be a policy decision so there will

1472
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,240
be i'm sure there will be regulators

1473
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,079
involving these competition authorities

1474
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,599
there's so many other aspects which are

1475
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,920
not technical but at least if the fdf

1476
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,359
could come up with

1477
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,440
ways to do this communication when it's

1478
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,119
necessary when in the end it will be

1479
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,559
decided that it's necessary to share

1480
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,720
information and discussions on how to do

1481
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,720
it well rather than how to do it in a

1482
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,400
bad way i think this could be a

1483
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,240
contribution to advance the discussion

1484
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,240
thank you

1485
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,240
yeah as you said the the iab is working

1486
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,040
on a document here um i i see this

1487
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,960
mostly as a separate topic but as he

1488
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,119
also said there is a loose relation by

1489
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,280
by this trend to move up the stack and

1490
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,200
then having less players and there are

1491
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,440
pros and cons of that

1492
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,440
okay um

1493
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,160
php

1494
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,640
yes uh

1495
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,559
i

1496
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,480
centralization is the frame that we've

1497
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,000
received

1498
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
but that doesn't necessarily mean that

1499
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,400
that is the right frame through which we

1500
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,200
should be looking at this problem

1501
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,680
i don't worry about centralization

1502
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,960
itself

1503
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,599
i worry about walled gardens

1504
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,799
i worry about switching costs

1505
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,520
if i can switch from one vendor to

1506
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,640
another

1507
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,440
without having pain without having

1508
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,760
stickiness

1509
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,640
i don't care about the centralization

1510
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,160
so much

1511
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,760
if i can

1512
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,359
talk to somebody

1513
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,200
who is using a different messaging

1514
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,400
format i don't mind i don't worry so

1515
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,680
much

1516
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,799
um on the social media side

1517
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,200
i'm not that worried about the

1518
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,720
publication side of things and worried

1519
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,680
about the curation side of things

1520
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,280
because it is the curation power of

1521
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,480
facebook

1522
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,040
that was abused

1523
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,599
to set an agenda

1524
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,000
that promoted a particular set of

1525
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,160
politics

1526
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,400
and so i think that we've got to be

1527
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,960
rather skeptical of the frame that we're

1528
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,319
given

1529
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:09,760
and address the real frames

1530
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,280
and those are actually the ones that we

1531
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,000
can do something about we we don't do

1532
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,160
economics here but we do do

1533
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,599
interoperable

1534
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,960
we could

1535
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,359
make internet accounts portable so you

1536
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,599
could take your email account from one

1537
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,480
vendor to another

1538
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,720
and we could have a decentralized

1539
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,359
curation capability

1540
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,839
rss was originally designed for

1541
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:39,359
that yeah thank you i think this is very

1542
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,559
much the point of the discussion to

1543
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,799
figure out what we in this community

1544
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,240
could be doing

1545
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,400
and how we can move forward

1546
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,599
um

1547
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,119
we have carl in the queue who was

1548
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,599
supposed to uh present a few slides from

1549
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,559
isaac um but now he's here and so go

1550
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,799
ahead carl

1551
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,960
yes uh thank you very much and first of

1552
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,200
all apologies for for joining late i

1553
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,480
missed the time

1554
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,920
for jumping in

1555
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,079
but um i just wanted to flag that we've

1556
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,240
been uh working a little bit on this at

1557
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,240
the internet society for a few years

1558
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,079
thinking about consolidation and

1559
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,160
centralization and

1560
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,880
quite recently we launched

1561
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,119
a uh what we call a focus area kind of a

1562
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,060
thematic view

1563
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,359
[Music]

1564
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:24,319
on centralization on our pulse platform

1565
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,480
which is

1566
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,559
basically trying to curate information

1567
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,400
and data on different thematics and one

1568
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,200
of them being centralization

1569
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,079
uh and i won't go into much details uh

1570
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,520
about

1571
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,160
uh more about that background more than

1572
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,920
to say that

1573
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,160
what we're doing there in in the context

1574
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,839
of you know trying to break down this

1575
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,280
question of centralization what we're

1576
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,000
looking at specifically in that area is

1577
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,160
around market concentration

1578
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,000
for the provision of certain or specific

1579
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,240
technologies for for popular websites

1580
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,240
so we're collaborating with a partner

1581
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,359
called w3 tech that produces these web

1582
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,760
technology surveys basically querying a

1583
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,160
website looking at for a given set of

1584
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,839
technologies who are the providers

1585
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:10,960
involved

1586
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,000
and then we calculate a market share

1587
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,680
on that basis so the market share in

1588
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,000
this context is understood as the

1589
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,319
ratio of sites using a provider to all

1590
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,480
sites using that technology

1591
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,240
and that is a bit of a mouthful but

1592
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,079
effectively means if you have a sample

1593
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,960
in which 20 of the websites uses say

1594
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,480
cloudflare then cloudflare is given a 20

1595
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,000
market share

1596
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,400
and then we use those market shares to

1597
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,119
to calculate concentration metrics uh

1598
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,319
two of them

1599
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,000
one of them being the gini coefficient

1600
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,520
that you might be familiar with from

1601
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,160
other contexts like income inequality

1602
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,640
and one of them being hhi

1603
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,920
but the idea here is that we're

1604
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,200
interested

1605
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,000
in

1606
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,440
trying to come up with concentration

1607
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,559
measures

1608
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,240
for these different services and

1609
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,000
importantly kind of see where the trend

1610
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,599
is heading in what direction are we

1611
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,200
going

1612
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,440
so we launched this in december and is

1613
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,440
very much looking for feedback

1614
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,520
we received some very useful feedback

1615
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,480
from

1616
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,720
many people in the itf community already

1617
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,480
that we've incorporated

1618
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,799
but we're definitely looking for more so

1619
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,119
i encourage everyone to have a look at

1620
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,640
that

1621
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,960
that website scrutinize what we're doing

1622
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,839
and we very much welcome feedback to the

1623
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,680
pulse at iso.org address thank you

1624
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,359
yeah thanks carl um

1625
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:31,520
glad that you made it i think this is a

1626
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,200
very valuable input to the discussion

1627
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,640
and i think all what we heard today is

1628
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,240
just like the start of discussion we

1629
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,799
need to have and we should have um so

1630
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,480
please go to the architecture discuss

1631
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,359
mailing list or contact the ib directly

1632
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,319
uh we are at time but um mark and yet as

1633

you're still here if you want to add

1634
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,160
something or say something we have a few

1635
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,558
seconds
