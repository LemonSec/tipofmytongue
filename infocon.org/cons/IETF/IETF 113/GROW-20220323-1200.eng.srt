a warm welcome to all of you it is very

11
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,519
nice to be here

12
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,599
face to face in part

13
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,440
and a warm welcome to our remote

14
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,159
attendees from all over the world

15
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,680
luckily for us we are anchored in the

16
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,480
european time zone native to my home

17
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,159
but i very much appreciate all the

18
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,560
people that are going bad

19
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,159
back to bed

20
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,560
or got up really early to attend this

21
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,840
session

22
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,640
um let's go through the

23
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,200
administrative

24
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,640
administrative that's a difficult word

25
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,720
administrative side of things

26
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,799
first of all this session is covered by

27
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,200
the ietf notewell

28
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,519
this means that we adhere to a certain

29
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,080
code of conduct specifically

30
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,840
in relation to civility

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,680
different than other meetings there are

32
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
no blue sheets to go around i dearly

33
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
miss the tradition but if you scan the

34
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
qr code that was here at the beginning

35
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,799
of the session

36
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,920
or go to the agenda on your phone

37
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,120
there's the meet echo lite

38
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
application and that's how you check in

39
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
and also how you cue yourself up for the

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,720
microphone

41
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,639
since this is the third day of itf i

42
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,560
assume that all the people in the room

43
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,839
are somewhat familiar with that

44
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,320
procedure

45
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
and meet echo thank you very much for

46
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
your assistance and help

47
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
specific to the grow working group there

48
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,479
are a number of resources

49
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,400
most importantly

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,639
our agenda can be viewed online and we

51
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,360
have a mailing list

52
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,240
i would now like to ask for a minutes

53
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
taker

54
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
jared would you like to be volunteered

55
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,159
for this job

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
good enough for me thank you for your

57
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,759
services jared

58
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,840
if anybody can also keep an eye on the

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,039
meat echo chat which is what previously

60
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,320
was known as the jabber thing

61
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,639
to ensure that we catch any and all

62
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,720
comments and questions

63
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,759
that

64
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,039
arrive from that communication channel

65
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,120
we have a volunteer for

66
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
jabber scribing

67
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,840
thank you warren your services are much

68
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,280
appreciated but in order to

69
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
fulfill this task you will need to open

70
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,240
your laptop

71
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,560
all right

72
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,639
agenda

73
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,199
today we have

74
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,880
a few topics

75
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,400
specifically bmp nrtm

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
mbmp you can see that we mix them up a

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,479
little bit to create an interesting

78
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,000
variance in our cadence today

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,450
our presenters are remote

80
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,919
[Music]

81
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,440
and i think unless you have anything to

82
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,680
add chris we we can move

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
to to the first presentation

84
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,840
yes

85
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,159
please all right

86
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,759
we're not there yet

87
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,240
follow

88
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
you

89
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,360
hello

90
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,080
hello paulo good to see you

91
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,960
yes great great and thank you for

92
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,680
awarding you know 12 minutes uh of the

93
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,720
agenda not 10 not 15. that was a greatly

94
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
appreciated it's precisely what i was

95
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,840
looking for

96
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,960
um

97
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,759
so

98
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,120
um i have uh updates on two uh drafts so

99
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,280
the tlv and the ebit tlp ebit draft so

100
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
next slide if some somebody is running

101
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
the slides

102
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,479
yes if you give me the signal i will

103
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,479
make it go to the next slide

104
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,520
next slide please

105
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,319
and next one again

106
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,039
perfect so i skipped the context because

107
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,680
every time i present the this draft i

108
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
give the top context so it's in the

109
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,039
previous slide for who has lost the

110
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,960
context for this one

111
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,680
um so just a brief update on what

112
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,400
happened since uh the last dra the last

113
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
version of the document so which is last

114
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
itf um

115
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
essentially we formalized a little bit

116
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,759
the boolean story coming from you know

117
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,599
programming background i was thinking

118
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,759
that just saying boolean was clear

119
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,960
enough but i received that the feedback

120
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,840
that

121
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,319
uh we should specify it's a one byte

122
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,680
field with

123
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,759
you know zero and one that can be

124
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,400
encoded in there so thanks very much to

125
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,199
jeff and bang for their feedback about

126
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,080
that

127
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,520
uh following uh the the rest of the

128
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,080
recommendation here uh they they were

129
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
all coming from jeff haas

130
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,479
and um so we should ask uh ayanna for

131
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,800
two new registries one for the root

132
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
monitoring a message and the other for

133
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,679
the peer down and then we added also an

134
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,880
error handling section um so in which

135
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,320
essentially what we say that um the tlvs

136
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,559
are trailing you know are following the

137
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,360
bgp video and of course you can decode

138
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
the tlds only if the bgp pdu is well

139
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
formed if you cannot pass that then of

140
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
course you cannot go beyond that and so

141
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,839
you cannot parse the tlds

142
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
uh so uh side remark is that uh you know

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,160
if you want to do an exercise which is

144
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,839
different from uh you know

145
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,560
conveying the messages but uh

146
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,279
you want to check the sanity of the pdu

147
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,120
and things like that maybe you are

148
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,880
looking for the root

149
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,839
mirroring instead of the root monitoring

150
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,720
um

151
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
and the second thing the secondary

152
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
market that was also coming from jeff

153
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,519
was that

154
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,839
as we know you know the message size is

155
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,160
limited and then uh

156
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,120
this is already you know a problem with

157
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,399
the bgp pdu itself and with bmp by

158
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,080
itself because there is a decoration

159
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,120
around the bgp pdu uh should it hit you

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,839
know itself the maximum length and then

161
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,560
of course this is aggravated with the

162
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
the use of tlts so it was good to make a

163
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,959
note over there

164
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,839
next slide please

165
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,800
and so

166
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,480
this is the status

167
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,200
for the version 7 of the draft and

168
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,360
essentially all the feedback that was

169
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,480
received has been processed and there is

170
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,680
really no more outstanding work

171
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,360
so this is a message for the chairs uh

172
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
and also i don't know if there is any

173
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
questions or any

174
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,839
any anything from anybody at this point

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,880
i have a question

176
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,279
if there's no more outstanding work

177
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,600
is there running code that you can

178
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
report on implementation reports

179
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,399
yes

180
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
yes this is all coded on the collector

181
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
siding pmsct it is coded it is working

182
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,560
it was test

183
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
um there is at least one vendor that i

184
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
am aware that has you know such

185
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
implementation so

186
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,800
yeah

187
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,600
so i guess you're asking for working

188
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,519
group last call and the sausage

189
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,959
machinery to

190
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,040
start running yeah

191
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,920
i think we are already in last call

192
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,480
i think i want to go beyond the last

193
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
call

194
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,600
all right

195
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,320
all right fantastic so next slide please

196
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,920
uh so this is about the uh tlv ebit uh

197
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,399
so this is the last present the last

198
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
time i presented this was at uh in

199
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,760
singapore in 2019 the last time that we

200
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,240
were i i was in person

201
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,200
um

202
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,440
and i think this is a very useful draft

203
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,079
but uh uh you know uh

204
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,200
we received even in the room some uh you

205
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,560
know

206
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,200
interesting comments about it so i've i

207
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,279
thought to refresh a little bit give

208
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,240
context again and share updates

209
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
so next slide please

210
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,040
um so what is the

211
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,839
problem statement here is that of course

212
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,040
uh you know uh we have uh tlds that we

213
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,600
explained in the other draft and till

214
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,399
these are public our ayanna governed and

215
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,040
you know we asked ayanna for registries

216
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,279
and then you know um every you know id

217
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,399
in that registry will mean something um

218
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,800
that is something for those registries

219
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,680
governed by ayana are of course for um

220
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,959
you know

221
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
elements that should be supported by you

222
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,399
know everybody or generally supported of

223
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,800
course next to that there could be some

224
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,040
elements that are not that are

225
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,240
proprietary that are you know not public

226
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,480
uh why is that there is a wealth of

227
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,440
reasons for that so the one of the most

228
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,920
common is that it's a you know a

229
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,120
pre-standard product right um another

230
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
one is that there is a

231
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
something that is commercially sensitive

232
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,680
but yet another point and this is

233
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,079
something on which i will update uh the

234
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,800
introduction of the of the draft is also

235
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,959
that there could be elements that are

236
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,519
very low level so they cannot really be

237
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,600
standardized right they could be low

238
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,920
level or really touching the internal of

239
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,200
the implementation that maybe it doesn't

240
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,519
generally exist or make sense to make

241
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,839
something you know ayanna go there so

242
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,920
this is this specific point which is

243
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,320
very relevant it's not yet mentioned in

244
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,800
the draft and i will do in the next you

245
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,760
know

246
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
release let's say

247
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,480
and next slide please

248
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,480
so um

249
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,200
as an introduction just in case uh not

250
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,000
everybody's familiar with the uh pang

251
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,120
pang is a private enterprise number and

252
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,160
it's a number that is assigned by ayana

253
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,040
so

254
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,519
whoever can go to a young and say i am

255
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,480
an enterprise and a young hands off

256
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,519
you know um an id i i don't know if it's

257
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,839
whoever but for example even

258
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,120
pmcct as a pen number okay

259
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,279
so the pen is the key in order to

260
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,320
make the enterprise specific part to

261
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,800
work and this is all you know nothing

262
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
new under the sun uh you know who knows

263
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,560
me i know i come from a lot of

264
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,440
experience with ipfix working with ipfix

265
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
and things like that and i just borrowed

266
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
something that i think it's very useful

267
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,920
and it totally works for ipfix but you

268
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,279
know porting that to bmp

269
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,720
next slide please

270
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
so

271
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,720
this is how ayanna gover and the tlv uh

272
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,040
is looking like you know um so

273
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,120
essentially we strip the first bit of

274
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,160
the type for that e and that becomes the

275
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,480
e b to the enterprise bit which could be

276
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,279
zero or one so in a young gober in the

277
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,320
tlv the e bit is zero and then

278
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,199
everything just stays as the other draft

279
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,160
the tlv draft that i just presented then

280
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,120
next slide please

281
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
in case

282
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
instead it is an enterprise specific one

283
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,199
the ebit goes to one and you see that

284
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,079
after the length you have the enterprise

285
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,000
number the enterprise number will be the

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,639
pan that i was describing before so you

287
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,360
have type land the enterprise number and

288
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
then the value

289
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,680
next slide please

290
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,720
so

291
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,600
what is you know the status right so um

292
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,480
there was uh you know some feedback that

293
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,920
was processed uh or actually all the

294
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,519
outstanding feedback was uh processed um

295
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,160
so an operational considerations action

296
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,880
was added again on on under suggestion

297
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,639
of jeff jeff has

298
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,800
um and essentially he was recommending

299
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,000
that you know uh whoever is endorsing

300
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,959
this uh scheme essentially should um you

301
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,199
know make publicly available their

302
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,920
privately defined registries

303
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,800
and uh and there were a number of

304
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,120
editorial comments and things like that

305
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,360
there are open questions like what could

306
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,079
be the scope of ebit right so for so far

307
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,880
the scope is just the tlds but uh of

308
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,279
course the you know you can make private

309
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
messages you can make private stats

310
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,079
types and things like that i mean we can

311
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,959
be you know more ambitious than this but

312
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,120
i would say that first of all and that's

313
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,240
the next question whether this is a work

314
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
that is relevant for the working group

315
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,720
and whether um

316
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,399
you know uh it would be accepted and the

317
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,279
last time just for an extra context and

318
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,399
with that i'm done uh let's say when i

319
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,959
asked this question there were

320
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,360
a little bit of mixed feeling and then i

321
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,560
wanted to see whether uh

322
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
also with that remark that i was making

323
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,000
before about that ebit is also about you

324
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,680
know things that cannot really be

325
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,320
standardized because maybe they are not

326
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,959
really their internal

327
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,119
internal bits are very low level and

328
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,839
maybe do not apply to the wider you know

329
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,640
public the well doesn't make sense to

330
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,760
make a young a good point for that uh

331
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,520
whether that changes anything right

332
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,319
are there any questions from

333
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,640
participants or the room

334
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
i see ben

335
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
virtually wants to get in the queue and

336
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,440
is now physically moving towards a

337
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,000
microphone

338
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,039
uh

339
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,440
ben madison work online hi paulo

340
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,960
um

341
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,280
so i think this is a generally good idea

342
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,720
um

343
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,120
and i think that given the overlap from

344
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,640
an implementation perspective that's

345
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,679
likely to exist between bmp and ipfix i

346
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,840
think kind of stealing the the mechanism

347
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,520
is also a good idea

348
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,400
um

349
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,760
question on

350
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,640
uh could you go back to the uh

351
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,120
the packet format slide

352
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
um

353
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
uh the the one for the enterprise

354
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,879
variant the next one

355
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,159
is it coming

356
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,799
i see

357
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,080
so the

358
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,640
the the private enterprise number field

359
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,360
is that is the idea that that contains

360
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,760
only the private enterprise number or

361
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,600
would that be the private that would

362
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,720
that be some locally significant value

363
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
qualified by the private enterprise

364
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,280
number

365
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,919
because not that

366
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,440
no that's that would be just the

367
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,640
enterprise number so depend the public

368
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,120
you know the private private enterprise

369
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,080
number but the type would be the you

370
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,039
know

371
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,720
locally

372
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,000
okay okay i see so the the the the

373
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,039
enterprise number acts as a namespace

374
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,679
scope for the type of field exactly

375
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,280
exactly okay that makes that make sense

376
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,120
that makes sense yes um

377
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,960
so my only my only concern here um

378
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,160
is that this ends up being a way for

379
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,120
vendors to all implement essentially the

380
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,320
same thing

381
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,600
but with their own special name and

382
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,320
syntax and you know various different

383
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
ways in which you have to write the same

384
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,240
code 100 times in order to operate a

385
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,280
multi-vendor network

386
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,039
i think that

387
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,400
i think maybe a slightly stronger

388
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,160
recommendation about making a registry

389
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
available

390
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,200
possibly in some sort of minimally

391
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,120
machine readable format

392
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,320
might go some way to help alleviate that

393
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,280
but i think you know a a fairly strong

394
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,919
recommendation that this should not be

395
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,120
used other than for you know temporarily

396
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
for things that

397
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,760
are likely

398
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,600
even in the distant future to be

399
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,360
standardized would be helpful because we

400
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,720
don't want

401
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,679
you know

402
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,440
a situation where

403
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,679
every vendor in the whole world has got

404
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,640
a separate type for

405
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,440
asparth for example do you know

406
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
yeah yeah absolutely absolutely and you

407
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,799
see this is very along

408
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,880
the lines of the feedback that was

409
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
provided also

410
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,919
um

411
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,720
in singapore in 2019 and that time who

412
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
was uh saying that was actually it was

413
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,400
job it was job right our very and true

414
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,200
job

415
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,960
um and the the my answer back then and

416
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,280
that's uh you know the only thing that i

417
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,159
can answer today is that so first of all

418
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,640
is that yeah we should put in there all

419
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,200
the text possible right

420
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
uh we should make this happen because

421
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,120
it's useful and put in there all the

422
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
text possible in terms of recommendation

423
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,039
and things like that the second thing is

424
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,600
that we can look at the story of iphix

425
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
because fortunately since we are not

426
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,159
inventing anything we can

427
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,320
look at the past and see how that worked

428
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,960
well or not with ipfix and in latifix we

429
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,000
don't see

430
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,799
that happening that they all have the

431
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,400
very same thing

432
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,159
but um

433
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,559
not standardized you see uh there are

434
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,880
things that are certainly remaining

435
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,159
permanent right so uh for example then

436
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,919
not the whole career grid not uh logging

437
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,720
for example it's something it that is

438
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,520
staying into private elements and things

439
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
like that but uh

440
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,400
that is probably because there is one

441
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,960
vendor only implementing that or two

442
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,960
vendors only you see so i from the story

443
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,000
of ipfix i feel to be positive that this

444
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,159
mechanism is not abused of course i

445
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,679
don't have the oracle so i don't know

446
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,000
what's going to happen

447
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,039
um and i'm totally willing to do our

448
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,360
part as itf and put in there the whole

449
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,080
world that we should be putting in order

450
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,000
to discourage to

451
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,159
abuse this mechanism

452
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,520
yeah that makes sense

453
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,760
thanks

454
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,880
jeff

455
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,480
uh so

456
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,960
backing up ed's comments uh i pasted a

457
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
presentation that i had given the prior

458
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,120
ietf and codepoint management

459
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,799
the the challenge that you usually end

460
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,480
up seeing for this stuff is that uh

461
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,400
it's usually back pressure that you get

462
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,039
from the registry availability so like

463
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,640
the majority of uh

464
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,799
you know bmp's spaces were originally

465
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,760
done under very tight uh requirements uh

466
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,400
the current one is under a specification

467
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,760
required which is

468
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,679
not quite as loose as first come first

469
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,799
serve

470
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,600
and

471
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,520
what we're looking for for

472
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,200
stuff that you'd want to put into

473
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,640
non-enterprise space is

474
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,960
if this is generally useful

475
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,880
make it as easy as possible for people

476
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,360
to be able to publish a specification

477
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,000
and get a code point and just ship their

478
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
feature

479
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,039
and you know that said

480
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,559
part of the back pressure that you get

481
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,159
is you know what if you're not sure that

482
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,360
it knows something that's generally

483
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
useful

484
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,559
giving the vendors a playground to be

485
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,000
able to do stuff

486
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,360
is a useful thing

487
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,440
uh one of the sort of dangers that's

488
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,159
discussed in the slides is that when you

489
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,760
do these sorts of things

490
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,440
there's always the concern that you know

491
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,039
how stable is the vendor going to make

492
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,120
something if it's their magic number

493
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
maybe they're less concerned about

494
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,120
stability than ietf might be and we see

495
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,799
this for incremental deployment of pgp

496
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
features is the example that we give in

497
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,080
the slides

498
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,520
so

499
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
the enterprise number isn't bad

500
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,240
uh there is a motivation in the bmp

501
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
community that if it's generally useful

502
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,440
feature we should be pushing people to

503
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,559
push put the stuff into public spaces

504
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,400
and we're very likely end up seeing that

505
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,840
uh they're could be transitional

506
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,760
scenarios where stuff may show up in an

507
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
enterprise field and they stay there

508
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,600
while also manifesting in the more

509
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
public versions because long term the

510
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,679
goals people's collectors will want to

511
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,440
gather the information from a common set

512
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,799
of code points and not have to worry

513
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,799
about well where do i get did you say as

514
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,039
path you know for this particular thing

515
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,480
thank you

516
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,799
thank you

517
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,440
benoit briefly was in the queue but

518
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,960
somehow disappeared so uh

519
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,820
read his comment out loud he indicates

520
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,120
[Music]

521
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
we did not see

522
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,000
concerns in the ipfix ie history

523
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,360
hopefully

524
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
so i guess that is a positive sign

525
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,240
towards using pen numbers in context of

526
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,720
vmp

527
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,279
so let me redo it right i want to make

528
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,200
it short but okay let me go to the mic

529
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,080
now so uh benoit class so yes in the

530
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,640
history of ipfix we had the same concern

531
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,520
initially and we have not seen that most

532
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,760
of the people were actually eager to

533
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,559
come

534
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,760
and propose them to ayana

535
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,080
as uh as in high peak information

536
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,360
elements the only one that were not done

537
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,919
in ayanna there were particular reasons

538
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,279
like it was

539
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,279
we would know we could not get consensus

540
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,520
across the industry but these are these

541
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,279
are really corner cases

542
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,440
so it was a concern for us initially and

543
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,880
in the end it was not

544
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,360
thank you

545
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,199
jeff you're still in the queue is

546
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,400
the queue cleared up

547
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,360
um

548
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,440
so the two items paulo

549
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,200
the ebitd thing you said it's in working

550
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,799
group classical and the chairs need to

551
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,919
do work

552
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,600
and for the

553
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,639
the tld not the e-beat

554
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,159
in this presentation you mentioned two

555
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,279
drafts right yes the first one yeah

556
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,600
the first one needs to

557
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,919
complete the working group last call

558
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,960
exactly the second one you propose to

559
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,679
request working group adoption

560
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,039
exactly

561
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,400
all right we will do those action items

562
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,760
thank you very much thank you very much

563
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,440
for your time

564
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,600
thank you paulo

565
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,400
um

566
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,840
next up

567
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,000
is sasha romain

568
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,039
i think i should actually ask you how to

569
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,760
pronounce it in english

570
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,679
i i don't even know how to pronounce it

571
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,159
in english

572
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,600
in that romaine

573
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,520
uh sasha please indicate when you want

574
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,639
me to move to the next slide

575
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,960
and the floor is yours welcome

576
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,000
thank you

577
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,159
my first itf meeting actually

578
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,919
so yeah my name is sasha romain i'm

579
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,799
presenting the draft on the near real

580
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,919
real-time

581
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,480
mirroring protocol version 4

582
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,400
co-authored with job schneiders at

583
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,080
strain and staffers constantires

584
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,559
next slide please

585
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,360
so a little bit of context first uh

586
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,080
energy mp4 is a protocol for ir

587
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,720
mirroring uh as many of you may be aware

588
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,880
but maybe not all the internet routing

589
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
registry actually consists of about a

590
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,799
dozen sort of

591
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,720
authoritative registries they have

592
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,000
different

593
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,760
operators different purposes different

594
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
scopes

595
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,320
and mirroring exists for these different

596
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,840
uh

597
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,640
registries to be able to mirror data

598
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,760
from each other it's a one-way process

599
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,720
so

600
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,120
for example if someone queries entity

601
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,799
comes

602
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,760
ir server they also see data that has

603
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
been mirrored from right and

604
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,120
things like that and also a number of uh

605
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,919
operators run their own local mirrors uh

606
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,520
they don't have authority but they run

607
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,039
their own mirrors for performance

608
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,360
analysis things like that

609
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,960
there are

610
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,760
a few common implementations for for ir

611
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,600
servers there's a few versions of the

612
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,760
right database software out there which

613
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,799
runs uh the registries from rypn c and

614
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,360
ethernet and apnic

615
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,880
there is a legacy version of iard

616
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,960
version 2 and 3 that's currently run by

617
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,440
rdb level 3 ltb few other smaller ones

618
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
and there is the

619
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,399
latest ird version 4 which is actively

620
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,440
developed still by me and runs

621
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,399
most of the other larger registries

622
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,199
next slide please

623
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,039
so currently this mirroring is done with

624
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,960
nrtm version 3 and mostly ftp downloads

625
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,000
this is a very poorly specified protocol

626
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,399
uh there's pdf somewhere it's plain text

627
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,880
overall tcp so that's there's no way to

628
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,480
check any kind of integrity or

629
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,919
authenticity

630
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,080
it skills very poorly essentially

631
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,039
there's

632
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,640
it's very difficult to skill at all

633
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,039
there is no status signaling so if you

634
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,120
query a server for

635
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,159
new

636
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,200
changes there is no automated way to for

637
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,399
it to tell you

638
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,559
you don't have access or i don't know

639
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,399
what you're asking or

640
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,320
everything is fine i just don't have any

641
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,000
new data so

642
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,240
there's no way to detect when it breaks

643
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,200
there's also the streaming of new

644
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,679
changes and the ftp downloads that you

645
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,080
initialize with are completely unlinked

646
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,679
basically and you sort of have to hope

647
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,000
that you got the right tool matched up

648
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,440
because there are

649
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,600
many fascinating ways in which nrtm

650
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,279
version 3

651
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,480
can break quietly weirdly

652
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,559
it's actually a major source of support

653
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,080
i give to users of ird version 4.

654
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,559
next slide please

655
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,240
so the new

656
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
draft

657
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,279
is

658
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,080
publishing nrtm data publishing the ir

659
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,960
mirroring data on a https endpoint

660
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,200
which

661
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,279
uh creates all the benefits that we have

662
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,520
with with publishing things on hbs which

663
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,159
is a thing we know very well to do

664
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:14,960
uh

665
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
it is inspired by irdb so there are some

666
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,240
similar concepts and names in here

667
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,320
there is a small update notification

668
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
file which functions as a

669
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,120
often retrieved index and points to a

670
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,480
snapshot

671
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,880
some deltas usually with changes in them

672
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,480
and the snapshots are periodic they

673
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,399
contain all the records at that time in

674
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,159
the ir database

675
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,679
they are large

676
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,559
and small deltas only contain

677
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,039
changes they are bashed into one minutes

678
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,720
time frames if there were any changes

679
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,120
and all these files are json-based

680
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,919
they'll support utf-8 currently in

681
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,240
energy mp3 and ftp there's no standard

682
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,640
on encoding so all the mirroring is full

683
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,760
of encoding glitches everywhere

684
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,840
the snapshots and deltas themselves are

685
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,159
immutable and they are cacheable

686
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:06,960
so

687
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,080
that helps with scaling them

688
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
and the update notification file itself

689
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,519
is signed the end contains hashes of all

690
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,200
the referred files so this allows

691
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,720
integrity checking

692
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,480
a bit more on that later because there's

693
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,640
still some open ends but the idea is to

694
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,120
offer integrity checking which we are

695
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,919
currently missing

696
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,360
and finally

697
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
there's a random session id which has to

698
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,480
match otherwise clients re-initialize

699
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,360
and this basically allows

700
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,159
mirror servers to

701
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,080
force clients to re-initialize which

702
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,000
there's currently no way for so somehow

703
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
there are gaps in history clients

704
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,279
silently and

705
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,039
without possibility of detection or

706
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,600
recovery run out of sync and

707
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,960
yeah it's uh

708
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,399
it's bad

709
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,879
next slide please

710
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,720
so for br servers the process is

711
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,480
basically going to be they generate new

712
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,039
session ids i'm obviously skipping over

713
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,840
a lot of uh details here but this is the

714
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,279
broad overview they generate a new

715
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,519
session id generator for snapshot which

716
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,000
sometimes may be empty not typically

717
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,240
a new update notification file publish

718
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,320
that on an endpoint

719
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,919
and then you're running nrtm version 4.

720
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,880
i should note that this is everything in

721
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,919
the protocol is per ir database so ripen

722
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,720
c who publishes ripe and write non-auth

723
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,760
these are totally separate in for nrtm

724
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,840
version 4.

725
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,559
next slide please

726
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,919
for updates uh every minute

727
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,320
where each mirror server will generate

728
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,880
a delta file if there are any changes if

729
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,399
they were a little late if they had

730
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,039
downtime they can catch up but generally

731
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,799
every minute if there were changes and

732
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,720
they are all sequentially numbered so

733
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,640
you can always know that you have a

734
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,799
consistent complete set of delta files

735
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,840
without

736
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,519
gaps

737
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,279
they then generate and sign a new update

738
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,880
notification file

739
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,360
also periodically there's new snapshot

740
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,720
files so that new clients who show up

741
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,960
they need to start with a snapshot file

742
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,919
so that shouldn't be too old

743
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,559
it's not necessarily every change so we

744
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,320
don't generate snapshots every minute

745
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,480
they're too large for that

746
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,600
but the idea is that clients don't start

747
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,039
off too far behind

748
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,360
there's also a regeneration of the

749
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,200
update notification file

750
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,120
even if it hasn't changed which allows

751
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,760
detection of still repositories some iar

752
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,279
databases are

753
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,080
incredibly quiet they have one chains

754
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,000
every few weeks maybe

755
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,960
so this allows to attack like is an ir

756
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,880
server still publishing to this endpoint

757
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,640
or or not

758
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,399
and an important distinction to note

759
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,960
with compared to energy and version 3 is

760
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,640
that we don't

761
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,559
none of the data that is transferred

762
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,799
between servers and clients is different

763
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,559
for clients the mirror server publishes

764
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,560
one set of changes that contains

765
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,879
everything any client needs

766
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,759
next slide please

767
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,719
mirror clients they retrieve the updates

768
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,879
notification file and signature they

769
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,839
verify it if there's data there and the

770
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,079
session id matches uh it's the same

771
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,320
version you're up to date you know and

772
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,918
you don't have to do anything

773
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,879
otherwise the client tries to pull in

774
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,320
the deltas to get to the latest version

775
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,918
if those are

776
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,760
not all present

777
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,079
because probably the client is has run

778
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,399
too far behind

779
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,918
or if the session id has become

780
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,520
different the client will always

781
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,960
reinactivize from the snapshot

782
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,440
automatically retrieve that verify

783
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,918
process it then continue following along

784
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,079
with the deltas again so if clients run

785
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,480
out of sync if there's a new publication

786
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,640
points clients always automatically

787
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,760
recover

788
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,290
next slide please

789
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:05,520
[Music]

790
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,520
um i won't go through all the fields of

791
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,000
the file in detail that's all in the

792
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,480
draft but this the update notification

793
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,560
file

794
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,920
which

795
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,599
as you can see essentially lists the

796
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,920
current snapshot and the version of that

797
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,160
along with all deltas the the

798
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,480
ir database that this is for and a

799
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,880
timestamp of publication to detect

800
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,960
stillness

801
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,760
next slide please

802
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,079
the snapshot file itself is a

803
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,400
fairly simple contains also session id

804
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,480
version source name so that we know

805
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,560
those are consistent and essentially a

806
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,599
list of objects uh nrtm version 4

807
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,400
intentionally does not go into the

808
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,640
actual syntax of

809
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,560
ir objects

810
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,800
basically because we don't have a

811
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,160
singular syntax of ir objects

812
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,640
so uh yeah that's why they are they're

813
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,680
presented as encoded strings

814
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,839
next slide please

815
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,480
and so finally the delta files are

816
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,880
are similar they list changes so one

817
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,119
delta file can have at least one

818
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,520
possibly many different changes of

819
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,960
deletions

820
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,359
additions modifications to

821
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,119
objects

822
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,839
next slide

823
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,520
of course any point of the draft is open

824
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,280
to discussion but i wanted to highlight

825
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,440
two particular ones

826
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,359
the first is the database configuration

827
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,320
file

828
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
as i mentioned the update notification

829
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
file is signed and it then contains

830
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,440
hashes of snapshots and the idea here is

831
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,240
that

832
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,880
we provide end-to-end integrity checking

833
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,520
so the ir server that published it all

834
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,920
the way to the ir server that is

835
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,320
processing this there's also hps which

836
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,400
offers transport security for part of

837
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,599
this

838
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,079
but not all of it

839
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,079
the problem of course then becomes how

840
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,640
does a client know which public key to

841
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,960
trust and how do we deal with key

842
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,880
rotation for example

843
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,200
because people will want to rotate their

844
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,520
keys

845
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,000
clients mirror clients don't really sign

846
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,240
up there's not really a single way to

847
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,640
effectively reach them

848
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,599
and so this is uh

849
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,800
we have

850
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,880
a plan for this now in the draft but

851
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,119
this is definitely the most open to

852
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,160
discussion next slide please

853
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,000
so the current approach we've chosen is

854
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
to have an additional file the database

855
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,320
configuration file

856
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,880
which contains ir database name like

857
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,599
write private non-public signing key of

858
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,720
the

859
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,000
updates notification file and the url

860
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,839
where those files should be expected and

861
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,359
this file is different from all the

862
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,079
others in that it must be published on a

863
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,599
well-known uri

864
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,000
on what i've called the generally known

865
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,040
authoritative domain

866
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,560
so other files can be published wherever

867
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,880
the operator wants to this one has to be

868
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,720
published on

869
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,960
this particular domain it's also low

870
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,480
traffic

871
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,520
and the idea here is that

872
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,920
if i would say

873
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,720
radb then everyone who is familiar with

874
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,560
the ir system

875
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,480
would agree on the same domain name that

876
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,560
we would all trust to say

877
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,079
where do we

878
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,599
retrieve the update notification file

879
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,480
where do we retrieve nrtm version 3 uh

880
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,960
where is the ftp server

881
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,200
and so to use that as a basis of trust

882
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,119
and allow configuration from there

883
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,960
this is

884
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,599
yeah so this is our approach so far

885
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,520
uh next slide please i only have two

886
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,720
more slides so question maybe at the end

887
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,599
uh another problem is delta expiration

888
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,240
uh because many of our clients will very

889
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,400
closely follow all the deltas that are

890
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,720
being published they retrieved snapshots

891
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,359
the update notification file frequently

892
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,119
download any new deltas they're going to

893
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,280
download a handful at a time

894
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,920
and these are also the ones that we want

895
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
to have low latency

896
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,560
so that's why we make them every minute

897
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,800
some clients though are going to lag

898
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,640
behind they're going to be down for a

899
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,880
while connectivity issues anything can

900
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,760
happen

901
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,320
and sometimes they are days weeks

902
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,560
potentially even months behind and

903
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,640
they're going to start up

904
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,480
um

905
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,520
and

906
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,040
with one minute

907
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,640
one delta every minute potentially there

908
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,079
are up to 1440 deltas okay

909
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,160
but for many databases i run some

910
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,760
numbers it's much less more in the order

911
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,240
of hundreds but still significant

912
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,040
next slide please

913
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,839
uh and so the initial idea was uh trim

914
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,320
the delta so that's their size

915
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
cumulative is less than a snapshot so

916
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,079
the idea is downloading a gigabyte of

917
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,680
deltas is better than downloading two

918
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,920
gigabytes of snapshot because it's still

919
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,920
less data however ir data based on some

920
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,839
rough

921
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,560
calculation is uh changing too slowly

922
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,480
and so a client that is running three

923
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,800
years behind on ripe would die would

924
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,119
still prefer deltas and would try to

925
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,920
download 250 000 of them which

926
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,720
obviously doesn't scale

927
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,280
so optimizing for size does not work

928
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,720
here next slide please

929
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,040
so the current new plan is uh we expire

930
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,280
fast after 24 hours so anyone who is

931
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,599
more than 24 hours behind has to

932
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,240
reinitialize from the snapshot

933
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,640
upside is this is simple you might still

934
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,520
have

935
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,960
1400 downloads if you're a day behind

936
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,359
although for many databases it would be

937
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,839
less

938
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,839
we feel that it would be a good balance

939
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,359
between allowing catcher preventing

940
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,920
excessive downloads and simplicity also

941
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,760
good to remember is this is all

942
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,160
automatic in nrtm version 3 this is all

943
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,440
manual like an operator has to actively

944
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
start the the fresh redownloading

945
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,400
process

946
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,200
another idea we had is delta irrigation

947
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
where we aggregate older ones into

948
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,119
larger blocks that are a single download

949
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,680
and can be processed in bulk

950
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,160
it's more optimal it's more complex

951
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,720
personally i don't like it so much

952
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,560
but of course we're also open to other

953
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,680
ideas

954
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,480
next slide please

955
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,359
so

956
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,480
the state is uh

957
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,280
the author of the draft uh ed works on

958
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,319
the database team at ripe ncc and i am

959
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,800
the author and maintainer of ird version

960
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,880
four so the authors we are also the

961
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
people who needs to work on

962
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,960
implementation so there's support from

963
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,000
there

964
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,800
uh the right database working group uh

965
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,640
i've also presented

966
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,839
a broad strokes of this in a off session

967
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,440
and that was generally supported so

968
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,760
there's support in other places also for

969
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,200
at least the general concept and ideas

970
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,359
it was posted on the mating list there

971
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,359
hasn't been any feedback yet

972
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,760
and i would like to propose this draft

973
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,040
for working group adoption

974
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,000
and that's it thank you

975
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,880
thank you so much sasha

976
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,760
the reason i invited sasha specifically

977
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,040
to the grow

978
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
working group

979
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
is that from all the ietf working groups

980
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,079
grow has a history of mingling with irr

981
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,920
related topics

982
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,800
so for instance in end of 2015 we

983
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,079
published rfc 76a2 considerations for

984
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,359
internet routing registries

985
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,839
there has not been

986
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,160
done in the ietf any prior work on nrtm

987
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,800
so nrtm version 3 is a two-page

988
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
specification hosted on the the ripe

989
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,040
website

990
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,640
so from that perspective it felt

991
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,160
appropriate to to bring it to this

992
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,359
working group

993
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,960
uh and the chairs will

994
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,560
bring the request to the mailing list to

995
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,839
guard interest

996
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,040
let's go through some questions i see

997
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,880
ben and jeff cued up

998
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,520
hi sasha ben madison from work online um

999
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,119
thank you for working on this it's

1000
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,319
really really long overdue um

1001
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,640
there are some really confusing topics

1002
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,200
that i have to take new recruits through

1003
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,000
um and what to do when an rtm version

1004
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,520
three breaks is i think probably the

1005
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,720
worst of it

1006
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,839
um

1007
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,280
so it's really nice to see someone who's

1008
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,440
actively working on this it looks i

1009
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,680
haven't i i i read

1010
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,240
a really really early

1011
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,680
markdown version of this that i came

1012
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,560
across

1013
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,760
somewhere

1014
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,000
but i haven't read the most recent draft

1015
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,599
but i think from what you've described

1016
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,359
it sounds like a sane solution to the to

1017
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,400
the problem

1018
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,760
one thing that i found slightly

1019
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,720
confusing is the the term session id

1020
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,280
because that seems like it's

1021
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,359
used not so much to identify a session

1022
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,160
between a server and a particular client

1023
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,119
as to identify the base from which a

1024
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,200
delta is taken

1025
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,240
so it's kind of identifying the current

1026
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,400
the current snapshot that's most recent

1027
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,079
so i think maybe a change of terminology

1028
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,880
there would make that less confusing

1029
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,960
um

1030
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,680
the

1031
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,040
i had one

1032
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,880
suggestion about how to deal with the

1033
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,599
trust anchor discovery problem um

1034
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,520
that's a little bit less hand wavy than

1035
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,280
kind of hoping that everybody knows that

1036
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,520
rad b is radbeed.net

1037
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,040
which is probably true it's probably not

1038
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,560
a terrible assumption but it's it's

1039
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,720
maybe not very robust

1040
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,800
one of the problems

1041
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,359
as an operator that mirrors

1042
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,359
irr data

1043
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,680
is there's not really

1044
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,240
a good list of things that one ought to

1045
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,680
be mirroring and there's not really a

1046
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,480
good list as a consumer of transit

1047
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,000
services for example of where am i

1048
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,319
which databases can i register my things

1049
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,160
in and expect them to be generally

1050
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,720
available to anyone who i care about and

1051
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,800
that's maybe a that may be a problem we

1052
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,040
can solve at the same time as this by

1053
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,079
having

1054
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,200
um

1055
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,920
by having an eye on a registry which is

1056
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
fairly permissive in terms of its you

1057
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,560
know its policies but where people can

1058
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,880
actually go and register source names

1059
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,200
um and that can then be mapped into the

1060
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,040
dns somehow or you know there's a whole

1061
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,119
bunch of one once you've got a registry

1062
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,480
of unique names like that and there's a

1063
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,560
mapping between source and somewhere to

1064
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,599
go then a whole bunch of possible

1065
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:48,960
solutions to that problem start

1066
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,839
presenting themselves

1067
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,359
yeah i i do like the ayana rs3 idea i

1068
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,279
think we had it briefly

1069
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,280
but then i was thinking like what if i

1070
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,079
email ayanna and i say hey i'm i'm ripe

1071
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,000
and here's the new key that should be

1072
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,599
used for update notification file and

1073
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,079
we're hosting it on this domain now

1074
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,680
which would also then need some kind of

1075
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,720
verification process but i think there

1076
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,440
are there are definitely ways to

1077
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,599
approach that this is sort of the the

1078
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,280
shortened version but

1079
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,520
i agree with you also like just in terms

1080
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,880
of

1081
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,760
what

1082
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,400
registries are out there and and like i

1083
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,240
sometimes have struggle finding like

1084
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,880
what red streaks are out there

1085
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,040
so i think the inner registry is uh

1086
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,000
interesting

1087
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,400
yeah i think that if the if the content

1088
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,839
the initial contents of that registry is

1089
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,880
bootstrapped in the draft with kind of

1090
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,800
you know the databases that are out

1091
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,640
there and are a thing

1092
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,280
then the you know the the the competing

1093
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,960
for the same source name problem

1094
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,599
probably doesn't really arise because it

1095
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,160
would only be new entrants or much much

1096
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,480
smaller databases that come after the

1097
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,599
fact

1098
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,760
asking for new names

1099
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,920
there are not a lot of new irr databases

1100
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,520
being stood up in 2022

1101
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,000
i'm going to cut the cue after rudiger

1102
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,280
folk

1103
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,599
ben you have an action item writes an

1104
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,040
internet draft defining an ayanna

1105
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,119
registry and some procedures around it

1106
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,440
that's called featurescope

1107
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,280
uh

1108
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,839
jeff house

1109
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,520
hi this is jeff

1110
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,000
sasha i have a question um

1111
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,839
last time i worked on this type of

1112
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,280
technology was back in 1999 for radb so

1113
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,319
things have obviously evolved

1114
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,839
significantly past that point and i'm

1115
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,839
not aware of them

1116
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,079
at that time one of the

1117
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,559
problems around the snapshot versus the

1118
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:49,760
incremental

1119
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,359
diffs that you get

1120
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,839
was a dual tension between

1121
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,000
the diffs basically encoding the

1122
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,359
transactions that have passed through

1123
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,880
the server people were interested in

1124
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,040
this for historical and other auditing

1125
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,480
reasons

1126
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,720
and the intention of being able to

1127
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,880
quickly resynchronize when things you

1128
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,280
know broke and fell out of sync

1129
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,280
this happened especially in those days

1130
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,319
quite a bit because the software is

1131
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,839
the reliability of the indices let's

1132
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,640
just say we're not very good at the time

1133
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,839
for the work that you're doing right now

1134
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,319
is the intention to try to reduce the

1135
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,960
amount of the delta files

1136
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,119
based on just strictly

1137
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,160
transaction load or is it a desire to

1138
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,599
simply

1139
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,359
limit the amount of traffic that you're

1140
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,640
expecting to see on the servers

1141
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,440
um

1142
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,280
well traffic on the servers is is

1143
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280
probably not the main concern the the

1144
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,160
the

1145
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,640
issue here is that if we allow a client

1146
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,880
to catch up with delta files after three

1147
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,400
years

1148
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,720
it'll take forever like the client will

1149
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,319
do this automatically it'll find that

1150
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,559
all the deltas are still there

1151
00:48:58,559 --> 00:48:59,839
but

1152
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,839
i don't immediately know of stuff my

1153
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,280
head how long it would take but

1154
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,000
downloading 250 000 separate files over

1155
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,119
http is going to take a while so we are

1156
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,760
not serving the client their goal is get

1157
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,319
the client up to speeds as fast as

1158
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,839
reasonable without excessive

1159
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,640
data transfer basically so that's why we

1160
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,319
want to place limits

1161
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,520
on how

1162
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,359
far back a client is allowed to go on

1163
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,800
this

1164
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,640
okay this is not actually going to help

1165
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,079
just downloading a snapshot is going to

1166
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,400
be faster at some point

1167
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,400
i completely agreed uh one of the other

1168
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,559
pieces of the tension was

1169
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,559
finding out what version effectively a

1170
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,000
given server is running for a given

1171
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,160
database was a

1172
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,079
non-standardized item has that changed

1173
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,880
in the interim

1174
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,640
sorry can you repeat the question

1175
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,880
so as an example uh the

1176
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,720
delta file gives you basically

1177
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,040
individual versions so if you're up to

1178
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,400
delta 100

1179
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,800
you know that this is as far as you

1180
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,680
happen to be in sync for this database

1181
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,359
um at the time i remember that ird for

1182
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,640
redb

1183
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,400
did have the ability to tell you what

1184
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,559
version it thought it was at for

1185
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,760
itself

1186
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,440
i don't recall if this actually got

1187
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,000
standardized

1188
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,839
the motivation is that if i'm running a

1189
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,119
local cache

1190
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,880
i could actually use that to compare

1191
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,079
versus maybe the remote cache

1192
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,240
um it it's kind of it's a little bit

1193
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,119
standardized like many things in ireland

1194
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,000
but

1195
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,480
in rtm v4 that would be the snapshot

1196
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,800
file so the snapshots

1197
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,680
sorry

1198
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,040
update notification file so whatever the

1199
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,880
update notification file says the latest

1200
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,480
version is that's latest version that

1201
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,040
was published

1202
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,359
there is to catch i suppose that what

1203
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,440
the server is running at right this

1204
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,720
second could be newer because it might

1205
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,720
take up to a minute for a change to be

1206
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,720
pushed out

1207
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,119
um

1208
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,119
okay or is that the kind of gap you're

1209
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,480
asking about

1210
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,160
i i think that is in the lines of what

1211
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,800
i'm asking about if it was the case that

1212
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,839
the

1213
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,440
manifest file

1214
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,800
that's reported

1215
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,000
uh is

1216
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,760
provided a conventional consistency

1217
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,599
because within a minute you'll get the

1218
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:18,880
newest data

1219
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,520
that's probably a reasonable thing

1220
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,640
if

1221
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,200
a fully standardized mechanism to query

1222
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,920
the database version number is not

1223
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,559
present that might be a thing to spend a

1224
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,000
little bit additional standardization

1225
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,400
time at because it allows a local cache

1226
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,280
mechanism to decide

1227
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,359
does it have data that is not fresh

1228
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,599
enough for some strange reason

1229
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,280
yeah yeah

1230
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,920
ird will also offer this because we have

1231
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,200
some non-standard queries right now

1232
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
they become sort of standard partially

1233
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,119
once they get implemented in ird version

1234
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,319
4 because

1235
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,040
there's there's uh right tb is the only

1236
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,760
other actively developed implementation

1237
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,920
uh but yeah there will be also direct

1238
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,559
queries but

1239
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,760
yeah the idea is this update

1240
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,680
notification file if you compare this to

1241
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,079
what your local version has then you'll

1242
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,319
know whether or not your mirroring is

1243
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,160
running up to date

1244
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,680
also we'll be able to actually detect

1245
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,599
errors so that will be a big improvement

1246
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,280
that if your local mirror cannot update

1247
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,200
that it can actually tell you that it

1248
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,280
can update rather than producing errors

1249
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,040
all the time that may not be actual

1250
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,720
errors as you have with version three

1251
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,240
the detection of local errors would be

1252
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,240
great i remember that at the time a

1253
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,240
significant problem during the mirroring

1254
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,119
process uh using one of your other

1255
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,480
example slides

1256
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,160
if you received an object that could not

1257
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,480
successfully be parsed locally because

1258
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,400
the implementations were different this

1259
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,319
led to potential situations where

1260
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,800
objects were out of sync

1261
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,720
yeah

1262
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,240
thank you for your time

1263
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,599
i think jeff

1264
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,000
in ird version 3 and nrcm version 3 you

1265
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,400
refer to the serials to

1266
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,040
corrupt the distance between local

1267
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,880
locally cached data and what the remote

1268
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,079
server has

1269
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,720
and in the nrtm version for notification

1270
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,760
file

1271
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,760
that is called the version

1272
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,440
so

1273
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,440
i pulled that slide up

1274
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,640
you see

1275
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,839
version three in nrtm version three

1276
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,559
lingo would be serial free okay now

1277
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,119
everybody is confused

1278
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,880
and again this is because i'm asking

1279
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,400
about technology that i've not done the

1280
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,160
appropriate homework for commenting on

1281
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,079
this presentation in an informed fashion

1282
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,240
and uh thank you for educating

1283
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,480
next up jarrett's

1284
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,319
um i'm looking at the clock a little bit

1285
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,520
so please keep the comments brief

1286
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,040
yeah so i guess i'm a little bit

1287
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,559
concerned about the one minute uh

1288
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,480
snapshot requirement is the reason why

1289
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,440
it isn't kind of done on demand based on

1290
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,520
when there's actually a change

1291
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,720
uh

1292
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,400
you know or for the uh you know for the

1293
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,720
deltas and such because that that seems

1294
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,759
like having that always

1295
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,640
misunderstanding then snapshots are more

1296
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,640
rare because they're very large deltas

1297
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,400
are one minute but only if there were

1298
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,040
changes if your ir database never

1299
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,760
changes the only thing you have to do is

1300
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,720
update this update notification file

1301
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,200
which is very small just to

1302
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,720
sort of clients you know like there's

1303
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,559
someone still publishing to this to this

1304
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,520
endpoint

1305
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,680
yeah no changes means you don't you

1306
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,440
don't generate anything

1307
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,599
okay and then the second concern i have

1308
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,640
is about uh whether or not ayanna is the

1309
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,160
right place for there to be a registry

1310
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,760
for services that may not exist in the

1311
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,000
future because i think many of us have

1312
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,440
seen

1313
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,920
irr databases come online and go away

1314
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,119
over time

1315
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,440
and going and sticking it in a registry

1316
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,680
seems a lot more permanent than what

1317
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,280
actually exists in the operational space

1318
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,040
please talk to ben he

1319
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,000
will

1320
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,359
figure out all those concerns

1321
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,599
rudiger

1322
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,520
retired backbone engineer

1323
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,960
uh

1324
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,200
i wanted to jump on europe's remark that

1325
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,040
nrtm never had an official standardized

1326
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,050
standardized definition

1327
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,280
[Music]

1328
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,000
at least not ietf

1329
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,359
as far as i remember

1330
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:34,400
there has been for quarter of a century

1331
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,240
irr

1332
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,000
schema definition

1333
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,760
done in itf as far as i can tell

1334
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,280
no

1335
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,280
excess protocol no on the wire protocol

1336
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,400
so far as i can tell has ever been

1337
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,720
standardized in ietf

1338
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,000
and

1339
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
the existing

1340
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,400
de facto registry

1341
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,000
does not even include the information

1342
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,720
what software is run

1343
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,319
by the various registries which is

1344
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,680
necessary

1345
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,720
for

1346
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,000
tuning or selecting your client code for

1347
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,480
successfully accessing the stuff

1348
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,520
it's not only this

1349
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,079
i know it by heart from the time when i

1350
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,280
still was working

1351
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,440
not not quite sure not quite sure

1352
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,760
uh whether this will actually be fixed

1353
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,640
uh before the thing is forgotten and uh

1354
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,839
replaced by something else and better

1355
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,880
yeah i did mention that nrtm never has

1356
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,200
been standardized by the ietf

1357
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,799
but given the history of ietf

1358
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,119
in irr

1359
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,160
i felt that nrcm version 4 might be an

1360
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,200
uh find an appropriate home here but

1361
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,799
we'll discuss this on the mailing list

1362
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,880
in the working group call for adoption

1363
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,920
the reason the offers

1364
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,680
are here is is to make something better

1365
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,359
than a two-page pdf hidden on a website

1366
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,319
but make a proper document that is easy

1367
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:25,960
to read and understand

1368
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,720
sasha thank you so much uh for your

1369
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,520
presentation and information

1370
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,920
uh i think we are gonna move on to the

1371
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,079
last presentation of the grow session

1372
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,520
hey hello good to see you

1373
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,920
where on this planet are you

1374
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,240
i'm in colombia very early okay it's not

1375
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,799
too early

1376
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:06,720
so we are

1377
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,440
we're in a hurry right or or we are not

1378
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,040
tell me uh we're

1379
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,880
we started like three minutes late so

1380
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,240
we'll end like six minutes late right

1381
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,720
perfect so can you go into the next

1382
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,680
slide please um

1383
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,680
so what we are proposing in this draft

1384
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,799
is basically a young module for com for

1385
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,839
managing bmp on routers

1386
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,359
why not uh

1387
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:32,799
well the idea is to have a standard way

1388
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,960
of doing that bmp sounds like a simple

1389
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,680
protocol but is it well simple protocol

1390
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,640
to configure and manage but is it

1391
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,040
let's figure out ourselves while having

1392
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,520
these discussions

1393
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,319
the next one please

1394
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,960
um so what the

1395
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,599
model has basically i mean are the items

1396
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,240
to configure and monitor vmp on devices

1397
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,200
that is

1398
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,359
uh well configure your stations the

1399
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,680
connectivity for your stations the bmp

1400
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,599
session

1401
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:04,960
parameters

1402
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,760
um i like to highlight two things that

1403
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,920
probably are not so common between the

1404
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,920
models of the vendors that at least we

1405
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,599
have read

1406
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,400
um first is an action to clear the

1407
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,839
to clear the session with the bmp

1408
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,680
station uh

1409
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,760
well that's basically it

1410
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,799
and the second part is that we are we

1411
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,160
try to be very explicit in

1412
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,559
how we configure what we call the

1413
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,720
bmp sources um

1414
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,839
and that is

1415
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,880
we right now have already uh uh five

1416
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,000
remotes on bmb the the latest three were

1417
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,440
standardized

1418
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,160
um just a few months ago

1419
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,079
so you have to be explicit on whether to

1420
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,880
say you this remote is enabled for the

1421
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,880
station then for others families the

1422
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,359
same so for every address families you

1423
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,359
don't take there's no default you have

1424
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,799
to enable every others family

1425
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,359
and for the rib modes that are actually

1426
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,000
not a single rib but multiple ribs per

1427
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,200
pier

1428
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,400
then we also would like to be explicit

1429
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,200
that is you can def so you you enable

1430
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,880
the peers

1431
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,119
that you want to send information from

1432
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,480
or to

1433
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,040
uh explicitly you can select that

1434
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,319
individually

1435
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,799
so by using the

1436
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,799
by reusing the remote address from the

1437
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,400
bgp module

1438
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,720
uh also by the type also you can define

1439
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,799
which peers you want to

1440
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:34,240
to select based on the type of beer uh

1441
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,240
here we are also reusing the um the bgp

1442
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,640
peer type from the bgpa module

1443
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,440
so

1444
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,480
you can say

1445
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,480
please send me the information from all

1446
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,599
the external peers for the internals

1447
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,359
and so on

1448
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:52,880
um because we also needed a way of um

1449
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,680
of of especially saying we want all

1450
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,480
peers that's why we also added uh an

1451
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,160
enum with a with a single value called

1452
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,000
appears in the vgp mode and the bmp

1453
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,680
module in this module

1454
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,359
uh that you can use to say okay you'll

1455
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,760
send me everything for every year

1456
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,760
we probably will discuss this a bit more

1457
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,240
in the next iterations of the module

1458
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,440
but let's see

1459
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,079
next one please

1460
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,319
so we already had a good feedback on

1461
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,559
this thank you very much for to team

1462
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,799
jeffrey and tom for this

1463
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,359
um we already addressed some of them

1464
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,160
some of the issues uh

1465
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,480
mostly the ones from tom that were very

1466
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,640
low thinking fruits and some of them

1467
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,240
very clear mistakes

1468
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,480
in this version that we already uploaded

1469
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,040
versions 0.2 i'm not going to go into

1470
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,559
the details

1471
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,880
uh next one please

1472
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,720
yeah

1473
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,119
so we do have some some pending points

1474
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,119
um that we promised to tackle in the

1475
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,799
next version

1476
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,359
uh tim mentioned the vmp session options

1477
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,760
initialization delay backup times

1478
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,640
uh

1479
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,480
we will actually re

1480
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,160
take a look again to all the modules

1481
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,640
from the vendors that for

1482
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,200
for configuring bmp

1483
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,680
and see what else we might be missing

1484
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,440
to try to add them

1485
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,240
um

1486
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,039
jeffrey mentioned the tcp module that is

1487
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,680
um that is um i mean we can really

1488
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,920
leverage that module to try to

1489
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,200
another invent the wheel uh how to use

1490
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,520
it we're really not sure that for

1491
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,839
instance we could actually copy the four

1492
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,720
the four um the four tuple

1493
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,559
uh connection from there

1494
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,559
uh it's not in a grouping so maybe we

1495
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,599
can just copy it or i don't know or

1496
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,839
we'll see how we can integrate it and

1497
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:38,880
maybe

1498
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,440
and then we can discuss it all together

1499
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,599
units for stats where to place the

1500
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,520
module in the routing tree uh this can

1501
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,200
be important so we so if we for instance

1502
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,520
uh we put in under network instance then

1503
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,000
we can you know we can use the we can

1504
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,119
directly

1505
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,799
um

1506
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:58,720
we can directly monitor those the

1507
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,039
network instance from there or we can

1508
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,240
put the network instance in a bmp source

1509
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,319
so where to place the model the module

1510
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,559
the model is um

1511
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,400
it's a good question to have and of

1512
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,319
course adding examples to

1513
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,960
i mean to enlighten

1514
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,119
these trade-offs

1515
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,720
uh next one please john

1516
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,880
so this is it uh

1517
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,119
well grove works on the vmp and we have

1518
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:27,039
been working in the last few years about

1519
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:28,559
this so i think it makes sense to have

1520
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,799
this draft in the group

1521
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,599
but i also let you guys discuss that

1522
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,599
besides that if you guys have any other

1523
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:39,440
questions or comments guys and girls

1524
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:42,880
[Music]

1525
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,359
thank you um

1526
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:49,200
jeff has you're up first

1527
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,039
uh so yes i absolutely think we should

1528
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,880
adopt this i agree that there's gonna be

1529
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,079
a little bit of churn as we figure out

1530
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,760
how do we actually monitor the various

1531
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,200
address families

1532
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,200
within networking it's going to be i

1533
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,960
think when we're modeling challenges

1534
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,319
we're actually going through a similar

1535
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:09,680
effort through that in my employer right

1536
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,319
now jennifer

1537
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,039
the second item is about the tcp

1538
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,240
integration

1539
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,599
partially what being discussed here is

1540
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:20,799
do you want to actually do something

1541
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,720
model the connection is something that

1542
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,960
is a little copy and paste

1543
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,200
in a lot of cases that can make sense

1544
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,078
many other cases

1545
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,480
part of the reason to point you towards

1546
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,599
the

1547
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,200
tcp module

1548
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,160
and potentially longer term discussion

1549
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,039
towards the itf key chain module

1550
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,559
is you'll want to figure out how

1551
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,720
authentication actually rolls into this

1552
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,440
so if you're running like tcp ao or tls

1553
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,960
or something else similar for the

1554
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,000
sessions

1555
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,760
you'll want to model that not only for

1556
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,599
configuration purposes but you know what

1557
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,039
your operational state is for that

1558
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,240
that's it thank you

1559
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,680
and i agree with jeffrey

1560
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,118
next up

1561
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,359
yeah i think this is a useful work uh

1562
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:16,240
really

1563
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,240
helpful for the

1564
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,480
configuration of the bmp

1565
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,559
uh my uh brief comment is that uh it is

1566
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,480
better to consider

1567
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,920
the alignment with the the pgp model

1568
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,599
like the

1569
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,920
uh maybe it is first based on the

1570
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,200
instance and then peers and ribs

1571
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,319
follow the

1572
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:39,839
because that

1573
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,240
user of the bmp young will be

1574
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,280
also the users for the bgp models so

1575
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,039
that the alignment between these two

1576
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,000
models will be very helpful

1577
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,400
second one is also

1578
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,559
based on the young model

1579
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,400
design in the bjp model it may

1580
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,039
reduce the amount of configurations in

1581
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,920
some circum circumstances but for each

1582
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,640
uh

1583
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,079
rape you may

1584
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,000
need to with this current model you may

1585
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,079
need to configure the different peers

1586
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,039
for different ribs but with

1587
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,680
if you follow the b2pm model style you

1588
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,640
can

1589
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,119
configure the peer then the rib and

1590
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:20,640
rebound can

1591
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,480
just

1592
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,920
follow it under the peer model

1593
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,160
that is uh yeah

1594
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,079
for some more detailed comments we can

1595
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,760
maybe have some further discussion of

1596
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,160
flying

1597
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,720
thank you

1598
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,960
thank you and and our purpose here is to

1599
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,319
to reuse the

1600
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:43,200
bgp module as much as possible i mean we

1601
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,720
try maybe we are missing some we're

1602
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,839
having some gaps but there is yeah so

1603
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,960
indeed address families and peers

1604
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,440
and even peer types are right now

1605
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,920
reference than the vgp module when when

1606
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,720
we find a location into the into the

1607
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,920
routing tree we might be even be able to

1608
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,599
make it more direct

1609
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:04,400
yeah

1610
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,280
but that's that's the day okay

1611
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,319
thanks

1612
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,640
thank you

1613
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,559
um

1614
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:13,839
all right so the to-do item for the

1615
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:16,640
chairs appears to be to issue a call for

1616
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,440
working group adoption uh this would be

1617
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,440
i think the first time the grow working

1618
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,520
group has any involvement with

1619
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,359
yang

1620
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:26,960
so there there might be a bit of a

1621
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,039
learning curve for some of us at least

1622
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,000
for for me myself

1623
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,200
but together we are strong

1624
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,160
um

1625
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,920
john thank you so much for this

1626
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,359
presentation

1627
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,119
and

1628
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,039
this concludes the grow

1629
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,480
session at iatf 113 i hope to see all of

1630
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,240
you at iatf 114 in philadelphia

1631
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,520
and a

1632
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,920
big thank you to the meat echo team i

1633
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,319
have to say this has been the smoothest

1634
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,079
running hybrid

1635
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,559
session i have been part of so

1636
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,400
folks behind the camera thank you very

1637
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,240
much

1638
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,039
um

1639
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,520
well go enjoy your break and see you

1640
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,759
next time

1641
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,640
thank you

1642
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,559
i'll do that
