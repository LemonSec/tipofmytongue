38
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,159

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,440

i'm sure you've seen this thing and uh

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,599
this is preferential treatment for the

59
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,319
remote users who can actually sit with

60
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,400
the reading glasses and read this as

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,360
opposed to the people in the room who

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,080
have to squint

63
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,700
um

64
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,159

69
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,959
a large bearing on what happens if you

70
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,760

71
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,560

more

134
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,520
it took many months to get a d feedback

135
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
resolved and now we're seeing

136

a bunch of months waiting for the isg

137
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
kind of feedback result

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000

we need more authors or editors i i

140
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,880
don't know how to make this go faster

141
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
but it seems like there's a lot of

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,319
waiting always

143
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,600

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,240
document status part

176
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,840
so um i can be client we've had

177
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
i think no traffic

178
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,120
on the list since the last itf

179
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
um so yeah

180
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,758
kathleen can you

181
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,800
george a couple of comments we should

182
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,880
start to see traffic pick up on this

183
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,679
because of several efforts around supply

184
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,279
chain security

185
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,719
and essentially tying into s-bombs and

186
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,479
signatures for

187
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,440
code signing signatures on software and

188
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,519
so um

189
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,440
either for the next meeting cycle or the

190
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,519
one after that and i'll be reaching out

191
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,160
to some of the folks on acme because

192
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,760
sigstor for instance is being used but

193
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,800
doesn't quite match the workflow for

194
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,560
acme and

195
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
it would be good to have that use a

196
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
standard and so

197
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,240
their workflow does an open id call

198
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
first and that information is packaged

199
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,839
up and then

200
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
um is used to generate the certificate

201
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,240
and it's just slightly different from

202
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
how acme works so

203
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
um i'm going to be reaching out to a few

204
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,920
people to see if we can collaborate and

205
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,440
um determine the best path forward

206
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,800
because i think

207
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,560
sig store could be further secured by

208
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,720
using acme

209
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
and then there's one other effort that i

210
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,680
don't think i can mention the name of

211
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,360
yet so there should be some pretty big

212
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,000
efforts that will likely tap into this

213
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,399
okay thank you thank you

214
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,519
thank you okay

215
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,240
so

216
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,279
another thing that is not a

217
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
working document but we have

218
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,480
looking at it since uh last itf is the

219
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,800
acme renewal information

220
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,040
uh there is there have been some threads

221
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,800
in the list and having more than one

222
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,680
thread

223
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,360
for acme document is pretty good

224
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,880
at this time

225
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
no new revision since last itf but we

226
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,399
are having a presentation later so

227
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,880
let's wait for that

228
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
um

229
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,320
okay so

230
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,959
and acme integrations and acme

231
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,120
subdomains um

232
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,839
there's both had the new versions uh one

233
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,760
in december one in march

234
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
and

235
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,040
both of them seem like they have

236
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
synchronized slides are asking us if

237
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
we're ready for working with last calls

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,680
on kind of foreshadowing

239
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,760
their presentations

240
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,640
so

241
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,800
that's it for document status

242
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,120
anything we've forgotten any agenda

243
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,360
bashing

244
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,079
no okay so the only thing is when you're

245
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,079
in the room you have to to go to the mic

246
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,519
you have to join

247
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,040
the medical mic cue raise your hands

248
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
okay

249
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
so um

250
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,959
next thing is uh dta node id um yeah

251
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,079
brian

252
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,839
i'll

253
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,480
see how i get to release this share

254
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,920
screen

255
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,839
yeah

256
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,880
or do you want us to uh share the

257
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,480
brian do you want to do the slides we

258
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,760
can probably

259
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,880
if you can bring them up then i can flip

260
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,399
through them i said

261
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,600
i um

262
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
yeah if i just

263
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
managed oh there's

264
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
thing

265
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,800
yes i'll share no not share screen

266
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,880
what i want to do is share

267
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,839
slides

268
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,279
okay because it's really only the one

269
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,800
slide so if you can just flip to the

270
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,040
next

271
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,519
okay okay

272
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,360
um so

273
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
the most recent version uh dash nine was

274
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
uh published recently um

275
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,560
one

276
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,079
editorial change but it is a big help is

277
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,440
that the dtn documents that are

278
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,160
referenced are now actually rfcs

279
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,920
published um so that is good

280
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,320
the references to those were updated uh

281
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
the major changes since dash six and

282
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,839
some of these were what remit had

283
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,680
mentioned on the mailing list message um

284
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,760
one of them is editorial adding a more

285
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,240
explanation of dtn terminology and and

286
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,440
hopefully helping the reader to

287
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,959
understand what this document is

288
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,720
supposed to be covering and what it's

289
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,760
not

290
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,639
um the second change

291
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,839
this is uh structural changing the the

292
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,279
logic uh for the better is separating

293
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,959
the tokens from the

294
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,720
challenge identifier

295
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,519
and

296
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,360
because of this separation it avoids

297
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,519
overlaps in in how these things are used

298
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,040
and what they mean

299
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,680
and it also brings this behavior

300
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,079
uh into very close alignment with rfc

301
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,600
8823

302
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
the email validation so the logic that

303
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,680
applies there and here

304
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,360
now is

305
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,200
practically identical the only

306
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,839
difference being the transport of

307
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,959
email versus dtn bundles

308
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,120
the one other structural change that was

309
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
made

310
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,000
in this last edit

311
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
was based on

312
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,560
some advice future looking advice was

313
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
rather than the 8823 method of saying

314
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,480
that the

315
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,959
key authorization digest is always the

316
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,000
shot 256 what this is doing is adding

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,279
algorithm agility in the protocol

318
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,839
to have the acme server provide a list

319
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,040
of what

320
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,240
algorithms it finds acceptable and have

321
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
the client choose one

322
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,079
and use that as the

323
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,320
the key authorization digest now shot

324
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,199
256 is still mandatory to be present in

325
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,120
that list but it doesn't have to be the

326
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,279
highest priority and or and it doesn't

327
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,279
have to be the only element

328
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,839
uh and then the last three changes were

329
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,199
typos

330
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,519
and some some editorial comments

331
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
so the one known issue as far as the

332
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,760
document is concerned and this is not

333
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,920
strictly an issue is just that

334
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
the hash algorithms registry that this

335
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,279
is referencing

336
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,680
is not a published rfc yet it's still in

337
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,399
auth48 but it is um

338
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,800
going through the the last stages of

339
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,959
getting that out and it is part of the

340
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,720
cozy discussion

341
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,880
at a co-timed meeting with this acme

342
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,680
but as roman had mentioned there there's

343
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,000
two changes of separating the the tokens

344
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,199
and ids

345
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,079
and adding the algorithm agility are

346
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,920
changes to the

347
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,120
logic

348
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
but not changes to the overall workflow

349
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
or the

350
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,199
goals

351
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,639
so can we get some

352
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,079
people to volunteer to review

353
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,319
don't jump at once thank you alexi

354
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,440
i like how changing must not to last is

355
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,600
an editorial change

356
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,399
well

357
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,079
it originally was must and then got

358
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,800
typoed into

359
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,360
or the other way around

360
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,750
it was undoing a bad typo earlier

361
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,270
[Laughter]

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,360
all right so if we can get a couple

363
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,920
people to review and

364
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,560
say it's okay

365
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,160
okay and as always we'll take you to the

366
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,240
list to get uh

367
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,120
more volunteers

368
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,079
okay

369
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,120
anything else any

370
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,199
comments uh

371
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,120
screams and groans

372
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,480
moans and niggles

373
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,399
okay

374
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,880
so uh thank you brian

375
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,639
and

376
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,440
on to the next

377
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,839
so yeah

378
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,160
uh

379
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,199
all right hello everyone it is

380
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,600
5 am on the west coast of

381
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,560
the united states so uh any typos in his

382
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,480
slides i'm going to blame on it being 5

383
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,440
a.m right now and not

384
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,040
regardless of what time i actually made

385
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,560
them

386
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,639
uh control your own slides or do you

387
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,480
want to let go of change largely

388
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,040
oh doesn't matter in the slightest to me

389
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,079
yeah so oh i'll keep doing this

390
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,120
sure next slide

391
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,399
um

392
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,600
new version uh zero two has not yet been

393
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
published uh i am

394
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,800
still

395
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,560
new to figuring out how all this works

396
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,079
and i didn't realize there was like the

397
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,519
publication freeze right before the

398
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,560
meeting

399
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,440
um

400
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,759
so there there are some changes in the

401
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,599
pipeline coming up but they will be

402
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,880
published as uh draft zero two shortly

403
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,599
after ietf113 is over

404
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,640
um gonna go over what those changes are

405
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,039
in detail but basically updated url

406
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,720
construction as a result of feedback on

407
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,839
the list

408
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,640
uh

409
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,599
a

410
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,400
new renewal complete endpoint uh that

411
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,079
we'll talk about a little bit and then

412
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,799
just a bunch of small edits cleaning up

413
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,480
references and dates and things like

414
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,600
that

415
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,159
next slide

416
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
so this part is the same uh url

417
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,799
construction is still based on a base

418
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,720
path contained in the directory this new

419
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,200
renewal info key that points at an

420
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,400
endpoint next slide

421
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
but

422
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,240
rather than constructing the path after

423
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,720
that endpoint is a series of slash

424
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,799
delimited path elements each based on

425
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,480
different aspects of the certificate

426
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,440
we're just cribbing wholesale from ocsp

427
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,760
and taking the cert id asn 1 sequence

428
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,000
from an ocsp request

429
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,720
which contains the certificate serial

430
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,679
number

431
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,840
hashes of its issuer name and issuer key

432
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,559
and for algorithm agility the hash

433
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,280
algorithm used to hash the issuer name

434
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,410
and the issuer key

435
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,640
[Music]

436
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,440
the full ocsp request wrapped around

437
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,120
this has a bunch of things that we don't

438
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,600
really need in particular things like

439
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,240
the ability to request multiple ocsp

440
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,520
responses at the same time or ocsp

441
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,760
extensions and ocsp individual entry

442
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,160
extensions we don't want any of those

443
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,320
things so we're going with just this

444
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,120
cert id component

445
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,360
but similar to how

446
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,520
the acme spec currently does things like

447
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,320
uh

448
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,799
passing certificates back and forth like

449
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,039
when you fetch a certificate that's a

450
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,240
bunch of

451
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
base64 url encoded data that gets

452
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
returned by the server we're doing the

453
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,480
same thing here you

454
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,720
have this dur object uh you

455
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,160
uh

456
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,880
base you you have this asn 1 object you

457
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,440
encode it as dur you encode that as

458
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,919
base64 url and that's the format that

459
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,840
you use on the network to pass things

460
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
back and forth so we

461
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,720
encode this whole thing as base64 url

462
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,200
strip the any padding equals signs from

463
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
the end just like you do in other parts

464
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,160
of uh

465
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,760
acme and that is the path component and

466
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,679
then you make a get request to

467
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,200
the renewal info endpoint slash that

468
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,960
giant blob

469
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,280
next slide

470
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,120
this i i felt like having a fun diagram

471
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,600
here this is uh basically just all the

472
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,039
components that are necessary to

473
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,880
construct this request

474
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,440
if your client can construct an ocsp

475
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,159
request then your client can construct a

476
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,960
re request it's exactly the same pieces

477
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,440
of data going into it just with

478
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
fewer layers of wrapping around the

479
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,880
outside but

480
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,840
you have a cacer you have the end of

481
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,480
tcert you have a hash algorithm you

482
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,600
construct this object a64 url it and

483
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,480
that's how you build the url

484
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,919
um

485
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,559
next slide

486
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,799
uh yeah so you concatenate that here

487
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,039
i've split that base64 url into multiple

488
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,720
lines for the sake of readability but

489
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,320
you just concatenate the base url slash

490
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,960
the base64 url path component make a get

491
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,039
request and

492
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,840
all the rest of this is the same as in

493
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,200
version zero one uh the server responses

494
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,559
identical same status codes uh same

495
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,240
retry after etc so no changes in the

496
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,960
rest of it there

497
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,840
next slide

498
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,720
uh

499
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,320
we're adding

500
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,760
a second utility to

501
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,400
uh this document it's still part of the

502
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,360
renewal endpoint a renewal info endpoint

503
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,960
but uh in addition to having this get

504
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,679
functionality just to get the renewal

505
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,600
the suggested renewal window for your

506
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,440
certificate we're also adding the

507
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,720
ability to do a post as get request to

508
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
the same endpoint

509
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,360
to

510
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,440
update the renewal

511
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,559
state of the certificate uh so basically

512
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,400
the idea is

513
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,039
if you are polling the renewal info url

514
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,960
or the renewal info endpoint to

515
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,520
determine when it is best to renew your

516
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,000
your certificate and then you get a

517
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,880
response that says hey renew sometime in

518
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,360
the next six hours and you do your

519
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,520
random number generation to determine

520
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,120
when in that six hour window you should

521
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,240
renew and you do the renewal

522
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,720
then you can let the acme server know

523
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,520
hey

524
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,159
from my perspective this certificate has

525
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,480
been renewed and replaced

526
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,280
uh

527
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,960
this lets the server do a bunch of real

528
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,559
well first

529
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,720
the way you do this is

530
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,400
bog standard acme uh you make a post as

531
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,320
get request to the renewal info url

532
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,600
in the directory the body of that post

533
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,039
is get request is formatted exactly the

534
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,200
same way you've got the protected

535
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,400
section with the key id the nonce the

536
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,240
url that you're making the request to

537
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,400
for the sake of replay protection you've

538
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,280
got the signature and the payload is

539
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,080
that same exact cert id from the get

540
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,600
request encoded in exactly the same way

541
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,280
which is the same way that you make a

542
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,080
revocation request to acme it's the

543
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,880
base64 url of the dir of the whole

544
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,720
certificate body for a revocation

545
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,480
request here it's base64 url of dur of

546
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,000
the cert id

547
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,640
and a little bit of metadata

548
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,039
right now the only metadata is this kind

549
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:19,760
of

550
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,440
redundant seeming replaced true thing

551
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
but we can imagine other kinds of

552
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,919
metadata and that's part of the open

553
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,840
questions at the end here

554
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,039
um

555
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,000
so you make this this update request and

556
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
then the server can use this information

557
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,480
for a bunch of things

558
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,679
um

559
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,679
in particular

560
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,600
uh yeah go on to the next slide

561
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,799
uh right so one thing here is obviously

562
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,400
this request must be signed by the

563
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,640
original subscribers

564
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,520
key

565
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,440
for revocation there's like three

566
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,520
different kinds of revocation paths it

567
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,720
can be signed by the original

568
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
subscribers key it can be signed by the

569
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,440
key of a subscriber

570
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,600
who has proven control of all of the

571
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,320
names in the certificate or it can be

572
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,200
signed by the certificate key itself

573
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,960
here no

574
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,600
just the subscriber's key there's no

575
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
reason for anyone else to update this

576
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,159
that's added complication

577
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,200
um

578
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,520
like if we can talk about that maybe

579
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,279
there's other reasons for it but for now

580
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,799
we're saying just the original

581
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,670
subscriber's key um

582
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,080
[Music]

583
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
and

584
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,240
then the server can use this information

585
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,640
for a variety of things

586
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,159
including

587
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,600
not sending reminders like saying hey

588
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,080
your certificate is about to expire make

589
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,400
sure you renew if you have a positive

590
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
confirmation that it's already been

591
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,320
renewed and replaced don't bother doing

592
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,120
that

593
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,720
uh if someone keeps polling for renewal

594
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
info after a cert has already been

595
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,400
marked as replaced

596
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,720
just start returning empty bodies or

597
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,279
errors because the cert doesn't need to

598
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,880
be renewed anymore it's renewal

599
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,320
information is

600
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
don't

601
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,880
and uh

602
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,360
in sort of the most emergency case

603
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,159
uh

604
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
if the ca is in the process of

605
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
revoking and replacing a bunch of certs

606
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,480
having a positive confirmation that this

607
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,200
cert has been replaced already can let

608
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
the ca revoke it knowing that it is

609
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,919
completely safe to do so as opposed to

610
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,760
potentially causing

611
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,200
operational problems for the subscriber

612
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,760
um so those are some of the benefits of

613
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,960
having this new endpoint um

614
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,720
yeah i only have one slide left but it

615
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,919
looks like we have a question from

616
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,760
michael before i go on to open questions

617
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,880
michael richardson at the mic um so the

618
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,960
question you said something that if the

619
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,039
certificate has already been replaced

620
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,039
that you could just replace to return an

621
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,400
empty body

622
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,520
uh because it doesn't need to be

623
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,799
replaced

624
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,600
and i'm thinking about the situation

625
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,240
where you have some

626
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,880
monitoring system that's monitoring

627
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,159
things

628
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,480
and

629
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,799
i'm thinking that it might actually like

630
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,640
to know

631
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,720
what certificate replaced

632
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,080
it

633
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,919
does that make sense and so i'm thinking

634
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,679
empty body might not really be the right

635
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,960
answer there

636
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,760
or maybe yeah

637
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,279
yeah we've been thinking exactly the

638
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,799
same thing and you have if you actually

639
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,200
go onto the next slide okay there you go

640
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,320
um yeah so one of the open questions

641
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,120
that i've been thinking about is like

642
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,640
what other metadata might we want in

643
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,720
this certificate

644
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,279
renewed update and one of the ideas

645
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,840
we've had is the serial of the

646
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
replacement cert or perhaps even the

647
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,760
full cert id of the replacement cert

648
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,159
and that would let us do exactly that

649
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,640
sort of thing oh it's been replaced by

650
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
this sir great we can provide that

651
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,919
information

652
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:12,960
um

653
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,480
in general the mapping of one cert to

654
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
its replacement is a very hard problem

655
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,640
uh speaking from let's encrypt

656
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,399
experience

657
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,840
lots of large integrators do things like

658
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,799
issue a hundred certs for a hundred

659
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,399
names each based on which domains are

660
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,360
behind which load balancers and then

661
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,039
three months later when they come back

662
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,200
and renew all of their certs those names

663
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,600
are completely shuffled between the

664
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,039
certs and so mapping oh this cert is a

665
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,279
replacement to that one is very

666
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,720
difficult because they have totally

667
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
different sets of names

668
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,679
and so

669
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,720
yeah it would sort of push that mapping

670
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,039
onto the client to say

671
00:27:59,039 --> 00:27:59,919
hey

672
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,840
you not only tell us when you have

673
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,240
satisfactorily replaced the serp but you

674
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,840
tell us what you believe actually

675
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,200
replaced it

676
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,799
um so yeah this is one of the things

677
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,039
we're thinking about we don't know the

678
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,960
answer here yet whether this is

679
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,000
sufficiently valuable to justify the

680
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,679
extra bytes on the wire but maybe it is

681
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,640
um

682
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
yeah so that's one of the big open

683
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
questions still um

684
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,480
another open question is related to one

685
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,840
of the

686
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,240
email threads that is on the acme

687
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,760
mailing list this explanation uri

688
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,720
uh it's not a big open question i'm

689
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,399
pretty sure

690
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,720
i want to include this uh

691
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,880
the there hasn't been a whole lot of

692
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
discussion about it um basically the

693
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,039
idea is

694
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,000
hey let's recognize that

695
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,399
acme clients are not

696
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,840
the only

697
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,480
client in the ecosystem

698
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,399
there are other players in the ecosystem

699
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,120
such as certificate monitoring systems

700
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,159
who have their own customer base of

701
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,640
people who want to know oh my goodness

702
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,480
my certificate hasn't been renewed i

703
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,399
don't have good monitoring on my acme

704
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,120
client but i do have this service that

705
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,679
pings my domain name every 24 hours and

706
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,360
lets me know if my certificate is too

707
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,200
close to expiration

708
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,000
and so certificate monitoring services

709
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,279
could do things like

710
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,799
could provide additional value

711
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,080
essentially

712
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,919
if they had

713
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,039
additional information about

714
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,600
why a certificate has a particular

715
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,120
renewal window

716
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,360
and in the normal case this is just

717
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,520
going to be your certificate has this

718
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,640
renewal window because

719
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,960
that's a safe number of days before it's

720
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,799
going to expire

721
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,159
but sometimes it might be your

722
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,919
certificate has this renewal window

723
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,279
because

724
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,720
rca does dynamic load balancing and it

725
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,399
was determined that your certificate

726
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,080
should be renewed a little bit earlier

727
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,039
or a little bit later to avoid this

728
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,360
midnight traffic spike

729
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,080
or sometimes it's your certificate was

730
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,159
part of a mass education event and

731
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,159
should be renewed early so that you

732
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,240
don't have operational difficulties when

733
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,080
your certificate gets revoked in 48

734
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,279
hours

735
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,640
um

736
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,600
so

737
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,039
yeah there's sort of this idea that the

738
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,200
response the renewal info response could

739
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,559
contain a url pointing at

740
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,760
a web document that describes uh the

741
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,480
current reasoning behind the renewal

742
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,440
window and that that url could be blank

743
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,919
most of the time but set in certain

744
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,760
circumstances when it might be useful to

745
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,799
the user

746
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,880
uh and to

747
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,120
clients that are more interactive than

748
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,039
the average acme client

749
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,480
clients like

750
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,840
certificate monitoring systems

751
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,120
so yeah those are the things that we're

752
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,760
still thinking about right now uh plan

753
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,960
to

754
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,919
publish version two in

755
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,640
like a week and a half after this this

756
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
whole week of meetings is over

757
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,519
um

758
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,159
yeah any other questions comments things

759
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,360
like that

760
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,880
yeah you could do it right now if you

761
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,200
want it

762
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,240
i i'm treating the whole document like

763
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,000
any other code project getting code

764
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,399
reviews from various other uh

765
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,080
configurators and stuff like that and so

766
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,760
all of the changes i discussed today are

767
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,799
currently in that code review stage

768
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,159
so getting like minor editorial feedback

769
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,480
on them

770
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,120
okay so since the myq is still empty

771
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,039
i'll ask my two questions um so one

772
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,600
regarding the explanation uri are you

773
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,840
planning to

774
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,799
um also standardize the content of

775
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,440
that resource

776
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,640
not

777
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,120
the idea is no um

778
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,000
i'm happy to talk about other reasons

779
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,080
but the idea is basically like

780
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,840
this is something that is actually

781
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,799
intended for the human not for

782
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,760
mechanical systems to process the url is

783
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,480
intended for mechanical systems to send

784
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,279
in an email or whatever but then the

785
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,440
contents of that page should just be a

786
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,679
page that can run javascript in order to

787
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,200
determine what locale it should

788
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,120
translate the page into and all that

789
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
sort of stuff so

790
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
the idea is that it would just be a web

791
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,919
page i see

792
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,159
so no uh cozy object or anything just uh

793
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,159
just having natural language

794
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,840
yeah happy to take suggestions but not

795
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,880
at this time

796
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,120
okay so that was my uh participant

797
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,320
question now my chair question is uh so

798
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
why you bring this here do you

799
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,120
do you plan on asking for uh this to be

800
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,279
adopted as a working document

801
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,200
i would love for this to be adopted as a

802
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,600
working group document uh again i don't

803
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,279
really know the process behind that or

804
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,000
when it's appropriate to ask but yeah

805
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,480
well it's always appropriate and the

806
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,640
process is asking us then we ask the

807
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,679
group

808
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,960
give people two or three weeks to

809
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,880
comment on whether it's a good or not a

810
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,279
good idea and then

811
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,120
if they all agree then

812
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,039
then we ask you the serious questions do

813
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,559
you know that you're giving up change

814
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,399
control because the group has changed

815
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,880
control and then if you say yes then

816
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,200
yeah it's we adopt it well we just make

817
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,519
sure with the ideas that uh it's within

818
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,960
our scope but i don't think that's going

819
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,279
to be a problem

820
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,840
uh then yeah i would love to put out the

821
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,279
call for adoption

822
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,039
okay so we'll do that

823
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,399
after the oh after the itf week because

824
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,159
uh asking people for comments right now

825
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,200
is like

826
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,519
now they're concerned about the session

827
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,440
tomorrow

828
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,120
better when they get back

829
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,159
home or to work so once he publishes the

830
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,240
update we could ask for a review of the

831
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,559
update and whether we

832
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,760
whether it should be a working group

833
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,200
draft

834
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,640
we'd probably do that at the same time

835
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,519
right

836
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,679
two birds once done

837
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,120
sounds good

838
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,440
sounds like a plan

839
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,719
okay so

840
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,480
any other

841
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,760
questions comments

842
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,839
okay

843
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,239
right um

844
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,040
none of that so i'll see if i

845
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,119
manage to find the button that replaces

846
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,359
the deck rather than

847
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,359
closing the deck and opening another one

848
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,199
yeah i think i did so

849
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,960
time for acme integrations

850
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,879
i like this i'm here and you

851
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,918
life

852
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:50,879
yeah

853
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,159
ready

854
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,040
yeah

855
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,879
okay well uh this is rafat here um happy

856
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,160
to hear to be here in person finally so

857
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,240
unfortunately owen is not here so i'm

858
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,640
gonna be talking about this and we have

859
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,839
the team here

860
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,720
next slide please

861
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,040
so um

862
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,440
since that the

863
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,040
version

864
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,720
5 we did

865
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,839
mainly editorial changes so

866
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,880
aligned with the dns terminology

867
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,000
uh added some missing terminology

868
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,440
acronyms

869
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,480
and

870
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,920
just again using proper terminology all

871
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,160
over the document just to be consistent

872
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,680
so that's what we did

873
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
in that in that version

874
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,240
next slide

875
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,680
um some minor

876
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,720
uh edit editorial stuff still in in the

877
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,480
in the next version uh but otherwise um

878
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,760
we are as as authors i think we this

879
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,560
work this document is ready and we

880
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,480
should be going to a work group last

881
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,640
call in this one

882
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,799
and

883
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,920
that's what we're asking right now so

884
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,520
we want to get the thoughts of the

885
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,599

last uh presentation is the acme

902
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,520
subdomains

903
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,160
i've heard if you give me presentation

904
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,680
control i can do it from my my phone now

905
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,119
that's what i heard i don't know if it

906
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,839
really is true

907
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,680
you have to click on my name and it's

908
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,920
the third icon to the way that the

909
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,040
pop-up

910
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,079
i could only

911
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,280
try all the technology on the first date

912
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,359
because all the new features right right

913
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,359
yeah just to find your name define my

914
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,440
name and then you hover and then you go

915
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,839
to the far right

916
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,800
of the not my profile page

917
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,960
you

918
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,359
okay so i'm here to talk about the acme

919
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,359
subdomains document which was adopted

920
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,880
i think just before they can do it hold

921
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,359
on for me what i can do you can do it

922
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,440
yeah ooh look at that

923
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,200
oh all slots for requested media are

924
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,640
already taken what does that i don't

925
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,400
know all right well well yo we'll just

926
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,160
do next slide when i ask him to that's

927
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,800
the even higher tech version i have an

928
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,720
a.i

929
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,520
really a i that will actually change the

930
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,240
slides for me no evidence he's a real

931
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,920
person um

932
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,480
anyway okay so the document was actually

933
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,119
adopted i think just before the

934
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,880
last ietf

935
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,640
we split the document out of

936
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,160
integrations

937
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,400
and so we had to do a bunch of work on

938
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,720
it uh to make it you know flat showed

939
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,480
out as a real document

940
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,560
it was adopted um

941
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,680
next slide please yes

942
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,640
uh so uh again like the previous

943
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,680
document

944
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,079
um you know we fixed a bunch of the

945
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,079
terminology to be more correctly uh acme

946
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,920
um and uh

947
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,320
there was some you know some

948
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,839
some other terms in there that were a

949
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,520
little bit you know certificate

950
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,599
certificate authority such a

951
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,599
certification authority things like that

952
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,040
that were fixed

953
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,760
um and kind of the most interesting part

954
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
is that there was some criticism of that

955
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,320
some of the json content for some of the

956
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,920
order uh parts were were a bit confusing

957
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
they're a little bit contrived and so we

958
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,440
fixed that based upon some thing and

959
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,760
there's some text there to fix to

960
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,680
clarify the examples

961
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,399
next slide please

962
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,560
so there's the example

963
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,520
we had this domain name space which you

964
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,760
know kind of made sense at the time

965
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,800
um but

966
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
further reading it you know just sub

967
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,440
domains is true uh or not um this is

968
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,760
when you're asking for an authorization

969
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,680
about whether you want to do everything

970
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,200
below it or not

971
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,960
and again the same thing domain

972
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,560
namespace true because it became

973
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,720
subdomain just to make it really clear

974
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,560
there's not really a lot of it's really

975
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,880
it's pretty obvious i think how to do

976
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,960
subdomains just you know to write it

977
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,160
down and everyone has to agree and

978
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,480
that's really about it and next slide i

979
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,440
think that's the last one

980
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,319
rifat and i both work live in ottawa but

981
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,800
we only only talk when we're here at an

982
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,160
itf meeting

983
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,599
and uh owen is 12 hours ahead of us so

984
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,680
it's a real challenge um so we think

985
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,520
this document is probably also ready for

986
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,520
working group last call um it obviously

987
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,440
hasn't has much time in the working

988
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,760
group as a document but really you've

989
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,599
seen it from the very beginning

990
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,920
there it would make sense to me to

991
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,359
you know read them all together um there

992
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,040
and i'll just mention that there is a

993
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,359
document in lamps that will

994
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,119
that is now referenced by the previous

995
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,079
document that we'll get into rfc editor

996
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,800
q miss ref but that's not our our fault

997
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
we should do our

998
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,640
do our do our finish up our work here

999
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,839
that's about it

1000
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,800
thank you any questions

1001
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,160
anyone read the document

1002
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,400
oh good over there over there thank you

1003
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,680
good okay thank you very much

1004
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,079
okay that term brings us to the end of

1005
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,480
first slide and i guess the same thing

1006
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,520
is true

1007
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,359
that um yeah

1008
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,200
submit to zero three and then we'll do

1009
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,520
the working group last call probably do

1010
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,000
them together

1011
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,839
quite uh connected to each

1012
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,240
other um okay so um

1013
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,359
now let's get back to the share slides

1014
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,079
and then i have to go

1015
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,560
all the way here right

1016
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,520
so um we got to the um any other

1017
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,040
business part with plenty of time

1018
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,960
um

1019
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,839
can just mention that um

1020
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,280
assuming those working group last calls

1021
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
finished successfully will be totally

1022
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,200
out of work unless we also adopt an ari

1023
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,439
so

1024
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,480
depending on how that turns out um

1025
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,760
