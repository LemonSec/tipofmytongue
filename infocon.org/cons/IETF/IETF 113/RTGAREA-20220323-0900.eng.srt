56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,760
have seen the noteworth slide we're

57

familiar with it please keep in mind

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,480
that this is not just about intellectual

59
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,159
property and contributions it's about

60
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,440
behavior

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,480
as well

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,120
there are links to a number of

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,799
bcps down there

64
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,159
and we chose to

65
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,799
highlight a couple of the things from um

66
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,799
rc7154

67
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,239
about

68
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,680
behavior

69
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
treat people respect

70
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,840
speak slowly at the mic keep in mind

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,519
that there are people from all around

72
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,280
the world they speak different languages

73
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,000
this is about engineering let's keep the

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,720
the

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,560
discussions technical

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
to try and find what the best solution

77
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,879
for the internet is this should

78
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,319
be something that we all keep in mind

79
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,799
not just when speaking at the mic

80
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,480
but we're interacting with others at the

81
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
meetings through the

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,759

great so um

393
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,120
besides the huge change of course of ads

394
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
the area hasn't changed a lot more we

395
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,399
don't haven't opened or closed any

396
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,000
working groups or recharge or anything

397
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
in the last year or since last meeting

398
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,639
and we don't have any new chairs

399
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,560
we have two

400
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,360
buffs that have been approved

401
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,839
one is called msr-6 for

402
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,639
multicast

403
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,240
segment routing

404
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,079
uh with ipv6

405
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,399
uh there's a buff that we approved but

406
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,480
we haven't held it yet

407
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
we have been working with the proponents

408
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
to

409
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,920
um get them ready we're probably going

410
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,759
to have a

411
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,279
interim buff

412
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,199
sometime before ietf 114.

413
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,560
um

414
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
so please look out for that

415
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,519
we

416
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,600
will try to find a time or probably a

417
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,079
couple of times so that we can have

418
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,039
the maximum participation possible

419
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,240
johnny want to say something about ken

420
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,108
you had the candle

421
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:21,158
[Music]

422
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,319
wasn't targeted towards creating a

423
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,799
working group um i think a lot of you

424
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,400
were there

425
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,440
um

426
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,640
there was a

427
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,280
great deal of energy i thought at the

428
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,520
the buff a lot of

429
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,240
good back and forth with the proponents

430
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
um

431
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,520
i'm not really gonna try to summarize

432
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,000
technical outcomes um

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
because that's what the slide sets and

434
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,559
so on are for um

435
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,200
but i think

436
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
it's

437
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,520
probably the the big takeaway is there

438
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,559
was a lot of um

439
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,880
there was a lot of energy around it uh

440
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,840
there

441
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,799
was

442
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,280
good feedback to the components that um

443
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,120
probably the single

444
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,240
most

445
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,360
most uh repeated comment was

446
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
uh

447
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,120
please don't fix your problem by shoving

448
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,880
state into the network of course that

449
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,200
might just be me um engaging a little

450
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
confirmation bias too

451
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,960
or

452
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,559
i should say pushing state into the

453
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,840
underlay which is a different thing

454
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,080
and

455
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,840
subsequent conversation is going to take

456
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,799
place on the doncast mailing list

457
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,919
uh

458
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,640
anything to add

459
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,640
from any of the other ideas or people

460
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,120
who are there

461
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,039
anyway i do encourage people to get on

462
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,960
the mailing list and engage in the

463
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
conversation because i think that

464
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,320
this will be a

465
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,200
continuing topic

466
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,039

drafts the last call

532
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,320
draft and early review

533
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,039
to the routing area work and we are also

534
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,000
providing the review for some related

535
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
working other area for example

536
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,400
obs

537
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,799
and if you are interested you understand

538
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,919
us please turn the chat to check the

539
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,360
wiki page

540
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,158
and next please

541
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,480
so here are some statistics

542
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,039
from the

543
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,760
summary of statistics since the last

544
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,120
ietf

545
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,880
and we have uh theoretically

546
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,559
updated this

547
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,679
figures

548
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,840
from 2020 and we have now more than 100

549
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,280
early review and last call review so far

550
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,840
and from last itf in november we have

551
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,400
succeeded in three early reviews and the

552
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,880
13 last call reviews

553
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,440
so this is uh basically in normal

554
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,000
average uh from only the numbers of

555
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,520
review request

556
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,919
and we also in the right hand figure we

557
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
have the the

558
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,320
distribution of the review request for

559
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,640
different working groups and the top

560
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,440
three would be idr best and rsr

561
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,720
and next page please

562
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,159
so finally yeah this is the

563
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,720
distribution or the percentage of the

564
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,960
result because each of the review

565
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,159
results would be shared with

566
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,640
working group chairs and

567
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,480
feedback to the corresponding working

568
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,440
groups

569
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
and basically for

570
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,640
rtg area for rotting every drop so we

571
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,320
are having

572
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,760
around 1 100 of that and basically we

573
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,240
have one third of them ready have nets

574
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,480
or have some issues

575
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,280
only a few of them label as not ready

576
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,679
and request further work

577
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,919
and the right hand will list all the non

578
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,919
uh

579
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,980
[Laughter]

580
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,919

last call 2 is g4 and we have about 14

615
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,240
drafts like in different stages of

616
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,400
discussion you know adoption and ideas

forthcoming and so on so this is the

618
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,360
amount of activity

619
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,279
um next one please

620
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,880

we have for our work for beer going on

623
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,159
you know two three different solutions

624
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,960
with multiple drafts good discussions uh

625
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,120
stuff kind of converge last issues being

626
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,600
resolved to get the stuff adopted

627
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,559
uh the tea work the brte work is kind of

628
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,200
um finished the stuff is being published

629
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,080
a lot of spec coming out there

630
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,480
um

631
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
[Music]

632
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,760
from jeffrey's site and some other

633
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,000
authors multicast as a service is going

634
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,960
on

635
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,720
we had uh pretty rough going by the dn

636
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,840
convergence on how to carry beer in ipv6

637
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,360
so that's done

638
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,200
uh there is a bunch of interesting

639
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,760
proposals on oam and work going on the

640
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
no aim so those are kind of the notable

641
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,640
things

642
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
stuff i didn't put up here so we're

643
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,039
seeing um more and more adoption we're

644
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,440
seeing some new silicon and we're seeing

645
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,159
a full p4 implementation

646
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,919
a whole of giant and some of commercial

647
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,320
forks are getting onto a beer backbone

648
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,679
the traditional motor because it's being

649
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,200
hooked up to that so there's a lot of

650
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
activity there

651
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,600
um next one i think that's it

652
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,279
yeah thanks we're brewing here

653
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,360
if there are no questions i'm kind of

654
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,279
done

655
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,760
no thanks tony go ahead mike

656
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,760
thanks

657
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,000
yeah so uh let me just give a brief

658
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,279
pim summary um

659
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:28,960
the

660
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,480
work that is probably the most

661
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,080
interesting to

662
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,799
is there a question already

663
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,120
from darren

664
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,240
nope

665
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,440
is work that's related to sigmund

666
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,640
routing and point to multiple point work

667
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,080
pim as a reminder is protocols for ip

668
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,480
multicast and not specific to protocol

669
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,799
independent multicast and so

670
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,000
a couple years ago almost um

671
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,840
in working with the spring

672
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,760
chairs and the working group we've taken

673
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,559
over the responsibility of

674
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,960
segment routing and point to multiplayer

675
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,840
work

676
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,960
and

677
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,120
we've just had an informal agreement

678
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,919
with spring to address such

679
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,600
proposals

680
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,760
and we are in the process of making it

681
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,840
official in our charter we are waiting

682
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,559
on a few things um before

683
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,399
implementing it but basically what we'll

684
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,080
add is something like what we have here

685
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,760
is that is to

686
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,399
develop a point-to-multi-point protocols

687
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,559
including

688
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,559
srsrv6 p2mp work in agreement with

689
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,600
spring this may also require

690
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,760
a point-to-multipoint protocols as

691
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
requested from other working groups

692
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,919
which i'll get to that last point in a

693
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:44,960
minute

694
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,000
so since then we have adopted a couple

695
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,600
drafts

696
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,480
in this area

697
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,799
this segment routing point to multipoint

698
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,399
work

699
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,200
creates a policy to instantiate a point

700
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
to multi-point tree by stitching replica

701
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,440
replication segments together

702
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,279
and the replication

703
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,480
segment itself is is defined in spring

704
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,399
so we're doing the

705
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,120
p2mp policy

706
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,640
in pym

707
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,880
uh there is a lot of related work that's

708
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,000
happening in other working groups and

709
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,320
i'll have to say it seems to be working

710
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,039
pretty well i

711
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,600
really appreciate uh for instance idr

712
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,120
just recently uh sue uh reaching out to

713
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,200
us and other working groups just to let

714
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,559
us know that this is going on in their

715
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,240
working group and

716
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,880
how we wanted to handle it and um

717
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,039
so that first draft you see there is

718
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,480
being is

719
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,640
is modifying bgpls and so it's being

720
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
handled in idr

721
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,279
uh another related draft is being worked

722
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,159
on in pce um since it's specifying

723
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,880
extensions to psap

724
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,120
and something similar and best as well

725
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,039
so this whole area

726
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,919
in the past has been somewhat confusing

727
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,679
of who handles what

728
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,520
it seems like we've

729
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,840
kind of come to an agreement of what we

730
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
will and will not do

731
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
i think for pim

732
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,960
uh we're taking on the um sr related

733
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,120
work in relation and agreeing with

734
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,640
spring and as far as these other working

735
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,840
groups are concerned we'll just

736
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
uh get involved as they request us to

737
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,240
get involved and they seem to be wanting

738
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,679
to handle their own point to multi-point

739
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,600
work in their own in their own working

740
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
groups

741
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,399
um next slide and last slide so there's

742
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,120
there's other work as well that's uh

743
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,640
somewhat interesting of course there's

744
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,799
the yang drafts that we've

745
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,559
been working on

746
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,679
but there are also some dr improvement

747
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,760
related drafts

748
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,840
in pim

749
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,279
make the dr election

750
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,120
less likely for packet loss and to make

751
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,840
that dr election more sticky so that

752
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,600
like when a new

753
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,159
dr that has a higher priority comes into

754
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,720
the network uh it doesn't immediately

755
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,399
become the ddr but the the other one it

756
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,399
remains as the dr

757
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,600
um

758
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,960
and so uh and a new backup designated

759
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,039
router role which is also being

760
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,320
proposed

761
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,120
that we've adopted

762
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,279
which will immediately take over without

763
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,200
much packet loss

764
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,760
so we we have these two drafts that do

765
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
similar things just kind of a different

766
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,559
approach and we're trying to decide

767
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,960
whether we progress them further

768
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,039
converge them and we'll be talking about

769
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,840
this on thursday when we meet

770
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
and then just some other

771
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,399
as maybe some interesting work that you

772
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,559
may find interesting is there are some

773
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,880
new drafts that are being proposed such

774
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,760
as pim light which there may be some

775
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,320
instances where there's some

776
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,640
interfaces that

777
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,120
don't want to have the overhead of a pim

778
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
neighbor relationship but still want to

779
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,840
accept joins prunes and asserts

780
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,760
um and so there's that draft that's

781
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,200
being proposed and it'll be presented

782
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,679
this week and there's also um

783
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,240
mrh multicast writing header related

784
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,799
type of presentations

785
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,320
that are

786
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,080
gonna are that are proposed if we have

787
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,840
time to be presented as well in pim so

788
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,440
come join us on thursday if you can

789
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,440
thanks

790
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,120
thanks mikey

791
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,919
okay

792
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,440
okay working

793
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,519
hey hello so this is dr speaking here

794
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,840
i'm going to make a quick update on the

795
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
lsvr working group

796
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,000
so we have our session tomorrow

797
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
at 10 o'clock so the agenda what i

798
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,840
prepared in a couple of slides is like

799
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,279
you know first to explain where we are

800
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,440
with the lsvr and the time schedule

801
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,519
quick uh understanding of what it

802
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,559
actually is

803
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,399
and then we're gonna cover the uh the

804
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,080
next steps of the working group itself

805
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,199
so next slide please

806
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,080
so we started our work so we got like

807
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,519
created around idf 101 so that's about

808
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,399
like

809
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,919
four years ago i guess

810
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,919
which is quite a long time and then we

811
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,679
were given a shock you know to be in

812
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,919
existence and to work upon upon our

813
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,240
deliverables for about like two years

814
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,399
three years now we felt a little bit

815
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,919
there and we're still working on this

816
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,039
thing now

817
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,440
now the good thing is that at least

818
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,760
right now we have

819
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,000
a protocol spec which is considered to

820
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,240
be ready for iesg it went through a few

821
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,440
cycles

822
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,880
through the routing directory that we've

823
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,200
used in the working group it went to you

824
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,159
know isg already they set it back

825
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,720
and now we also have confidence so

826
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,760
next slide please

827
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
so here uh

828
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,240
so so the three deliverables what we had

829
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,000
to

830
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,640
complete at the end of this working

831
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
group would be an applicability

832
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,159
applicability statement the ns3r spec

833
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,039
and the description of how you know each

834
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,559
link state vector actually looks like

835
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,560
how the transport actually works so as i

836
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,079
mentioned we consider this you know

837
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,480
really now and the work we have is ready

838
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,800
to be sent towards iesg at this point in

839
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,760
time

840
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,119
another part of the deliverable of

841
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,960
course is also we need to manage this

842
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,199
technology we need to have like a young

843
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,839
specification for that that is spending

844
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,719
uh

845
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,320
up on further idr work on bgp because

846
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,760
the lsvr you know based upon bgp short

847
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,879
forwarding

848
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,520
is you know

849
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,918
leaning a lot upon the bgp technology on

850
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,800
bgpls more specifically

851
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,760
so next slide please

852
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,359
so if you look into the different

853
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,800
components

854
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,719
so we can actually carve them up into

855
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,800
four different uh sections here so we

856
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
first look at the bottom one it's like

857
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,040
each router uh it will actually have

858
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,399
like link states that needs to be

859
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,359
harvested yeah and initially we

860
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,680
were looking into ltp

861
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,520
version one for that but what we

862
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,760
discovered is that there may be no

863
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,599
there's not enough space in an llpp

864
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,040
packet itself to describe and to

865
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,720
exchange all the protocol information

866
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,760
required

867
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,480
so we developed like uh like a

868
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,160
first lucky requirement of like you know

869
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,079
what would be necessary for that and

870
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,240
then we developed l3dl

871
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,839
and we also worked with them together

872
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,320
with the ieee and into you know

873
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,359
enhancing led we crafted as a result of

874
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,920
that ldpv2 actually was created from

875
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,800
that

876
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,280
now once we have the listed information

877
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,839
of a router it needs to be encoded into

878
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,800
some sort of a common understanding of

879
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
and that actually needs to be shared you

880
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,480
know between all different routers

881
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,800
within a particular area and that is

882
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,079
done by you know rather insane

883
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,720
distribution and that is where each pspf

884
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,200
comes into place in the pgp technology

885
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,040
and on top of that we also are using

886
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,119
like spf for the routing table

887
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,839
calculation and that is

888
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,960
where uh you know beach dspf deviates

889
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,320
you know

890
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,200
from what traditional bgp is doing

891
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,359
so here you can see also on the top left

892
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,240
hand side so lsvr is using you know for

893
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,000
cultivating routes like your teaching

894
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,920
spf that is what describes actually our

895
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,320
work in our main specification so next

896
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,800
slide please

897
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,920
so initially you know when we were

898
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,760
looking into different kind of solutions

899
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,599
we selected you know a pgp based

900
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,920
solution why is because

901
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,599
you know bgp is really you know is a

902
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,440
very well known protocol it is stable it

903
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,599
scares you know scales a lot it's very

904
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,200
you know many people actually know

905
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,880
there's reliable transport it has

906
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,560
guaranteed you know deliveries all you

907
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,040
know fancy and good things the downside

908
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,119
of what pgp is

909
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,280
is that this you know it uses like part

910
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,800
hunting and it's a distance detector

911
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,040
protocol itself which is maybe not the

912
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,160
most optimal in at that point in time

913
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,320
for describing a topological database

914
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,480
within the network itself so for that we

915
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,440
used like you know we decided to go for

916
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,880
php

917
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,320
ls on that one

918
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,240
and change the way

919
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,839
it calculates the routes and how it

920
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,760
distributes links and information

921
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,119
between different

922
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,800
nodes in the network

923
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,160
so

924
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,879
next slide please

925
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,920
yeah so

926
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,640
you know short so lsvr is not technology

927
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,400
which you know intends to be used for

928
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,560
like small networks this is really for

929
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,040
you know massive scale data centers

930
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,720
and this you know very well tuned for

931
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,720
that so we're gonna go to the next one

932
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,079
so here we have like you know an

933
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,520
interesting

934
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,280
flight here so this is something that

935
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,720
got

936
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,280
so the pdf looks a bit different from

937
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,839
the powerpoint itself so some graphs

938
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,599
actually were changing so what you

939
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,040
normally would be seeing here is like

940
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,880
each of these routers it's like a small

941
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,800
puzzle piece you know associated with it

942
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,560
and the puzzle piece actually describes

943
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,839
like you know who am i who are my

944
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:56,880
neighbors and what its customer

945
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,720
neighbors together with some other link

946
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,880
properties associated with it

947
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,640
just a typical graph what you would see

948
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,880
with the classical link state routing

949
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,119
protocol itself but in this case these

950
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,880
pieces of the puzzle are exchanged by

951
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,720
using your php

952
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,760
ls and more specifically by the pgpspf

953
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,520
variant

954
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,200
and we also have like a new software for

955
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,800
that we just like savvy

956
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,839
so the next slide please

957
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,240
so from the peering models so

958
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
what we are using for this is something

959
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,640
reasonably simple well known again and

960
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,040
we will be using actually we are using

961
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,200
like route reflector technologies for

962
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,240
for this

963
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,160
uh some people may also want to call it

964
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,599
like a controller because there may be

965
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,040
more things you want to do with it you

966
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,760
know

967
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,839
you know and be a bit more smart on how

968
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,680
you actually use topology harvester

969
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,760
through the bgp spf

970
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,839
but in essence use like a hierarchy of

971
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,119
output vectors

972
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,119
and they're not necessarily you know

973
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,240
probably going to be like directly

974
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,520
connected to each other but they don't

975
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,160
have to be so if you pre-load you know

976
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,000
information they don't really have to be

977
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,680
directly connected so next slide

978
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,800
so what we have changed with bgp spf so

979
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,640
this is the base spec of lsvr

980
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,240
is uh so in the classical part of the

981
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,079
algorithm you have like the two phases

982
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,680
like phase one and we still playing on

983
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,200
the router so first you get like you're

984
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,680
not using you're out this thing and then

985
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,359
you have a calculation of degree of

986
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,040
preference with each of these particular

987
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,040
entries then you select the best one out

988
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,880
of them and then you actually forward

989
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,480
those best routes you know to the rest

990
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,320
of your neighbors

991
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,640
so what is done in lsvr is slightly

992
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,599
different

993
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,000
and then we follow what spf actually is

994
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,839
doing so each route in this case you

995
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,000
know each piece of the puzzle here will

996
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,640
have like a unique nlri the other will

997
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,960
get it it will you know

998
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,760
put it into its database itself and it

999
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,520
can actually directly forward it towards

1000
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,040
you know all other others and all other

1001
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,119
neighbors you know as such and then it

1002
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,800
can actually do the right calculation

1003
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,640
the best part selection and after that

1004
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,960
so that's quite quite a big win from uh

1005
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,319
from a

1006
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,040
convergence perspective in big networks

1007
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,359
so next slide please

1008
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,280
almost there

1009
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,440
so there are some benefits here for

1010
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,400
using bgp spf uh compared to classical

1011
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
bgps because we have used the you know

1012
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,599
the spf

1013
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,960
technology here which means you don't

1014
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,319
really have to wait upon selecting the

1015
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,800
best part we can forward

1016
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,720
the nris directly and then do the

1017
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,440
calculation afterwards and we also have

1018
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,280
because we have you know the bgpls

1019
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,440
encoding itself we will get like at the

1020
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,640
end like a full topological you know

1021
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,480
information of the complete network

1022
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,920
itself

1023
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,160
and

1024
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,400
and also if something actually happens

1025
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,880
in the network we only will communicate

1026
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,480
the change in the network without

1027
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
actually having to resend like all of

1028
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,960
the routes routers which were impacted

1029
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,920
by that particular change

1030
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,640
so next slide

1031
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,040
so this is the last one here so where

1032
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,280
are we right now so we have like you

1033
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,319
know our base pack you know hp spf 16

1034
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,240
was last updated with the yana code

1035
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,319
points which were requested

1036
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,160
we actually have like you know almost

1037
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,359
finished

1038
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,880
draft also of the l3dl work now this

1039
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,359
part of work has not been

1040
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,760
fully in line with what we were short of

1041
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
to do so that is something we will have

1042
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,440
to change before we can progress and

1043
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,000
also onwards towards the iesg so our

1044
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,760
next step actually is you know first you

1045
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,440
know we consider that the key rules

1046
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,079
actually are completed right now so the

1047
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,560
base pack will be sent up towards the

1048
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,480
ift you know once

1049
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,240
the shepherd actually finds the time for

1050
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,200
that

1051
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,960
and then next you know we have to go

1052
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,000
through

1053
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,240
uh a resharper to include to work l3dl

1054
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,400
as a formal part of the working group

1055
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,000
itself so that we can actually you know

1056
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,880
formally you know progress this and as

1057
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,680
as a as a formal on a word item itself

1058
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,640
even though it actually has been

1059
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,720
progressed in you know where we are

1060
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,240
then of course also we still need to

1061
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,720
manage this whole technology itself so

1062
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,240
we need to have a young specification

1063
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,880
upon that it is in the works uh but it

1064
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,280
is waiting on an idr for the bgps

1065
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,560
set of uh

1066
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,720
so that is it actually if no questions

1067
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,480
then we can move to the next one

1068
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,960
thanks hunter

1069
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,960
jeff

1070
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,079
do you want to come up here okay

1071
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,599
a quick update for you

1072
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,200
the base pack is still in reviews and i

1073
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,280
would like to specifically thank you

1074
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,680
alvaro for all the work been really huge

1075
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,440
amount of work done

1076
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,920
between authors and albert it's really

1077
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,319
progressing well so we expect

1078
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,319
further progress by next atf

1079
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,800
applicability statement we are waiting

1080
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,280
for alberto review

1081
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,880
yank model

1082
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,200
uh caught up with the latest changes to

1083
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,720
the base pack so

1084
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,240
working room plus call in progress we

1085
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,040
expect to finish it after this atf

1086
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,200
key value registry as well in working

1087
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,800
with last call and will be finished

1088
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,560
after the atf

1089
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,640
how to avpn there's good progress

1090
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,720
there's already implementation of it

1091
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,359
segment routing uh it's in progress

1092
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,280
normal working

1093
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,079
process and we plan to

1094
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,079
adopt it as a working group document

1095
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,079
after this atf

1096
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,640
and multicast there's no really progress

1097
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,480
we don't see a lot of traction in the

1098
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,119
industry so for time being it just you

1099
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,920
know back-end

1100
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,319
questions

1101
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,400
we are still working on the second

1102
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,760
implementation with open source

1103
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,920
community there have been some issues

1104
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,240
about gpl with towards spatial licensing

1105
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,399
we are trying to resolve this

1106
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,680
thank you

1107
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,040
hello hi everyone this is daniela

1108
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,240
reporting

1109
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,160
on updates

1110
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,240
regarding the second working group

1111
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,119
actually

1112
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,200
i would say that 90 percent of the work

1113
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,880
that we are doing in c camp in these

1114
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,800
days is related to

1115
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,560
young models here

1116
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,880
we decided to provide an upgrade and

1117
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,640
update

1118
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,839
split

1119
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,119
by by technology so as you can see here

1120
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,440
the three main technologies we are

1121
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,400
working on in these days are optical

1122
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,720
optical networks

1123
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,359
where we do wavelength

1124
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,040
based switching otn networks which is

1125
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,839
the

1126
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,880
so-called electrical layer of the

1127
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,359
optical networks where we have time

1128
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,440
division multiplexing and microwave

1129
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,280
microwave networks

1130
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,880
uh so

1131
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,680
the approach that we

1132
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,119
we used and we are still using uh

1133
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,319
in

1134
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,160
defining young models for these

1135
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,440
different types of networks is to start

1136
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,240
with

1137
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,720
what we call the the types as you can

1138
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
see here we have the layer zero types of

1139
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,520
optical network and layer one types for

1140
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,079
uh for routine networks basically this

1141
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:22,720
is

1142
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,880
a common data type

1143
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,400
uh which needs to be imported uh

1144
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,400
for uh for double zone for flexi grid

1145
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,440
in layer zero and four of rotian in

1146
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,599
layer one

1147
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,640
uh

1148
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,119
we are actually working on on a beast

1149
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,079
for the for player zero for layer zero

1150
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,880
type to include the transformation

1151
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,280
transponders and impairment awareness so

1152
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,800
as you as you can see are also in the

1153
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,160
intellect mallet so we did pretty

1154
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,280
a lot of work in the impairment free

1155
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,800
type of networking

1156
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,800
basically we assume that

1157
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,079
reachability is the only issue when

1158
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,800
connecting uh when connecting devices in

1159
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,720
this type of approach we define the

1160
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,400
topology models

1161
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,800
this is what we call a double zone or

1162
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,160
flexigrid

1163
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,520
double zone is a

1164
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,920
optical network with a fixed grid each

1165
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,720
channel as a fixed lead for this type of

1166
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,359
network so we have defined topology and

1167
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,839
panel models we did the same for

1168
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,640
flexible grid type of networks where

1169
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,440
basically the the grid is is not

1170
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,880
fixed and it's possible to

1171
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,400
define a channel

1172
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,580
with the

1173
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,880
[Music]

1174
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,720
configurable

1175
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,680
frequency and the channel

1176
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,680
width

1177
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,400
now we are moving towards the next step

1178
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,839
uh the one abolded which is the optical

1179
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,319
impairments topology this is something

1180
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,880
that will allow for better

1181
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,960
interoperability between

1182
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,480
different uh

1183
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,319
different vendors taking into

1184
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,359
consideration uh our

1185
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,000
optical impairments awareness

1186
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,359
in networking

1187
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,960
it's something that is making things

1188
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,000
absolutely more complex but will finally

1189
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,839
break uh the fact that most of the

1190
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,359
networks come from from a single vendor

1191
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,160
uh

1192
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,520
similar work is done uh in innotiana

1193
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,480
where likely we don't have to deal with

1194
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,599
uh

1195
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,839
optical impairments because everything

1196
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,480
is electrical we have the layer one

1197
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,800
types topology tunnel model and

1198
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,920
something

1199
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,960
which we are starting to work right now

1200
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,800
this is a draft that we recently adopted

1201
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,119
which is audience slicing

1202
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,680
we are discussing about the possibility

1203
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,078
to do

1204
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,559
network slicing at the lower layers so

1205
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,040
lower than the packet switching

1206
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,520
uh there is

1207
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,079
quite some discussion over there because

1208
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,200
someone believes that we just need to

1209
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,920
build an applicability statement

1210
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,480
on how to use the end the networks for

1211
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,720
network slicing someone some others

1212
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,640
believe that

1213
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,480
otiana deserve its own slicing methods

1214
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,119
here obviously a lot of alignment with

1215
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,839
these is is needed because they are the

1216
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,119
owners of our network slicing and i mean

1217
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,640
most of the discussions are done in

1218
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,160
conjunction with

1219
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,200
with them so we believe that the

1220
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,160
alignment is there

1221
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,359
for microwave we we've been working on

1222
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,760
the modeling of radio links and we are

1223
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,520
now uh

1224
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,480
working as working group on

1225
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,000
the topology

1226
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,559
next please

1227
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,200
again young models so we are not just

1228
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,680
working on topologies and tunnels but

1229
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,040
also services we define the layer one uh

1230
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,480
service model

1231
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,000
probably now uh

1232
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,720
we are not considerate yet but maybe

1233
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,800
with some alignment with the ops working

1234
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,960
group might might be needed here since

1235
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,920
they

1236
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,200
they own the layer 2 and m layer 3 and m

1237
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,839
models this is this is something we need

1238
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,839
we need to

1239
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,319
consider client signals and topologies

1240
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,200
again the the transport network is is

1241
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,760
used to carry uh

1242
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,680
upper upper layer type type of services

1243
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,559
here is where we are discussing uh how

1244
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,960
the client signals are

1245
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,760
carried and matched over uh

1246
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,319
lower layer topologies and then network

1247
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:55,119
inventory uh here probably we need some

1248
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,040
alignment uh with the

1249
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,200
with other working groups so basically

1250
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,079
we have this is a new uh individual

1251
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,480
draft that has been recently proposed in

1252
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,760
ccamp they they are working on the uh

1253
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,319
data model for network artery inventory

1254
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,920
this is pretty much optical

1255
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,040
related but

1256
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,520
i i would say that some

1257
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,040
let me say non-technology-specific work

1258
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,040
is is needed here so

1259
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,280
here we are seeking for your advice on

1260
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,319
uh

1261
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,079
which working group we

1262
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,880
need to align with

1263
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,200
next please

1264
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,720
uh other topics these are the few known

1265
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,920
young

1266
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,400
related topics the applicability of

1267
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,839
gmpls to otn networks beyond 100

1268
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,359
gigabits

1269
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,480
uh

1270
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,559
how to use uh

1271
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,400
all the young models are defined by the

1272
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,839
itf uh

1273
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:02,800
on the

1274
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,040
northbound interface of another

1275
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,680
controller of an sdn controller lmp lmp

1276
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,000
is the protocol uh owned by camp uh for

1277
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,920
for link management we have some

1278
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,960
extensions for lmp there

1279
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,280
and then some new york new work on

1280
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,520
the usage of optical networks that will

1281
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,240
interconnect

1282
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,839
data centers

1283
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,319
and cloud

1284
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,800
in the next slides

1285
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,800
we have a very short example of the two

1286
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,160
uh let me say topics where uh where uh

1287
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,920
where alignment with other working

1288
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
groups is uh

1289
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,640
is being done or is needed

1290
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,880
as i mentioned before otian slicing is

1291
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,079
the first one

1292
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,480
where we we already have alignment with

1293
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,000
that is ongoing

1294
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,559
as you can see on the right that's the

1295
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,119
architecture defined uh by the t by the

1296
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,720
tis working group

1297
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,839
the otn slice controller is is being

1298
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:08,640
added with several options where the

1299
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,839
dotn

1300
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,480
uh slice controller is directly

1301
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,960
connected directly controlled

1302
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,559
by the end-to-end orchestrator the

1303
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,839
end-to-end slice controller in option 3

1304
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,119
by the itf network slice controller in

1305
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,440
in option 2 or

1306
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,640
let me say bypassed in

1307
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,319
option 1.

1308
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,040
next please

1309
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,400
here uh i stole uh a slide from the

1310
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,040
presentation that uh

1311
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,640
the

1312
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,480
team working on network inventor is

1313
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,680
going to

1314
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,160
provide the next next friday during the

1315
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,680
second session

1316
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,680
and this is uh

1317
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,280
basically to

1318
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,640
highlight

1319
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,559
the the the question that we are asking

1320
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,079
ourselves is is here uh

1321
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,599
is there some

1322
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,880
generic

1323
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,359
work that needs to be done somewhere

1324
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,000
else and then in c-camp we need to

1325
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,990
augment it

1326
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,069
[Music]

1327
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,480
to to be technology specific to be

1328
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,400
optical specific

1329
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,880
this is again an an open question

1330
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,400
next slide the last one

1331
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,319
milestone to be updated we are working

1332
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,280
on that

1333
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,559
um

1334
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,319
my students were

1335
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,800
pretty uh outdated

1336
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,359
we will present our proposal

1337
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,640
to the working group on uh on friday and

1338
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,440
uh john expected to receive it

1339
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,640
for approval immediately after

1340
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,759
that's it from our side

1341
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,400
thank you daniela

1342
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,280
um

1343
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,680
we're gonna go over to tees

1344
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,440
hi uh is my audio coming through

1345
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,520
okay

1346
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,319
um my name is pawan veera my co-chair

1347
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,240
the traffic engineering architecture and

1348
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,839
signaling working group along with lou

1349
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:10,960
burger

1350
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,480
luis contreras is our working group

1351
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,559
secretary we also have a distinguished

1352
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,400
tech advisor in adrian farrell who keeps

1353
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,839
us honest from

1354
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,040
time to time

1355
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,000
uh

1356
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,280
for those of you who don't know what

1357
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,200
peace working group does i would let you

1358
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,400
go through

1359
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,800
slides two three and four at your own

1360
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,040
pace and reach out to the teased chairs

1361
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,559
if there are any questions for now let's

1362
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,960
just jump to slide five that covers the

1363
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,720
ongoing activities in the working group

1364
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,520
okay um so we currently have about 22

1365
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,559
working group documents um

1366
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,079
given that we spend a lot of time

1367
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,000
discussing architectures it shouldn't be

1368
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,079
a surprise that there's a lot of te

1369
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,319
specific data modeling work that gets

1370
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,480
done in the working group there are

1371
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,160
weekly open design meetings that are

1372
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,400
happening for some of these these are

1373
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,799
primarily driven by the authors of

1374
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,880
the various modeling drafts and are open

1375
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,200
to all so do check those meetings out if

1376
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,119
there's anything here of interest to you

1377
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,040
most of these modeling efforts are

1378
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,640
nearing completion so it would be great

1379
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,599
to get some thorough reviews in

1380
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,760
rfc 3272

1381
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,319
it's an itf classic discusses

1382
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,000
the principles of internet traffic

1383
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,760
engineering the only problem is that it

1384
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,240
was published two decades back and is uh

1385
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,480
tad outdated rather more than a tad

1386
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,520
outdated uh we revisited the documentary

1387
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,200
and

1388
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,880
it was rewritten to make it more

1389
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,280
relevant to the current times

1390
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,440
the editor has just told us that it's

1391
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,200
ready for working up last call uh

1392
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,720
hopefully this will last for the next

1393
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,599
two decades so uh again seeking thorough

1394
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,280
reviews for that document

1395
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,839
uh actn

1396
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,680
which stands for abstraction and control

1397
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,720
of t networks it's an umbrella term for

1398
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,799
a set of management and control

1399
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,799
functions used to operate one or more t

1400
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,079
networks

1401
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,079
these functions are typically used to

1402
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,559
construct virtual networks that are then

1403
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,720
presented to the customers the framework

1404
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,280
for this was published a few years back

1405
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,359
i think it was in 2018 we are now

1406
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,720
looking at how a ctn can apply to

1407
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,359
areas like packet optical integration

1408
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,000
and network slicing

1409
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,760
enhanced vpn

1410
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,119
it's another framework that is in the

1411
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,400
works that caters to enhanced

1412
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,160
connectivity services

1413
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,680
there is a fair bit of discussion in the

1414
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,079
working group about its applicability to

1415
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,559
network slicing and how it can be used

1416
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,000
to create

1417
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,760
the infrastructure to

1418
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,880
pin a network slicing service

1419
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,520
that's enhanced vpn then we have this

1420
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,280
topic of network slicing itself which

1421
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,400
has been hogging a majority of their

1422
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,680
time and tease working group sessions

1423
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,400
for the past couple of years we have a

1424
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,559
working group adopted framework document

1425
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,960
for what we refer to as ietf network

1426
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,319
slices

1427
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,400
we also have a working group adopted

1428
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,359
young model draft that discusses how

1429
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,000
an itf slice service can be requested

1430
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,319
um we also have various solution

1431
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,839
specific documents that are being

1432
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,559
thoroughly uh debated and discussed so

1433
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,240
we do understand that there are a fair

1434
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,760
number of network slicing related

1435
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,640
documents that are being presented and

1436
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,240
being pursued in other working groups in

1437
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,760
the routing area

1438
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,359
we would leave it to the other working

1439
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,799
groups to decide how they would want to

1440
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,880
proceed with those but if there are any

1441
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,319
questions or concerns related

1442
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,799
terminology or any concerns with respect

1443
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:27,920
to the framework or solution

1444
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,359
architectures

1445
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,880
please do reach out to the tease chairs

1446
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,520
or send an email to the piece list and

1447
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,920
we'll have those looked into

1448
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,839
the working group is also working on a

1449
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,400
few gm plus basic items like

1450
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,240
think that there's a protocol extensions

1451
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,839
document for shared mesh production that

1452
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,680
is with isg and then we have a working

1453
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,000
group adopter document that talks about

1454
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,920
interworking of

1455
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,440
distributed gm plus control and

1456
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,440
centralized controller systems

1457
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,960
um so that's what we're currently

1458
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,200
working on um our working your sessions

1459
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,720
are stated for today we have two

1460
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,280
back-to-back sessions uh do come join us

1461
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,720
if any of these topics interest you

1462
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,839
any questions

1463
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,920
okay thank you paul

1464
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,880
and update for the routine working group

1465
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,440
next slide please

1466
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,160
uh to remind you we were chartered to

1467
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,920
work on some

1468
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,720
work that doesn't have other hum in atf

1469
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,119
such as uh

1470
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,440
young models for

1471
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,440
driving protocols that don't

1472
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,040
have working groups

1473
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,119
already or not yet

1474
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,240
as well as say

1475
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,160
most importantly bringing new work that

1476
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,400
could potentially be dispatched into

1477
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,720
other areas and other working groups so

1478
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,559
there are two different streams one of

1479
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,040
them is to work on traditional documents

1480
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,960
such as faster route

1481
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,720
another one is to

1482
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,680
bring new work into itf that industry is

1483
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,480
looking forward to be standardized

1484
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,640
and we are going to discuss now so

1485
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,079
our traditional areas are faster out

1486
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,480
young models for things like vrp reef

1487
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,240
and other stuff that doesn't have home

1488
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,640
next slide

1489
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,960
please i'm going to work uh bgp peak

1490
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,480
there are at least four implementations

1491
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,359
i'm aware of done around 2015 so it has

1492
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,760
huge educational value for people who

1493
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,079
are coming networking right now and

1494
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,920
trying to learn how do we do faster out

1495
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,280
with bgp

1496
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,200
you know in some natural there are

1497
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,400
50 100

1498
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,880
150 million prefixes today how do you

1499
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,160
converge fast below second right so this

1500
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,359
is an explanation of particular

1501
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:46,160
instrumentation but again educationally

1502
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,240
a lot of people reading it and for them

1503
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,720
it's really the document to understand

1504
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,920
bgp faster out

1505
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,839
it's progressing i think we are

1506
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:59,680
text-wise getting close to working group

1507
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,520
plus call to

1508
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,040
finalize this work it's been around for

1509
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,480
a long time

1510
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,040
taylor fay being reviewed and thank you

1511
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,119
stuart bryant for his very valuable

1512
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,240
reviews

1513
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,480
so he's a shepherding he's shepherding

1514
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,640
this work and

1515
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,440
the number of commands he wants other to

1516
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,480
address but the progress is there

1517
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,680
atm bgp work that describe bgp framework

1518
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:28,879
for mobile space and aeronautical uh

1519
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:31,760
it's a

1520
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,000
reasonably complex and long document

1521
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,440
we're really happy to see that there's

1522
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,760
interest to review it to help

1523
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,640
authors to improve it so work is ongoing

1524
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,040
and we expect to

1525
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,599
start working group last call sometime

1526
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,119
after this atf

1527
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,000
next slide please

1528
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:53,200
uh we recently adopted uh

1529
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,240
vfd for vrp so we could use bfd to

1530
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,960
provide subsequent convergence for brp

1531
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,760
you know vrp usually runs slower than

1532
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,520
one second so the combination is very

1533
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,640
valuable

1534
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,720
especially as evpn

1535
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,559
is becoming de facto standard and in

1536
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,440
cases where it's pure layer 2 vrp

1537
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,760
is the technology to provide for slayer

1538
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,520
to help

1539
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,359
service extinguishers protection is in

1540
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,040
our traditional chapter we are working

1541
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,880
on faster out for different parts of

1542
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,680
network in this case service

1543
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,480
net to cloud work is told i don't think

1544
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,040
we are going to progress it i mean we've

1545
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,720
been trying to work with others for a

1546
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,480
couple of years on it and

1547
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,319
we don't really converge

1548
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:38,200
uh next slide please

1549
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,200
uh in young area we've published rfc

1550
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,599
1967 which is young model for routing

1551
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,680
policies which is used by all other

1552
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,359
routing protocols

1553
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,000
uh extended cheap young models ready for

1554
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,520
working with lost call there's no

1555
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,960
changes really

1556
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,760
and the qos model it's really good work

1557
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,200
here the addressing reviews the

1558
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,599
operational consideration related draft

1559
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:04,880
is progressing so after all the young

1560
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,400
doctor reviews have been addressed we

1561
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,520
are about to start working plus calls

1562
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,400
next slide please

1563
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,880
so new work

1564
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,880
via free spin or vrp version 3 exit 2

1565
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,039
address non-inclusive language as well

1566
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,039
as to integrate all the errata thank uec

1567
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,799
for taking this

1568
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,920
loop avoidance is again part of our

1569
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,680
traditional chapter as well as midpoint

1570
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,200
protection

1571
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,240
uh

1572
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,240
hpcc

1573
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,599
is new work and i'm going to discuss

1574
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,920
couple of items now that i see coming

1575
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,520
and are important

1576
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,480
uh

1577
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,680
it's not very visible yet but amount of

1578
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,039
traffic that have very different

1579
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,880
characteristics than what we see on

1580
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,200
internet is coming amount of rdma

1581
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,880
trafficking data center is going over

1582
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,240
the roof

1583
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,160
machine learning clusters are getting to

1584
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,079
50 to 100 megawatt size they require

1585
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,160
different type of feedback from end

1586
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,319
system into routing system so hpcc is an

1587
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,119
approach to provide clean api between

1588
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,760
host and network and venture influence

1589
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,240
routing

1590
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,359
another type of new work that's coming

1591
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,520
is semantic routing really what we are

1592
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,799
trying to do here is uh going

1593
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,720
further than just destination based

1594
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,280
lookup routing system

1595
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,680
what other fields can we use

1596
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,799
to

1597
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,799
provide better routing

1598
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,319
what's new

1599
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,480
what needs to be added to the packet in

1600
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,400
terms of encapsulations in terms of

1601
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,079
additional headers to provide us

1602
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,160
additional metadata

1603
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,039
to make routing better more efficient

1604
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,240
more load or more application friendly

1605
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,000
so it's kind of more research area right

1606
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,160
now there's some more going in irt

1607
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,359
there's number of drafts in routing but

1608
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:57,200
we are in very early stages still

1609
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,640
unclear where this work is going to

1610
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,319
happen

1611
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,240
actually back to hpcc we are in

1612
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,240
discussion with transport area because

1613
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,079
on one side it kind of influenced

1614
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:08,160
routing on another side it's congestion

1615
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,000
control really what you want to do is

1616
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,640
and host to get enough data to either

1617
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,640
send less traffic

1618
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,520
or perhaps change entropy so routing

1619
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,559
system have more metadata to larger

1620
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:21,920
traffic better

1621
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,839
so again it's all being discussed right

1622
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,359
now with transport area ideas and

1623
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,680
transport working group chairs

1624
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,440
last area is routing in satellites

1625
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,720
we see

1626
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,640
really large deployments of satellites

1627
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,799
networking with pixel starlink all the

1628
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:41,680
stuff is being deployed at huge scale

1629
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,920
they all run proprietary protocols today

1630
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,000
they don't interwork with each other

1631
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,960
there is definitely need for a

1632
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,359
routing protocol that can address the

1633
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,799
requirements of satellite system which

1634
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,200
is quite different than wire system due

1635
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,400
to changes due to sometimes proximity

1636
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,440
and not in transition links are going up

1637
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,720
and down

1638
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,039
so this is kind of early work we started

1639
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,799
here but eventually i believe there's

1640
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,480
really need for interoperability between

1641
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,039
different systems to provide what atf

1642
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,599
does best really solutions that allows

1643
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:14,799
different systems to work with each

1644
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:15,760
other

1645
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,319
so those are kind of three areas i see

1646
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:19,839
more and more discussions and we'll

1647
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:22,720
continue working on them

1648
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,200
questions

1649
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,680
uh tony yes we have

1650
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,799
satellite proposals

1651
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,160
excuse me

1652
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,319
how do we ever test satellite routing

1653
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,960
proposals

1654
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,359
very good question i mean we

1655
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,160
couldn't test spf before we put together

1656
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,760
specs right so we need to start

1657
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,359
somewhere we need to understand the

1658
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,200
characteristic of satellite networking

1659
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,680
we need to understand how to solve them

1660
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,359
and it's not really a new problem right

1661
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:55,520
we've done quite some work in monet on

1662
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,359
wireless systems so there's a lot of

1663
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,359
experience here

1664
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:02,079
by better understanding the

1665
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,559
problem space and what needs to be done

1666
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,960
eventually we could propose solutions

1667
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,400
that

1668
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,079
at least partially have been validated

1669
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,119
by atf and their working code that could

1670
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,920
be

1671
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,680
at least theoretically applied to the

1672
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,078
problem space

1673
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,400
and

1674
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,680
as of now

1675
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,160
north starling neither other satellite

1676
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,760
providers are actually coming to atf and

1677
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,920
asking us for a routing

1678
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,760
every system is fully vertically

1679
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,240
integrated and runs proprietary stuff

1680
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,839
but eventually

1681
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,599
it will come to that there's

1682
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,839
i mean it's just question of time not

1683
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,839
whether

1684
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,880
okay thank you

1685
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,960
were you gonna ask something there yeah

1686
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,720
i was i was trying to get my phone to

1687
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,480
load to get in the queue real quick i i

1688
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,400
suspect tony's question is actually more

1689
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,359
of

1690
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,119
is the intention of the satellite thing

1691
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,319
supposed to eventually get to a

1692
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:02,160
standards track where there would be

1693
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,839
multiple implementations and i think

1694
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,760
that that's where his original question

1695
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,039
came from

1696
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,960
is like how do you test interoperability

1697
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,160
it's not like

1698
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,000
uh i'm going to go and

1699
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,760
as akamai going to launch a satellite

1700
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,119
for example

1701
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,480
and then implement my own routing

1702
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,440
protocol

1703
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,680
so i think it would look similarly to

1704
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,039
igps when we started many years ago

1705
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,640
every vendor would run their own stuff

1706
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,520
right

1707
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,400
eventually industry would push them

1708
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,799
to provide something that interworks

1709
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,400
because no one wants to be locked into

1710
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,920
single vendor in this case single

1711
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,599
vertical provider

1712
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:36,559
so

1713
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:39,119
i think looking at deposit in the future

1714
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,880
industry would require interworking

1715
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,640
solution and

1716
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,960
testing is an interesting question

1717
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,160
but

1718
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,000
had been solved before with routing

1719
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
systems so i don't see any reasons why

1720
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,359
it wouldn't be solved with satellite

1721
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,759
systems

1722
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,440
tony does it answer

1723
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,359
yeah i'm speculating right i'm kind of

1724
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:04,720
trying to look into crystal ball

1725
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,720
really

1726
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,640
just just

1727
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,720
i'm sorry go ahead i'm just gonna say

1728
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,599
just just as a reminder to um people at

1729
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,520
the mic please identify yourselves thank

1730
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,279
you

1731
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,238
sorry tony lee jennifer um

1732
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:23,040
so i no i still don't understand why

1733
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,719
we're taking this on if the relevant

1734
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,238
companies haven't

1735
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,799
decided to pitch in and propose

1736
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:31,759
something

1737
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,279
they're doing it and we're not

1738
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,960
yeah so

1739
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,799
to repeat alvaro's comments we are not

1740
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:45,198
taking on yet the number of people who

1741
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:48,319
is interested on working on it and they

1742
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,120
brought their drafts to itf and we have

1743
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,399
presented them

1744
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,399
there's no formal

1745
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,279
i mean i'm not sure whether people who

1746
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:58,799
came up with this actually have

1747
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,479
satellite networking but they're

1748
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,640
interested in working in the space

1749
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,839
and it's related to routing and in this

1750
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:07,920
case we in routine working group decided

1751
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,279
to give them space to present

1752
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,319
their

1753
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,799
ideas

1754
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:16,238
so

1755
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,399
any further discussion of this topic

1756
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:23,198
should be in the rtwg mailing list

1757
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,520
we had already the meeting on monday

1758
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,719
afternoon

1759
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:27,520
so

1760
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,920
we need to continue with the agenda

1761
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,920
thank you thank you

1762
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,399
so you have seen only about a third of

1763
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:37,600
the working groups here and um there's a

1764
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,439
lot of exciting work

1765
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:42,080
there's a lot of current work that needs

1766
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,479
participation and review and

1767
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,640
and and the input from from all of you

1768
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,000
so please um the objective of these

1769
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,520
short presentations is for you to see

1770
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,640
what is going on in other places

1771
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,440
now we have a

1772
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,760
something different this is not

1773
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,800
something that is being worked in the

1774
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,199
itf right now

1775
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,640
but since

1776
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,360
the routing area open meeting is an open

1777
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,440
meeting and it's not a working group we

1778
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,520
invited adrian perrig

1779
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,360
from eth and

1780
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,960
apply systems

1781
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,360
to talk about zion which is something

1782
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,640
they've been working on for a while they

1783
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,159
have deployments

1784
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,760
and uh so he's going to provide an

1785
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,880
overview

1786
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,280
of that

1787
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,480
go ahead

1788
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,920
yeah many thanks

1789
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,360
alvaro

1790
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,440
it's a great honor to speak here it's

1791
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,360
quite amazing to see

1792
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,520
all the cool research and work going on

1793
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,080
in this group so many thanks for

1794
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,400
for an invitation i'm very happy to give

1795
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,080
a high level overview

1796
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,080
and dive a little bit into the details

1797
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,159
and talk about deployment of scion

1798
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,239
can i forward or

1799
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,239
okay

1800
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:53,920
so originally

1801
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,520
in 2009

1802
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,440
we looked at the research question of

1803
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,719
how secure can a global internet be and

1804
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:01,760
so we

1805
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,159
without any ambition to deploy we

1806
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,159
started with this research question

1807
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,560
and tried to think from a clean slate

1808
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,120
how how could one design highly secure

1809
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,120
inter-domain routing system

1810
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,199
and again we had no ambition initially

1811
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,040
and over time

1812
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,840
the ambition has grew and now we have

1813
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,520
six isps

1814
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,960
that offer

1815
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,560
sign connectivity

1816
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,560
to customers and with already productive

1817
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,239
use cases

1818
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,280
and so

1819
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,280
on this journey i'll tell you a little

1820
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,600
bit about what has happened

1821
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,920
and we started with a security-centric

1822
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,600
design so we tried to secure all the

1823
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,719
aspects

1824
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,480
of a communication

1825
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,840
architecture

1826
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,400
also including secure control messages

1827
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,840
and so on and so forth really every

1828
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,360
aspect we looked at

1829
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,920
from an adversarial perspective

1830
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,000
we also very early start with formal

1831
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,159
verification and i'll come back to this

1832
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:55,600
in a minute

1833
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,880
and

1834
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,199
also looked at scalability how can we

1835
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,840
design a system that can have very rapid

1836
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,840
convergence to enable global

1837
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,280
communication

1838
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,840
next

1839
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,760
slide so we're certainly not the first

1840
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,360
team who worked on this and they're

1841
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,640
roughly

1842
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,239
uh you know several dozens of different

1843
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,600
projects and we of course drew

1844
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,120
inspiration from many of these projects

1845
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,080
next line

1846
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,320
and so architectural principles we

1847
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,800
followed were to achieve stateless

1848
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,679
packet forwarding so to avoid

1849
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,360
inconsistent forwarding state on

1850
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,440
different routers so also the routing

1851
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,800
system itself

1852
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,440
has in a way no no convergence phase so

1853
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,239
there's

1854
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:39,679
it's always

1855
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,239
converged so to speak and

1856
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,920
that provides a lot of advantages

1857
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,000
it's an instance of path over networking

1858
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,719
so

1859
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,000
the pan panergy

1860
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,080
working group in irtf

1861
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,480
is looking at path over networks and

1862
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,600
scion is an instance of such a such a

1863
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,800
protocol

1864
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,520
it enables native multipath

1865
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,120
communication

1866
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,440
and again it was a security-based

1867
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,960
architecture

1868
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,800
with formal verification from the

1869
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,840
beginning

1870
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,640
and i'll talk a bit about transparency

1871
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,960
and also sovereignty of networking in a

1872
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,920
minute

1873
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,199
next line

1874
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,120
so the first insight that we had on this

1875
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,199
journey is and maybe it's obvious but

1876
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,679
still i think it's useful

1877
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,560
uh to to say this if you really need

1878
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,719
high assurance for a large scale

1879
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,120
distributed system you really have to

1880
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,520
have a formal verification and so we've

1881
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,400
done this in scion and worked with

1882
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,760
research groups

1883
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,400
of david basin and peter miller at eth

1884
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,480
and we found a lot of bugs in the

1885
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,120
process and we're able to very early

1886
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,199
change the design

1887
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:52,640
thanks to such a formal verification

1888
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,199
next slide

1889
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,760
so the first aspect of scion that i'd

1890
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,360
like to present is

1891
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,920
that we we started with was to achieve a

1892
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,320
sovereignty of networks so

1893
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,199
we said if the the roots of trust the

1894
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,760
cryptographic keys that define the trust

1895
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,120
routes they

1896
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,880
need to be local it's it's very

1897
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,719
difficult to create

1898
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:15,920
networks

1899
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,320
that have a few of these

1900
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,400
routes of trust that are

1901
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,719
distributed in in some way and so

1902
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,719
we created a structure with isolation

1903
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:25,840
domains

1904
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,159
that would locally define the roots of

1905
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:30,960
trust and then globally connect and

1906
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,679
cross-certify each other in a way

1907
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:36,159
so that was the initial idea but then

1908
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:39,520
actually turns out this also helped with

1909
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,600
scalability because the routing system

1910
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,560
then finds path segments across these

1911
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,159
isolation domains

1912
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,480
and also within each isolation domain so

1913
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,880
that's the high level motivation here

1914
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,120
and the next slide

1915
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,560
and so here's uh

1916
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,320
overview in one slide i'll go a little

1917
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,920
bit into more details in the following

1918
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,120
slides

1919
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,520
but in essence in the control plane path

1920
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,920
segments are being found

1921
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,800
through a process called beaconing

1922
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,920
between

1923
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,080
the what we call coriosis these are the

1924
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,360
main isps that manage these isolation

1925
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,560
domains

1926
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,800
they have a process that looks similar

1927
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,360
to how bgp operates to find these path

1928
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,880
segments

1929
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,600
and then within each isolation domain

1930
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,920
the beacons are only sent by these

1931
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,800
corios's so leafy asses they don't

1932
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,960
themselves initiate beacons

1933
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,640
and all the other s's

1934
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,320
except the core is simply forward this

1935
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,360
beacon so it's also highly scalable

1936
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,679
mechanism and so these path segments are

1937
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,719
found in this beaconing process

1938
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,480
they are then redistributed through a

1939
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,640
path server infrastructure

1940
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,199
that is a pull-based and not

1941
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,120
not push-based so it's

1942
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,760
very lightweight and highly scalable

1943
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,360
way to disseminate these path segments

1944
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,760
so you can think similar to how dns

1945
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,280
works

1946
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,480
and

1947
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,600
so

1948
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,159
when two entities want to communicate so

1949
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,080
in this example here we have a host in

1950
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,840
asf who wants to communicate with the

1951
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,239
host in ass

1952
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,640
and so it looks up these path segments

1953
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,800
in this example it gets the six path

1954
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,880
segments that can be combined

1955
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,640
in only two ways in this example

1956
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,440
then it encapsulates this forwarding

1957
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,640
information

1958
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,280
at the as level in the path in the

1959
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,560
packet header

1960
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,800
and so it can select for every packet

1961
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,000
which pathway wants to take

1962
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,560
the path information is also based not

1963
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,239
just as level but based on the

1964
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,719
interfaces between or the connections or

1965
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:46,880
the links between the ass

1966
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,640
so you have diversity

1967
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,360
if the same set of asses connects in

1968
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,960
many different places

1969
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,719
so you can make use

1970
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:58,400
of all these different path options

1971
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,560
so in the in the data plane then we have

1972
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,320
these packets with this information

1973
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,080
there's also cryptographic protections

1974
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,199
built in

1975
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:06,480
that prevent

1976
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,920
changes

1977
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,120
and

1978
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,640
then in the end

1979
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,960
routers become very simple they for the

1980
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,480
forward the packets based on this

1981
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,760
information

1982
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,080
and so in a way there's no per path

1983
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,520
state on routers

1984
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,040
routers essentially have a cryptographic

1985
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,880
actually only one single cryptographic

1986
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,840
key to verify this information and it's

1987
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,600
symmetric so it's

1988
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,679
extremely fast it can be checked in

1989
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,679
within nanoseconds

1990
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,159
right next line

1991
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,199
so

1992
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,360
in the control plane

1993
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,880
we've seen how these path segments are

1994
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,400
being created

1995
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,560
then in the data plane information is

1996
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,159
being extracted

1997
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:49,120
from this control plane information

1998
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,640
and there's also

1999
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,040
cryptographic protections built in so

2000
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,800
the control plane we use digital

2001
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,320
signatures

2002
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,600
to authenticate this routing information

2003
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,360
or this path information but then in the

2004
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,679
data plane there is highly efficient

2005
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,159
asymmetric key cryptography used

2006
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,280
to then

2007
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,600
ensure that paths cannot be forged or

2008
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,800
changed

2009
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,280
in any way that is not permitted by the

2010
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,440
architecture

2011
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,239
and so here we just see how

2012
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,400
fields are being extracted from the

2013
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,840
control plane

2014
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,400
and put into the data plane so

2015
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,880
the overhead is 12 bytes per aes that's

2016
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,320
being traversed

2017
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,640
12 bytes is not little but it's we

2018
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,120
believe given all the advantages

2019
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,120
that's

2020
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,000
that's a good trade-off right so for the

2021
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,600
actual forwarding

2022
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,199
two aes operations are needed and

2023
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,640
even in soft

2024
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,880
in software on commodity

2025
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,159
intel or arm or other chips amd

2026
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,040
it takes only about 30 cycles

2027
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,120
processor cycles to compute an as

2028
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,840
operation so this on a say three

2029
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,199
gigahertz system only takes 10

2030
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,480
nanoseconds

2031
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,480
per operation so this is even in

2032
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,679
software

2033
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,280
can be very high speed and of course in

2034
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,400
hardware

2035
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,640
it only takes a few nanoseconds to

2036
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,360
compute aes

2037
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,159
so next line

2038
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,560
so just a few details to give you a bit

2039
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,920
more intuition

2040
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,520
how this works so

2041
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,640
this

2042
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,800
beaconing process

2043
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,760
we have these coreys's so the main isps

2044
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,239
that govern an isolation domain they

2045
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:31,199
initiate these beacons then other aes is

2046
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,440
simply forward them

2047
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,840
across their interfaces based on the

2048
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,480
also routing policy and actually the

2049
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,840
policies

2050
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,400
we try to be very close to the economic

2051
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,920
principles of today's internet those

2052
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,920
with peering links and so on

2053
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,280
where society actually closely mirrors

2054
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,199
what happens in today's internet so we

2055
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,360
definitely

2056
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,239
want to adhere to those principles

2057
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,080
and so these path construction beacons

2058
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,480
they create path segments that can then

2059
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,120
be immediately used for communication

2060
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,840
next slide

2061
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,280
next line yeah great so then there is a

2062
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,760
path server also in each autonomous

2063
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,040
system that

2064
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,679
stores this path information so an as

2065
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:16,880
can select

2066
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,040
which paths it makes available

2067
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,639
it can

2068
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,360
locally tell its hosts which paths they

2069
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,639
can use to we call go upstream

2070
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,000
towards the core

2071
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,040
or

2072
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,120
and in the next slide

2073
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,600
also there is a passer in the core where

2074
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,800
an as

2075
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,440
can register how others can reach it so

2076
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:41,440
that's on the next slide please

2077
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,320
and so here one can do in a way ingress

2078
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,280
path control by

2079
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,880
selecting which paths are being

2080
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,120
communicated to other entities for

2081
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,360
reaching its as

2082
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,320
and

2083
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,639
so one can register only the paths that

2084
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:57,600
are

2085
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,719
compliant with one's policy and so then

2086
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,199
these paths anyone on the internet can

2087
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,800
then fetch to communicate in this

2088
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,800
example with this ass here

2089
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,360
next slide

2090
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,600
and so for communication then these path

2091
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,520
segments are being combined in various

2092
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,760
ways you can do also shortcuts so you

2093
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,280
don't have to go all the way back to the

2094
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,159
core

2095
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,639
but so here we see on this slide in blue

2096
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:25,440
the what we call up paths from our to

2097
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,920
the core is

2098
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,040
in green the down paths the 2s that s

2099
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,400
has registered

2100
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,040
and in orange the core paths that also

2101
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,880
are needed to connect

2102
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,560
some of the up segments to some of the

2103
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,159
down segments

2104
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,400
and then these yellow paths are the

2105
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,560
different paths that can be selected

2106
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,639
from and we see also one example of

2107
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,239
appearing link

2108
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,840
where um

2109
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,159
one can go and use the peerlink from o

2110
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,639
to p even though there's no

2111
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:55,440
um

2112
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,560
um

2113
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,080
direct uh

2114
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,639
links so to speak that is were no beacon

2115
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:03,199
when the cross but because both o and p

2116
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:04,480
announced the peering link with the

2117
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,639
right cryptographic information

2118
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:09,040
one can then combine this and make use

2119
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,440
of the peering link if they have all

2120
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,320
all the correct information and so

2121
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,639
the peering semantics are very similar

2122
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,960
to today's internet

2123
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,600
in the next slide

2124
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,719
so here also on the global scale these

2125
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,239
paths are combined and again we see

2126
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,639
several opportunities now maybe in this

2127
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,400
slide it's not that interesting but in

2128
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,760
general

2129
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,080
when we model the internet graph of

2130
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,400
course there's huge amount of path

2131
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,080
disjointness

2132
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,320
across the

2133
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,520
top isps and so we anticipate that a

2134
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,360
really very large number of paths

2135
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,520
assuming isps

2136
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,840
policies do permit

2137
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,679
communication and

2138
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:56,159
a lot of different path choices become

2139
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:58,639
become feasible

2140
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,199
next line

2141
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,080
so of course there's also many drawbacks

2142
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,320
to science so initially

2143
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,080
after dns lookup

2144
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,719
one also receives the isolation domain

2145
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,719
and the autonomous system number of the

2146
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:14,080
destination

2147
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,159
and then the path lookup actually is

2148
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,600
only done with the

2149
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,320
isolation domain number and autonomous

2150
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,920
system number

2151
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,080
and so the paths are obtained that way

2152
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,960
and that of course requires additional

2153
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,400
latency initially to start the

2154
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,840
communication

2155
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,520
although that is amortized because

2156
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,679
several path choices then enable

2157
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:36,480
latency optimization or

2158
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,639
bandwidth optimization or also the mtu

2159
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,320
is being

2160
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,639
provided also in these path segments

2161
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:44,719
so there's no mtu discovery that is

2162
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,480
needed anymore and so

2163
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,719
we believe that this initial

2164
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,239
increased latency

2165
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,280
is later regained and amortized to

2166
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,040
enable actually even more high-speed

2167
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,360
communication than if only a single path

2168
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,719
were available

2169
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,000
of course there's also bandwidth

2170
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,159
overhead and for this additional

2171
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,760
information

2172
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,719
although we believe that these 12 bytes

2173
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,000
per aes

2174
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,639
is is manageable

2175
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:13,360
operationally there is

2176
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,520
more effort in a sense that it's a

2177
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,520
security architecture so each ais needs

2178
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,120
to have a certificate

2179
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,120
that requires additional management

2180
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,239
overhead

2181
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:24,320
and also the initial setup cost uh

2182
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,480
training people and so on is actually

2183
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:30,560
the the biggest cost in in scion because

2184
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,040
people need to learn uh how this works

2185
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,880
and for isps though

2186
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:35,840
it's

2187
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,880
um

2188
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,120
turns out it all it's only a few days of

2189
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,600
training for their employees but still

2190
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,199
of course that's a lot of effort and

2191
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:44,639
that's

2192
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:47,120
actually higher more cost than the cost

2193
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,400
of the hardware

2194
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,320
we've experienced

2195
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,639
next line

2196
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,880
so for an isp the deployment is actually

2197
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,000
quite simple

2198
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
people have referred to as a homeopathic

2199
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,320
upgrade to a nice view so it's not

2200
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,320
that much that much effort

2201
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,560
in essence the isp set up a few border

2202
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,840
routers

2203
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,040
and

2204
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,520
path server certificate servers on the

2205
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,880
beacon servers

2206
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,560
which are just

2207
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,840
hosts within the network and

2208
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,719
so

2209
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,960
there's been a lot of surprise how

2210
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,440
little work it actually is to

2211
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,600
become a cyanispy of course integrating

2212
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,159
this with internal processes can be

2213
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:30,560
quite complicated

2214
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,920
but to

2215
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,080
get started it's actually

2216
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,280
less effort than one things

2217
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,560
okay

2218
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,639
and there's no changes to internal

2219
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:42,320
infrastructure

2220
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,000
of the isp that's also important to say

2221
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
so sign can reuse

2222
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,920
the internal switching fabric be the

2223
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,719
mpls or an ip switched backbone or

2224
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:51,840
whatever

2225
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,520
and sound traffic can

2226
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,800
reuse

2227
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,480
the internal fabric

2228
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,800
thank you next slide

2229
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,000
also for and and customers

2230
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,880
the deployment has been

2231
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,639
actually quite straightforward because

2232
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:09,840
of a sign ip gateway that translates

2233
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,199
between ip

2234
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,280
and sign traffic so the end applications

2235
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,360
and hosts don't need to even know

2236
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,520
about this new infrastructure

2237
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,480
and so several customers use this in

2238
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,080
production actually already for several

2239
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,280
years

2240
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,520
and benefit

2241
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,719
from the

2242
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:28,560
opportunities of cyan without having to

2243
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,440
change

2244
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,679
any of the applications

2245
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,000
of course there's also end host stacks

2246
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,080
that can then make use of cyan natively

2247
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,520
but

2248
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,639
initially it's of course much simpler to

2249
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:45,679
to transparently translate between ip

2250
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,280
enzyme

2251
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,840
next

2252
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,639
line so the current deployments um

2253
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:54,800
are left by on a fire systems the the

2254
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,600
global uh scion network

2255
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,440
um was constructed in a way that it's

2256
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,840
not an overlay that it's really

2257
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:02,880
as

2258
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,639
independent failure models from bgp so

2259
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:07,920
there's no

2260
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,920
dependence of the today's assigned

2261
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,280
backbone

2262
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:14,000
on bgp so that's already quite nice to

2263
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:14,880
have

2264
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,719
these two independent systems

2265
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:19,120
even though they run over some of the

2266
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:22,400
same networks internally

2267
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,000
there's also three different

2268
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,840
implementations there's an open open

2269
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,920
source implementation in go

2270
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,239
on apaya has their own proprietary high

2271
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:33,440
performance implementation and synthlabs

2272
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,280
built the sign router

2273
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,560
mp4

2274
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,239
that achieved

2275
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,719
over a terabit of throughput

2276
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,639
and

2277
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:44,960
these are the current implementations

2278
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,520
the deployment there's

2279
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,639
uh six isps that offer a native sign

2280
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,239
connectivity the first three in

2281
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:53,600
switzerland

2282
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,520
and the others

2283
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,719
actually cyberlink is also in

2284
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:58,560
switzerland

2285
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,320
but of course um

2286
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,880
additional ones exist and are already

2287
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,320
trying out so one can get signed

2288
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,920
connectivity for instance in any

2289
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,920
household in south korea

2290
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,400
and it's also spreading in the sense

2291
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,639
that more and more isps are interested

2292
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,440
in their joining this network

2293
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,159
also ixps are making use of it

2294
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,960
and i should also say the whole

2295
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,960
deployment has been driven by swiss

2296
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,800
banks who are interested in secure

2297
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,159
communication

2298
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:28,560
and so they built a secure swiss finance

2299
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,040
network that makes use of this

2300
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,320
technology

2301
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,920
and

2302
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,480
the early parts are going back

2303
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:39,360
production uses to 2017

2304
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,080
so the technology has been in production

2305
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,239
now for almost five years

2306
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:46,159
successfully

2307
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,719
next line

2308
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,760
so for standardization there's

2309
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,800
of course

2310
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,920
work to be done and also that's why

2311
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,440
we're here

2312
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,199
and i believe we

2313
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,280
satisfy a lot of the success factors

2314
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,120
needed for standardization

2315
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,679
in rfc 5218

2316
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,760
and we've also had a site meeting

2317
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,440
yesterday to discuss

2318
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,280
how we could go about this

2319
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,800
standardization we're very much looking

2320
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,360
forward to also feedback from this group

2321
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,440
to getting your advice how we could

2322
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,440
proceed

2323
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,919
next line

2324
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,040
lots of resources exist um

2325
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:29,199
code and uh on san architecture papers

2326
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:31,600
a book there's also a new book coming

2327
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,880
out

2328
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,880
we're just waiting for the printer to to

2329
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,320
hit the print button

2330
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,480
so hopefully the new book from springer

2331
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,159
for lock will be

2332
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:42,239
coming out uh within

2333
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:45,040
a few weeks

2334
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,519
next line

2335
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,480
so one observation i briefly wanted to

2336
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:53,040
talk about was that

2337
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,400
stable paths and multipath is necessary

2338
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,679
and not just

2339
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:00,159
a luxury

2340
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,520
so

2341
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,440
with single path forwarding it's

2342
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,040
difficult to achieve strong availability

2343
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,560
guarantees for instance during route

2344
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,480
convergence and we've also seen

2345
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,880
one has to do work to prevent routing

2346
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,639
loops

2347
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:15,199
so during pro convergence no path may be

2348
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,679
available and

2349
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:20,480
it can take some time for routing

2350
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,560
protocols to to update

2351
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,120
and so the the point here is

2352
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,080
that having a multi-native multi-path

2353
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,280
protocol enables very quick failover in

2354
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,760
case of link disruptions or path

2355
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,040
disruptions

2356
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,760
by an allowing the application to switch

2357
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,000
to an alternative path that's that's

2358
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,199
already

2359
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:42,639
operational

2360
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:45,520
so i'll give in the next slide two

2361
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:48,639
next two slides two examples

2362
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:51,520
for why this is necessary so

2363
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,920
the first one is about bottleneck

2364
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,440
routing so we've seen

2365
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,000
several real world events that had

2366
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,520
were quite noticeable at the global

2367
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,880
scale

2368
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,560
of outages were

2369
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,840
the the protocol changed to a path that

2370
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,760
had insufficient bandwidth

2371
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,679
then resulted in high packet loss so the

2372
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:10,560
path

2373
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,560
was operational but had such high packet

2374
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,760
loss that

2375
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,520
applications were not

2376
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,560
usable

2377
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,199
and it took quite some time to recover

2378
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,719
because the routing system thought well

2379
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:24,239
the the path is working but in fact

2380
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,239
for applications it was not practically

2381
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:27,360
usable

2382
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,400
and so

2383
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,040
this this is one example where

2384
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,440
even a secure protocol

2385
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,960
would not have operated because in both

2386
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,480
of these cases

2387
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,000
the path that was switched to that had

2388
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,679
insufficient bandwidth was a correct

2389
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,400
path so security by itself

2390
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,320
would not have addressed this issue on

2391
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,440
the next slide we see another example of

2392
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,960
where withdrawals

2393
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,880
messages were not being sent and so

2394
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,719
there was an outage

2395
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:55,440
because of the lack of um of the

2396
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,280
withdrawal message

2397
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,840
so then on the next slide we see

2398
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:00,880
that

2399
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,639
the the insight i'd like to share here

2400
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:03,520
is

2401
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,120
that a secure routing protocol is

2402
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,320
actually not sufficient one really needs

2403
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,560
a multi-path system

2404
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,400
to be able to deal with these cases

2405
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,679
because

2406
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,560
in some cases you have correct messages

2407
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,639
that then result in outages

2408
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:20,800
but having a native multipath system

2409
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,760
with

2410
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,520
several choices then allow you to very

2411
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,840
quickly switch over

2412
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,480
to different paths

2413
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,960
next line

2414
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,960
so in summary

2415
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,239
sign connectivity is available today

2416
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:37,679
it's already in

2417
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:40,880
over 180 data centers across the globe

2418
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,639
where you can get

2419
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,800
native sign connectivity at

2420
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,120
and so that's quite exciting to have an

2421
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,480
independent

2422
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,000
system that is there

2423
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,920
that is already available today it's

2424
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,639
also high performance

2425
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:57,360
because pathware networks allow you to

2426
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,280
perform application specific

2427
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,760
optimizations and that is not just for

2428
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:02,880
security

2429
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,199
but also has the opportunity to give

2430
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:09,120
higher performance to end applications

2431
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,520
and also of course the whole system was

2432
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,120
designed for high security high

2433
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,040
assurance availability

2434
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:18,320
to also um

2435
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,040
even with secure control messages and so

2436
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,360
on so really security up to the last

2437
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,360
point and this has been a

2438
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,040
12 year long journey

2439
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:30,000
for us starting actually in 2009

2440
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,400
and the team is

2441
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,960
at eth and

2442
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,480
several collaborators is shown on the

2443
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,040
next slide and so many thanks

2444
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:39,920
for

2445
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,719
for your attention

2446
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,320
not sure if you have time for questions

2447
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,239
or uh yeah thank you adrian uh we have

2448
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:48,880
some time for questions or comments

2449
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,920
um please in the queue if you have any

2450
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,280
question or comment for already during

2451
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,679
about this

2452
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,320
get in the queue meaning in the meat

2453
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,480
echo but go ahead totally i'm just

2454
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,719
trying you know i'm old-timer pre

2455
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,320
pre-covert

2456
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,559
um

2457
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,199
um

2458
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:14,239
i just said so

2459
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:17,040
yeah audio sucks um

2460
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,800
the i didn't see from this well thank

2461
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,320
you very much for the presentation that

2462
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,880
was very nice um although i knew it but

2463
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,400
uh anyhow

2464
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,199
um

2465
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,920
i didn't quite see you know um

2466
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,679
some background information about you

2467
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:32,800
know who would be the operators of the

2468
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,400
current you know deployment that you

2469
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,560
have in terms of you mentioned 180 data

2470
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,520
centers

2471
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,280
could you kind of elaborate a little bit

2472
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,440
about that current operational

2473
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,920
you know motivations or so

2474
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,480
who those folks are that are running the

2475
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,400
virtual machines i guess or

2476
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,960
um and and what their experience is

2477
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:51,679
right

2478
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:53,520
yeah very good thank you

2479
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,119
um so

2480
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:56,639
in in switzerland we have swisscom

2481
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,719
sunrise switch

2482
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,800
and

2483
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,760
as the main operators and now

2484
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,040
cyberlink has a new isp joining them

2485
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,520
and globally inner cloud has this

2486
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,520
network where they're offering cloud

2487
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,280
connectivity

2488
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,920
there are over 180 data centers

2489
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,000
where they then provide also

2490
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,520
connectivity inside cloud deployments

2491
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,440
and so their their offering is to

2492
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,400
provide

2493
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,159
native science connectivity also in

2494
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:29,920
inside inside cloud deployments

2495
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,800
also talindus in luxembourg

2496
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,119
is is one of the

2497
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,679
isps and but they're more more coming

2498
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:39,840
some of them

2499
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,600
not in

2500
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,679
not with official products but

2501
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:44,880
doing

2502
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,480
more more poc like uh offerings

2503
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,080
but the the network is growing and

2504
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,480
they're more and more isp is not joining

2505
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,400
this this network

2506
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,600
we're simply looking out to make sure

2507
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,440
that

2508
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,760
it is running independently from other

2509
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,080
systems so if other systems fail sign

2510
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,840
would not be affected and of course vice

2511
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,520
versa as well

2512
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,600
no because i mean you you've been asking

2513
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,440
about you know how to proceed with

2514
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:14,719
something like this in the ietf and

2515
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:16,480
typically the best driver to do

2516
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,280
something is to basically show the need

2517
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,600
to define the interoperable

2518
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,239
components of something like this if if

2519
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,800
it's in routing then then the routing

2520
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,400
components of course you may be driven

2521
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,520
around

2522
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,360
different areas depending on you know oh

2523
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,440
the security aspects we have no idea we

2524
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,440
tried and failed go to security area and

2525
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:36,480
so on but

2526
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,320
effectively it is exactly what i was

2527
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,560
asking for in terms of a list of

2528
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,480
operators that want to have this that

2529
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,960
feel that if the ietf provides

2530
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,960
standardized

2531
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,560
rfcs

2532
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,639
that it helps them to achieve for what

2533
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,480
they've already been doing in their

2534
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,119
private idaho so to speak so far um a

2535
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:57,600
better um yeah uh

2536
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,760
reliable standardized interval

2537
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,280
experience right so i think that's

2538
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,119
that's going to in our role can probably

2539
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,119
tell you a lot more about that i think

2540
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:07,040
that's that's the the starting point to

2541
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,880
figure out the strategy on how to

2542
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,480
proceed with this in the idf

2543
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,239
hi i'm simon leinan responding to

2544
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,960
turner's question directly so we are

2545
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,480
i'm with switch

2546
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:25,360
we're one of those operators who

2547
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,119
have been running scion services and

2548
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:28,800
we're offering this on a commercial

2549
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,199
basis

2550
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:33,360
for a deployment in the financial

2551
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,960
industry mostly

2552
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,440
uh well our industry oh our interest is

2553
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,840
that this becomes something uh

2554
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,600
sustainable and independent of uh from

2555
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,320
like a research group or startup

2556
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,800
um so of course we we will be happy for

2557
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,440
this to be standardized um in a sort of

2558
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,360
a neutral forum that's one

2559
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,560
one aspect also probably the the quality

2560
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,320
of the implementation would also benefit

2561
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:02,080
from review in a form such as the itf

2562
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:06,960
yes as to how to bring this work um

2563
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,639
from the

2564
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,560
the academic research sector but also

2565
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,719
from operators who

2566
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,000
not

2567
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,760
who are not necessarily using

2568
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,520
interacting with the idf

2569
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,679
is a different question and i guess

2570
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:21,119
that's uh

2571
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,880
sort of for

2572
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,880
the ietf uh bureaucracy to um

2573
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:31,600
to facilitate uh yeah

2574
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,159
but if you have questions about uh how

2575
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:35,920
this feels to an operator i'm happy to

2576
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,679
talk to people

2577
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:38,960
thanks

2578
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,679
thank you simon jeff

2579
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,600
uh jeff and sir first of all i'm happy

2580
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,840
to see here uh we've been discussing a

2581
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,119
couple of years of our linkedin

2582
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,600
messaging right

2583
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,760
it was a good idea to come here

2584
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,280
the next step would be to really

2585
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,679
decouple problem spaces

2586
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,360
it's not just routing it's name

2587
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:00,000
resolution it's addressing the more

2588
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,320
more things that this that are not

2589
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,560
standardized by etfs today right

2590
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,440
so when someone sees this for the first

2591
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,119
time it looks like ball in the ocean

2592
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:11,280
because you're replacing dns you you're

2593
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,360
talking about stuff that really

2594
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,760
incomprehensible to some degree

2595
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,920
so you came here to meet us as well

2596
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,560
right it goes both ways

2597
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,480
so you figured out already that there's

2598
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,040
area that works on dns areas that work

2599
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,719
on ip address and carrier that works and

2600
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:28,560
routing this where you are now

2601
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,520
try to break your problem statement into

2602
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,320
smaller comprehendable pieces that could

2603
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,000
be addressed by particular areas and

2604
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,560
people who know what this is about that

2605
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,440
would be really good next step for you

2606
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,880
yeah thanks thank you very much for the

2607
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,199
advice

2608
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,840
uh jared mont

2609
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,239
so i think similar to the side meeting

2610
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:53,760
that we had yesterday

2611
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,159
it would help also to understand is the

2612
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:58,480
intention to bring the scion work

2613
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:02,800
forward or is it to go and bring the

2614
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,360
uh the technological capabilities that

2615
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,760
was developed as part of scion into the

2616
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,280
other protocols that are already

2617
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,440
existing within the ietf

2618
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,639
uh and

2619
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,800
determining sort of which

2620
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,840
pathway you know you're looking to go

2621
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,800
uh that that would i think help a lot of

2622
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,400
us because similar to what jeff said it

2623
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,960
does feel a lot like boiling the ocean

2624
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,880
and so if we're trying to say okay we

2625
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,119
need to go and secure these protocols we

2626
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:30,880
need to secure them you know as i

2627
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,719
brought up yesterday you know you know

2628
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:34,880
start down at the lynx state where we

2629
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,159
traditionally build a lot of the

2630
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:37,199
networks

2631
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,119
you know from there on up and figure out

2632
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:40,800
okay what infrastructure needs to be

2633
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,440
changed or modified or improved

2634
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,040
in order to have the properties that

2635
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:47,679
make this uh valuable for the financial

2636
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:49,520
institutions and others that

2637
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,800
are using it and have a much clearer uh

2638
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,040
you know kind of a clear goal set out of

2639
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,600
there so if if you have like comments on

2640
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,920
that if you if that's the intent or like

2641
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,520
if you're trying to improve the

2642
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,800
protocols such that they have these

2643
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,080
properties or if the goal is to bring

2644
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,920
this forward in independently and have

2645
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,280
this be another

2646
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,119
overlay network that people can run on

2647
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:13,440
top of ip

2648
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:14,560
right

2649
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,280
so the intent is definitely to

2650
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,560
bring the the whole protocol to

2651
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,239
standardize and with all the

2652
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:24,560
consequences but of course i was having

2653
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,400
cross fertilization

2654
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,040
with other efforts to see how can they

2655
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,400
benefit from sign and how can sign

2656
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,000
benefit from them i think there's also a

2657
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,679
lot of possible interactions with

2658
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:35,760
segment routing for instance

2659
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,600
um and other working groups as well so

2660
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,400
um

2661
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,800
i think there was one more point but

2662
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:45,199
it just escaped me but

2663
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:46,880
um

2664
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,000
that definitely

2665
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,960
i see

2666
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,119
there's a lot of potential uh possible

2667
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:52,560
interactions

2668
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,080
with different groups and different

2669
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,320
efforts and including

2670
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,280
um improving scion itself and

2671
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,360
making it

2672
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,559
make it better over time

2673
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:12,080
in fact this

2674
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,400
this example of a world protocol shoot

2675
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,800
addressing a set of use cases that are

2676
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,960
very interesting to customers for

2677
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,880
specific isps

2678
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,040
relates to for me

2679
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,920
to the question of deployments of

2680
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,480
experiments or

2681
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,600
lower market use cases in

2682
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,760
in networks that are

2683
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,880
produ used in production and it relates

2684
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,199
to a work that has been presented

2685
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:42,639
in irtf i think one or two meetings ago

2686
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:45,280
about tcpls and

2687
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,920
the members of the tcpls team

2688
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:48,719
have

2689
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:51,119
proposed a mechanism called protocol

2690
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:54,239
plugins in order to deploy

2691
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,960
innovation in actual production networks

2692
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:59,600
in the form of small vms so

2693
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,159
maybe one work that could be interested

2694
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:06,239
to interesting to do in iitf would be to

2695
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:08,800
have a method for

2696
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,840
researchers and people willing to deploy

2697
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:15,040
new use use cases and new protocols

2698
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,159
to interact with vendors and operators

2699
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:20,480
to deploy those those new things and

2700
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,800
find ways to

2701
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,480
manage their experiments in isolation

2702
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,960
for the time they are not successful

2703
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,440
enough for wide adoption but yet

2704
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,920
not arming the running of the

2705
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,840
operational networks and i think it

2706
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,719
would be a very valuable work to

2707
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:41,440
do in ietf to address the problem of the

2708
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,960
ossification of the internet

2709
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,840
thanks and jeff

2710
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:53,920
and the timing is impeccable uh

2711
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,719
at least in u.s part of the world fcc

2712
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:59,440
has published requests for information

2713
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,440
just two weeks ago asking how can bgp so

2714
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,639
insecure right with war in

2715
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:06,639
ukraine and everything else

2716
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:10,080
the visibility of insecurity of routing

2717
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,280
system

2718
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,080
got bumped up to the highest level

2719
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,080
so i think we are going to see more

2720
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,719
funding and more industry interest

2721
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,280
because finally there is a

2722
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:24,480
driver to go to the next step

2723
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,920
right i think they are very surprised

2724
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,400
that bgp sec is not only not deployed

2725
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,320
there are no commercial implementations

2726
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,440
at least not

2727
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,199
shipping implementations

2728
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:35,119
so there's going to be a huge push to do

2729
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:37,360
something on top of uh

2730
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,199
origin validation

2731
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:40,320
and

2732
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,080
it's going to be either bgp set

2733
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,760
something better something probably more

2734
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,560
deployable than this but a solution

2735
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,960
needs to come i mean finally there is

2736
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,960
interest of government there's money

2737
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,480
there's industry

2738
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,400
pushing for it so

2739
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,400
great good time

2740
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,000
