one of the things

98
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,040
as well is the idf code of conduct

99
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,720

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,280
an elevation to uh standards um for one

174
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,319
of the the other documents um it's very

175
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,960
close to being published it's still in

176
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,800
the rc at the queue i didn't see any

177
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
messages today but expect this one to be

178
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,599
published within i think the next the

179
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,479
next days or week

180
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,680
then another one is the use of

181
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,520
internationalized email addresses in the

182
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,840
ebb protocol so internationalized email

183
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
addresses

184
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,759
this document has passed working group

185
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,400
last call

186
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,879
but we are during working group last

187
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,000
call this document changed a few times

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,199
and we assume that this is for

189
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,000
uh

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,479
that that it didn't

191
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,599
uh change anything substantial

192
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,879
which is why we uh we want the uh

193
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,879
document shepard to state that on the

194
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,879
mailing list and then do his write-up

195
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,560
before we can submit this to the

196
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
isg

197
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,840
and i see james gould in the queue there

198
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,479
james go ahead

199
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,919
do you want to say something can you

200
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,960

201
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,440
[Music]

202
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,000
or should i

203
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
so james is in the queue but he's having

204
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,800
some audio issues

205
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,519
i think i can hear him in the background

206
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,120
it's very very faint though

207
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,959
well if you can type your comment in the

208
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,120
chat room jim we'll uh we'll read it out

209
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
for you

210
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,040
he's gonna add a comment in the chat

211
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
room i see it over here

212
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,399
okay

213
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,040
um i don't see jody in the

214
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,800
participants

215
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
um

216
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,839
list i actually wanted to ask him a

217
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,600
question you know how far he is with um

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,800
yeah

219
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
um so um

220
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,040
james said in the indie chat you know

221
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,399
nothing material was changed to the

222
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,560
draft we know this i mean jim and i have

223
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
read the draft too we think

224
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,320
that there is not no that there are no

225
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,839
material changes

226
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,440
made during last call but since we jim

227
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,279
and i need to be impartial here the

228
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,760
process is that the document shepard

229
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,200
is supposed to state that as an

230
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,920
independent reviewer

231
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,079
and basically we're waiting for that and

232
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,360
then when

233
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,519
jody has done that he should also do the

234
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,120
write-up as the document shepherd

235
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,640
but since jody is not in the room

236
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,880
jim and i will continue to harass him on

237
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,680
that and to make sure that that he's

238
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,920
doing that but so if anybody is aware

239
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,720
that

240
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,880
if anybody's asking why this is taking

241
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,200
so long uh at the moment it's it's on

242
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
the document shepard if it takes much

243
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
longer we

244
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
might want to

245
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,120
look for another document shepard

246
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
but

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,440
let's let's first

248
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,519
give jody a fair chance to

249
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,920
do this

250
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
then

251
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,680
we change use uh

252
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
jim and you'll do it from uh from here

253
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,959
on for the existing work because i think

254
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,079
the first

255
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:08,959
one

256
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,399
that's on the list

257
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,680
is the simple registration reporting and

258
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,360
you are the one to

259
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
state something about the progress of

260
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,160
this document

261
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,800
uh yes thanks um

262
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,760
let me um first just put a chair on for

263
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,279
a moment and and remind us um we we uh

264
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,560
in the beginning we were talking about

265
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,440
notes

266
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,680
um we we should have asked for people

267
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,440
for for um

268
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,760
the uh the agendas pre-loaded in in the

269
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
notes uh the note-taking uh thing over

270
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,040
here we really would just like for uh

271
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,160
folks to add a bullet whenever you hear

272
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,880
uh an interesting point um and just put

273
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,839
that in the in in the notes so uh we're

274
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,920
just gonna depend on the recording in

275
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,920
the chat room here to keep us honest and

276
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,800
the note-taking facility uh is is just

277
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,959
for capturing actions and decision

278
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,000
points

279
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,959
so if anyone could feel free to add that

280
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,360
about their documents or any question

281
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,519

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,240
the query model to represent

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,600
a

337
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,880
reverse

338
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,839
reverse search based on any relationship

339
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,760
between

340
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,320
the rdap object classes

341
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,440
and i changed the the role

342
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,920
path segment into a query parameter

343
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,560
now i think that

344
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,000
the document is

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,240
is in good shape and

346
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,040
is substantially ready for

347
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,439
to go into the working group last call

348
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,839
it includes two

349
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,680
dependencies from two

350
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
draft

351
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,000
drafts but they are informative

352
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
references

353
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,480
okay very well so

354
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,839
conclusion for this talking you think

355
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,360
it's ready for working good glass call

356
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
we saw your um

357
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
request for that and um we will follow

358
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,839
up on that on the mailing list after

359
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,639
this

360
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,399
yeah itf meeting uh tom i volunteered to

361
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,800
to share the document so

362
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,600
uh

363
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,800
i think that

364
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,399
you agree

365
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,120
yeah

366
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,079
thomas

367
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
is the document shepard we we already

368
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
discussed this with him that this

369
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,880
document has a

370
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,519
quite long reputation especially for the

371
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,199
uh

372
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,000
privacy considerations section um he's

373
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
all aware of that so

374
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,680
we'll be

375
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,040
expected to

376
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,360
have this in working group last call in

377
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,079
the next weeks

378
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,199
then the third document uh federated

379
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,279
authentication using open id

380
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,959
is scots in the room or in the

381
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,360
meeting

382
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,959
scott do you want to make comments for

383
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,720
this one

384
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,120
uh sure antoine um i'm not in the room

385
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,839
i'm remote

386
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,000
yep yeah so so this document changed

387
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,360
extensively since we last met it shifted

388
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,120
from a token management approach that

389
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,199
put that burden on the client

390
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,440
to a token management approach that puts

391
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,600
the burden on the server

392
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,759
and in doing that i think it made the

393
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,560
document much more acceptable you know

394
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,040
to people who are familiar with open id

395
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,120
oauth and how it's commonly implemented

396
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,519
in web services

397
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,520
i've got a few more minor changes to

398
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,679
make based on feedback received from the

399
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,919
last update but once i make those

400
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,240
changes i think we've got a document

401
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,760
that's in really really really good

402
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,799
shape

403
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
the only other thing i'd like to ask

404
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,959
people to look at is the list of query

405
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,280
purposes that are currently there

406
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,520
uh those are part of a proposal for an

407
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,559
iana registry of query purposes but if

408
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,799
we agree that those purposes

409
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,240
you know cover the use cases we're

410
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,720
familiar with i think this document will

411
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,320
too will be ready for working group last

412
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,840
call with one more update

413
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,480
that's a really good news scott because

414
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
this this has been on our plate for

415
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,799
quite some time as well of course

416
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,200
does anybody have any questions to scott

417
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,520
about the changes or about the status of

418
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,080
the document

419
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
if not

420
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,799
then we will move on

421
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,919
to the next one and that is

422
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,400
js contact

423
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
and that's again mario do you want to

424
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,880
say anything about this one as well

425
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,200
yes

426
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,080
uh i just made only editorial changes

427
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,840
since last meeting so i correct um

428
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,640
i update the references due to the

429
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,919
transfer

430
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,440
of the js contact document from jmf to

431
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,520
collect

432
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,760
but nothing else so

433
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,120
i don't know if now it is the

434
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,760
right moment right time to

435
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,000
ask for the

436
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
working group last call because the

437
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,160
guest contact documents are expected to

438
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,840
a schedule to

439
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,799
to go into working group law school

440
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,120
next july

441
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,360
so

442
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,679
i don't think that

443
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,640
there will be a

444
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,840
important

445
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
changes

446
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,480
in the in the next

447
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,120
until july in the in this document so

448
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,880
i would suggest to

449
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,600
go into working group last call

450
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,919
and uh i know that there is obviously a

451
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,679
a deep er sun to depend in two

452
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,840
dependencies from

453
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,799
the js contact documents it seems to me

454
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,000
normal

455
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,360
so

456
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,039
i don't know what is the

457
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,919
the the right procedure in this case i

458
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,880
never

459
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,919
i never

460
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,640
experienced before so

461
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,000
i

462
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,760
i trust in your experience to to to do

463
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,960
what is the

464
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,200
the the right

465
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,720
track to follow

466
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,919
yeah yeah

467
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,120
thank you mario yeah for for folks that

468
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,520
didn't didn't get this yet there are two

469
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,440
normative references in this document

470
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
two internet drafts which of course are

471
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
not allowed

472
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,720
and so we are actually waiting for the

473
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,280
uh the two other drafts which are not in

474
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,799
this working group but they're another

475
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,440
working group on js contact

476
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
to be published together with this

477
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,559
document in one go uh and therefore we

478
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,559
have normative references to rfcs and

479
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,520
not to

480
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
to to internet droughts we already

481
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,320
discussed this with with murray um our

482
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,640
area director um

483
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,039
he says it won't be a problem they will

484
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,679
just queue up and so we can do the

485
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,760
working group last call but be expected

486
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,520
not to

487
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,400
to have them published until the other

488
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,120
two documents are to be published as

489
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,640
well

490
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,400
and i see murray in room murray i don't

491
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
know if you want to add anything to that

492
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,400
no no uh it's okay for me now for murray

493
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,280
i said murray not married i'm sorry

494
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,320
i have nothing

495
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,720
that sounds right

496
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,640
okay so yes that's the status of the pro

497
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,280
of the uh of of this document uh it

498
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,120
means that we can go into working group

499
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,919
last call with this one but it is in no

500
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,159
hurry at all since we have to do this

501
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,159
before july when the other two documents

502
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,840
uh will also uh be uh be published in

503
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,400
the other working group uh so i propose

504
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,039
that since we have already

505
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,360
three requests for working group last

506
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,320
calls

507
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,360
we can do this one after the other three

508
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,000
um if you're okay with that mario and

509
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,400
because it will it will be linking

510
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
lingering around anyway

511
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,679
no problem at all

512
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,720

if i'm correct

522
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,720
i have to scroll down the whole no

523
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,480
they're both not here

524
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,360
um so let's deal with this one uh

525
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,400
further on the mailing list um

526
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,960
i don't th this one is not in working

527
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,679
group last school yet if i'm correct uh

528
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,200
there's still work in progress here to

529
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,799
be done

530
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,840
so that's that let's uh let's let's just

531
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,240
keep that there

532
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
then the next one is the registration

533
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,480
data dictionary i don't know jim did you

534
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,600
find the slides already

535
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,400
so if you can upgrade upload the slides

536
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,200
for this one and i will give the floor i

537
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,600
think to heather or steve

538
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,440
steve i see you in the queue yeah there

539
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
they are

540
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,559
yes heather will speak first and then me

541
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,600
okay

542
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,120
if jim can put the slides

543
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,440
or yeah i think i can request to share

544
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,720
them as well

545
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,000
if i hit the right button yeah they're

546
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,039
in the meeting materials

547
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,440
did you want to do it heather you can go

548
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,280
ahead

549
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
yeah but then we have to stop sharing

550
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,039
slides first right

551
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,320
let's see yes

552
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
yeah

553
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,559
okay so i stopped sharing slides

554
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,400
okay

555
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
and

556
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,840
let's see if i hit

557
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,520
this button

558
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,159
and this button

559
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,559
did that share slides not yet

560
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,200
let's try again

561
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,880
but um

562
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,799
heather you and i are gonna

563
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,960
switch off maybe if jim could run the

564
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,280
slides we'd both be in better shape

565
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,480
um true it's not it's not sharing it's

566
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,760
opening them up for me but it's not

567
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,360
sharing them so

568
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
yeah and they're not in the preloaded

569
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,919
slides yet normally before the meeting

570
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,400
we have pre-loaded slides

571
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,840
but since

572
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,080
these were not in the data tracker yet

573
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,559
at the beginning of the meeting

574
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,080
they're not in the pre-loaded slides as

575
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,039
well

576
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,480
let's see if i can do something here

577
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,360
yeah can we ask um meet echo to uh to to

578
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,159
reload the pre-loaded slides and i want

579
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,919
to give rick a chance to go back to the

580
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,760
previous document and say a word while

581
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,120
we're waiting for that

582
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,679
uh he wrote a comment in uh in the chat

583
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,760
room which is kind of important i'd like

584
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,158
to give him a chance to uh to speak that

585
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,480
permissions can you hear me okay

586
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,440
yeah

587
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,000
okay very good thanks uh so yeah uh rick

588
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,559
wilhelm pr just for the

589
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,960
uh wearing my rdap working group chair

590
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,120
hat just letting everybody know what i

591
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,080
said in the in the uh in the chat there

592
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,880
that um the icann rdap working group is

593
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,200
working on modifying the i can rdap

594
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,320
profile

595
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,200
so that rdap responses

596
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,159
are allowed to use js contact and are

597
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,240
not required to use j card uh this will

598
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
probably make a lot of folks

599
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,120
in the room that are not big fans of jay

600
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,279
card pretty happy so we're allowing

601
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,760
flexibility there in the response

602
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
mechanism

603
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,919
and so we're kind of hoping that that

604
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,200
would it's not required that they use

605
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,360
js contact but it certainly allows that

606
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,679
optionality and so we'll we're hoping

607
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,120
that we're going to start to see some

608
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,360
variety and implementations and an

609
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,080
evolution in the uh in js content

610
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,840
implementation i'm probably going to

611
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,440
learn some things in that

612
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,640
and um

613
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,360
so

614
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,520
uh happy to take any questions about

615
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,640
that but and and also a lot of uh shout

616
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,640

617
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,039

and i now have uh thank you meat echo i

619
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,000
now have the the data dictionary slides

620
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,799
so

621
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,880
over to you guys

622
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,760
outstanding um so we're we're going to

623
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,400
assume that folks have had a chance to

624
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
read the data dictionary um jim could

625
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,360
you go to the next slide please

626
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,039
so when last we left our humble

627
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,200
explorers um uh since ietf 112 the draft

628
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,520
was accepted as a working group item

629
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,360
thank you all very much for that

630
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,679
uh for my own purposes of keeping track

631
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,760
of feedback i did go ahead and create a

632
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,080
github repository not suggesting

633
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
changing working group process on how

634
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,640
you normally handle drafts this was as

635
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,400
much for me personally as anybody else

636
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,760
but it's there

637
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
if anyone would like to

638
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,279
follow along if they would find that

639
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,600
easier

640
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,960
um what changes we've made

641
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,360
as as a result of the feedback that came

642
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
for the call to make this a working

643
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,880
group item we updated the abstract

644
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,559
one of the big points was we really

645
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,640
don't want to set policy with this draft

646
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
so we tried to make that clear

647
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,080
we updated several of the definitions to

648
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,679
remove the normative reference to the

649
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,840
epp

650
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,559
spec

651
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,600
the

652
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,919
general data element specification we

653
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,480
made a note that local interpretation is

654
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,880
expected for any any legal

655
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,120
issues and this this in no small part

656
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,600
touched on questions of you know legal

657
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,360
natural person what not what is what is

658
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,200
the local definition because the data

659
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
dictionary isn't trying to set that

660
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,240
there were several areas that could

661
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
inform policy just by how they were

662
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,919
defined

663
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,840
and for all of those we put the

664
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,399
definition to to be determined

665
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,679
we also did to be determined for um

666
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,679
any elements that that had questions

667
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,840
about what format are you choosing so

668
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,880
for like date or name or address

669
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,600
that's those are always sticky to to

670
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,279
define well so those are also tbd

671
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,240
and given the previous changes we moved

672
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,000
several items from

673
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,960
um

674
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,120
normative references to just informative

675
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,559
references

676
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,679
because they're they're no longer

677
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,720
fundamentally required

678
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,600
next slide please

679
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,360
there are a couple things that we were

680
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,080
able to just close in terms of uh

681
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,919
requests that people made

682
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:16,799
for

683
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,640
as part of the call for adoption one was

684
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,799
to change the title from the dns

685
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,960
registration uh dns data dictionary to

686
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,399
the registration data dictionary so

687
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,799
that's been done and the removal of the

688
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,279
references to epp so those two things at

689
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,000
least i created issues for them solely

690
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,440
so i could close them which felt really

691
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,399
good

692
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,918
i love checking things off the list

693
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,679
i

694
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,600
the github shouldn't be private i will

695
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,000
double check that as soon as i hand off

696
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,679
to steve

697
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,640
who gets the next slides

698
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
thank you very much heather

699
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,159
um

700
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,840
let me

701
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,880
just emphasize a pointer to

702
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,520
this work arose

703
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,880
out of

704
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,799
work that heather and i and others have

705
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,399
been involved in

706
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,000
where we realized that we were making

707
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,640
references or making lists of data

708
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,320
elements and that there are other places

709
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,159
in the ecosystem where there are

710
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,919
references to the equivalent data

711
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,919
elements and that there was no common

712
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,919
place to refer to those so this is sort

713
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,000
of a

714
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,600
an emergent uh aspect of the work and

715
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,679
the intent which i want to emphasize

716
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,919
very strongly is that this is not

717
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,760
intended to influence um any of the

718
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,440
substantive developments going on in

719
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,080
these areas it's simply an attempt to

720
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
gather the

721
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,039
terminology that's used and provided as

722
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,480
an available source of commonality

723
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,720
across the system

724
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,799
i know that's a question that keeps

725
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,399
coming up as to whether or not we're

726
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,600
trying to

727
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,200
change things that have been developed

728
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
or influence existing things so we're

729
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
just trying to put something on the

730
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,240
table that would be a useful building

731
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,399
block for either existing or future

732
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,320
systems and

733
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,440
of course we'll see how that goes so um

734
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,159
uh here's some of the comments that came

735
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:12,960
back

736
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
um

737
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,480
and and the first one i think i've just

738
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,240
spoken to that this documents various

739
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,200
terms but not expected necessarily to be

740
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,520
in complete agreement um that was a

741
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,600
suggestion so we'll see how this goes

742
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
but we've been trying to strip out any

743
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,120
of the things that are biased in one

744
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,080
direction or another

745
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,720
another concern is that definitional

746
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,880
nuances might be lost many words very

747
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
policy loaded can be difficult to

748
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,120
capture a standard definition for them

749
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,159
that's

750
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,559
true and will as i said we're trying

751
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,600
hard to

752
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,320
be as as neutral and as sort of vanilla

753
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,799
as possible in these definitions

754
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,240
um

755
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,080
a concern about whether there are

756
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,840
implied policy decisions um

757
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,519
the comment was it says it's merely a

758
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,799
dictionary but then it goes on to make

759
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,200
very clear policy decisions e.g and

760
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,600
section 2.30

761
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,039
and by defining elements

762
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,880
the existence of these fields as defined

763
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,720
by this data may create foundational

764
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,480
bedrock to build an argument

765
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,720
to support bi parties as to why in the

766
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,320
presence of the definition of fields the

767
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,919
information is not being captured

768
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,880
well um

769
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,399
i'm not sure what more i can say with

770
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,240
respect to the first of those things but

771
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,840
with respect to the second that's an

772
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
interesting

773
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,760
and

774
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,200
in some ways

775
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,440
a quite um

776
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,880
insightful

777
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,120
uh comment that just by putting those

778
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,799
definitions in there it provides

779
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,279
ammunition for parties who want to argue

780
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,519
well it's defined therefore it must be

781
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,480
used

782
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,840
um

783
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,519
no doubt there will be

784
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,120
instances of that kind of dialogue but

785
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,600
i hope we're making it clear in here

786
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,640
that

787
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,600
um

788
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,000
that is a separate and an explicit

789
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,519
decision that has to be made by each and

790
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,799
every group as to whether they want to

791
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,799
use those data elements and one of the

792
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,320
things that i think will

793
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,159
um

794
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,399
uh sort of make that case is that there

795
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,720
will be plenty of data elements

796
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,519
uh that are defined that simply will not

797
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,799
be used

798
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,399
it would be strong agreement not to use

799
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,559
it in a particular application

800
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,399
so i think that would be uh

801
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,399
it'll be easy to push back

802
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,399
in those situations where

803
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,240
um

804
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,440
somebody is trying to say well it's

805
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,039
there therefore you have to use it and

806
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,399
the answer is no it's got to be much

807
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,240
stronger than that

808
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,799
next slide please

809
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,880
jim

810
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,480
there we go

811
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,039
uh a question about the use of a label

812
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,919
formats uh international version uh u

813
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,840
label seems to be more inclusive

814
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,039
i

815
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,919
actually am going to punt

816
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:02,960
um

817
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,120
i remember listening to some discussion

818
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,840
about that but i realize i don't have

819
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,799
the

820
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,880
full picture of that there are some

821
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,720
others in the room here who might be

822
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,679
able to speak to that

823
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,200
feel free to speak or chat or whatever

824
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
and with respect to the second bullet is

825
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,559
the goal to describe the semantics of

826
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,279
daniel also specified syntax in the last

827
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,960
case we need to specify unicode

828
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,120
normalization so i would expect that

829
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,360
this will be come out in the back and

830
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,200
forth that we're going to have as we

831
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,320
move forward on all of this

832
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,320
nobody's speaking to the a label format

833
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,919
issue

834
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,559
next slide

835
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,000
i think i saw

836
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,880
in the queue

837
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,440
yeah jim gold had his hand up briefly um

838
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,640
but uh i i will also comment

839
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,440
that um the issue in in my mind about a

840
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,320
label versus you label is is just that

841
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,799
you probably have to have both

842
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,079
because

843
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,239
even in the gtld space where you get

844
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,480
policies from icann

845
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,599
they only apply at the tld level

846
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,159
and some limited application at the

847
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,760
second level but you can't control

848
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
anything else down the tree

849
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,560
so

850
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,040
you know those are just issues so you

851
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,199
probably have to have both

852
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,040
that's all

853
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,759
thank you and um

854
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,040
yeah it's james gould but we're trying

855
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,599
to see if his audio works can you try

856
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,240
again james

857
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,719
can you hear me this time yes we can

858
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,719
hear something we can hear some

859
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,079
something

860
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,960
yeah yeah i think kind of yell okay so

861
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,560
yeah no i actually want to speak to the

862
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,599
second bullet uh not the first one

863
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,440
um because i'm a little bit confused of

864
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,599
the purpose of this draft

865
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,400
because it has a mix of syntax some of

866
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,119
the data elements do some of them don't

867
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,599
and then if they do have data element

868
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,920
syntax definition

869
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,800
how do

870
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
what do we use that for

871
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,400
so if we're using these data elements

872
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,240
and the protocols they're not they may

873
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,599
not match

874
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,800
so is the intent to try to normalize the

875
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
syntax as well

876
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,560
in this draft

877
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,400
so my recommendation is to remove the

878
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,320
syntax and just make them data element

879
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,079
definitions

880
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,880
as opposed to trying to to mix it in so

881
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,920
just want to speak to that one

882
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,760
good comment

883
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,760
noted

884
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,119
i don't think we're going to resolve it

885
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,119
on the spot here but uh

886
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,920
we'll make a point of having uh some

887
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,440
dialogue on the um

888
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,000
on the mailing list

889
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,000
all right next slide

890
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,960
um

891
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,119
suggestion clarifying iana

892
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,960
considerations clarify that new data

893
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,560
elements will be created for use across

894
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,320
the entire domain system as opposed to

895
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
describing how specific data element is

896
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,760
populated for a given domain and i have

897
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,599
to add quickly that

898
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,839
we're although this arose out of work

899
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,200
that we're doing in the domain name

900
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,920
system it applies also to data elements

901
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,119
for uh address registrations and and

902
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,040
potentially for other situations so we

903
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,839
need to

904
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,160
um uh make that a bit clearer

905
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,800
word domain there might uh might seem

906
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,359
like it means domain names and i think

907
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,200
we'll we'll pull that out

908
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,919
a little bit

909
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,400
thank you

910
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,960
next slide

911
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,040
all right uh several next steps i need

912
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,079
text

913
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,880
oops what happened here

914
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,800
yeah sorry jim gold had his hand up and

915
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,240
i wonder if he took it down because we

916
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,040
changed slides

917
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,720
just wanted to be fair quickly

918
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,040
sorry about that

919
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,400
that's okay did you want to speak to

920
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,480
this

921
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,079
different issue i want to bring up um so

922
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,520
just trying to find the right time to do

923
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,240
it

924
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,560
thank you

925
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,440
oh wrong brother

926
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,079
yeah wrong button

927
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,280
just a moment

928
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,760
been there done that

929
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,440
yeah

930
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,400
and

931
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,920
there you go

932
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,400
excellent recovery

933
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,960
all right so a handful of next steps

934
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,160
obviously we want to uh

935
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,480
fill in the tbds

936
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,839
um

937
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,640
and identify any terms that are missing

938
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,640
although

939
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,200
my strong expectation is that this is a

940
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,000
live process that once we put this to

941
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,240
bed and and get the

942
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,800
registry up and running there will then

943
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,560
be

944
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
additional data items that will get

945
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,440
added

946
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
at some rate won't be it won't be a

947
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,359
torrent but uh might be a little trickle

948
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,280
but there will there will be ones queued

949
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,040
up and there have to be a process

950
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,400
assigned to that

951
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,960
and most important we need to document

952
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,720
shepard we need a volunteer

953
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,040
i don't see a whole bunch of hands going

954
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,110
up please please please

955
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,880
[Music]

956
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,839
we need we need somebody who serves the

957
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,680
proper role of a document shepard has

958
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,040
the right

959
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,599
time commitment neutrality

960
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,400
and insight

961
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,400
well if you don't volunteer we're going

962
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,560
to come around and

963
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,960
find you

964
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,520
and that's it

965
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,760
okay thank you steve and yeah what what

966
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,520
the documentary's concerns please

967
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,359
volunteer indeed and also on the mailing

968
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,440
list or or write directly to the

969
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,839
document authors or the chairs and uh we

970
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,040
can we can

971
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,720
make that happen

972
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,560
okay any questions i see james in the eq

973
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,440
go ahead james

974
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,480
uh yeah i have uh two uh items of

975
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,800
feedback one is

976
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,560
associated with the choice of the data

977
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,720
elements um since

978
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,640
i'm seeing new elements that i'm

979
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,960
unfamiliar with that are tbd

980
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,440
and i really don't see a large set of

981
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,560
data elements that exist in other rcs

982
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,960
related to registration data like the

983
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,560
data escrow

984
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,000
rfc so

985
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,160
it may be worthwhile to review those

986
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,240
rfcs and try to pull in data elements

987
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,200
that are applicable um a second item and

988
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,960
i i believe this also applies this is

989
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,280
what i was trying to say for the report

990
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,200
uh draft is

991
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,880
making sure that the data elements

992
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,000
follow a consistent naming convention

993
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,200
i'm seeing a mix of abbreviations versus

994
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,480
bars

995
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,359
uppercase versus lowercase um

996
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,040
i believe it would be good to formally

997
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,079
define

998
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,480
uh the the convention and to follow it

999
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,720
uh consistently in the draft

1000
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,480
that's it thank you

1001
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,640
those are two very very very very effort

1002
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,480
um

1003
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,599
it's certainly

1004
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,280
data elements that are defined in

1005
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,040
various rfcs

1006
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,640
we ought to include

1007
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,599
um

1008
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,440
there will be

1009
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,359
other data elements that are coming up

1010
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,359
in some of the work we're doing and

1011
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,800
other people's works that will not be

1012
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,040
familiar to everybody

1013
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,000
which is at least in part part of the

1014
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,720
motivation for this but

1015
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,160
with respect to covering those things

1016
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
that have been used in other documents

1017
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,720
that's an extremely good suggestion

1018
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,319
and on your other suggestion of uh

1019
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,160
using consistent

1020
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,280
naming

1021
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,359
and

1022
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,680
naming convention is is also quite

1023
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,598
appropriate so thank you for that

1024
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,440
okay

1025
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
thank you thank you chief

1026
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
gustavo

1027
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,880
you're next go ahead

1028
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,520
yeah can you hear me yeah

1029
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,599
wonderful things so i have two general

1030
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,000
opponents one is i mean as

1031
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,560
most of the participants in this group

1032
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,440
at some point in our careers we have to

1033
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,640
implement

1034
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,839
a registry or registration

1035
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,000
and over time i learned that

1036
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,280
i mean there are going to be conflicts

1037
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,119
because the risk is going to be dynamic

1038
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,960
obviously and then the contracts local

1039
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,520
law all of these things are also

1040
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,560
dynamic

1041
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,720
so i was wondering if

1042
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,440
that draft should say something like uh

1043
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,880
if there are some conflicts between

1044
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,440
definitions between local law contracts

1045
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,319
or policy and draft and the dictionary

1046
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,280
itself

1047
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,160
you need to go on and look for your own

1048
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,800
like legal advisor for any kind of help

1049
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,359
i mean i learned over my career uh that

1050
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,359
when there are conflicts i should try to

1051
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,960
go and look to the legal advisor of the

1052
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,400
company to understand

1053
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,920
what should i do right

1054
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,839
so it's kind of a suggestion just maybe

1055
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,480
say there that that is hey guys if you

1056
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,720
find in conflicts go on and find some

1057
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,160
kind of legal

1058
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,319
uh

1059
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,920
advice or

1060
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,440
something like that

1061
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,800
and the second comment is i think that

1062
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,000
the draft mentions there are 2.1 once

1063
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,800
the registry is available

1064
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,000
the definitions could change right

1065
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,960
so

1066
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,680
i think this is issues for some kind of

1067
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,800
versioning so it's a definition change

1068
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,960
it would be nice to know what was the

1069
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,200
definition at a certain point in time

1070
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,800
like at this point in time the decision

1071
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,720
was this and then

1072
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,480
on this specific point in time it

1073
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,400
changed to this other thing because that

1074
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,000
also could help in case there are some

1075
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,960
legal

1076
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,440
whatever things with you know with legal

1077
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,359
stuff

1078
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,440
so those are

1079
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,359
yeah very interesting are you suggesting

1080
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,119
that the registry should contain the

1081
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,520
history of the definitions

1082
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,640
uh even if they've changed over time

1083
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,440
yes

1084
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
i i think that's that's why what it's

1085
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,119
suggesting because normally when you go

1086
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,599
to an register you can see

1087
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,520
like the current version right that you

1088
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,760
don't have like a version i mean usually

1089
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,280
right i don't know if in the general

1090
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,040
street we have an example of

1091
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,119
array history with versioning but some

1092
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,640
kind of version it should be should be

1093
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,760
there or notes or something that says

1094
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,599
this change from this to this at this

1095
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,000
point in time

1096
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,079
yeah i understand what you're saying i

1097
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,520
don't have any

1098
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,160
direct experience with that uh in this

1099
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,960
context are there people is this come up

1100
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,880
in other situations where

1101
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,680
uh

1102
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,800
an iana registry

1103
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,960
has revision history

1104
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,240
as part of the registry

1105
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,520
surely there is someone who is expert

1106
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,640
and knows all of that

1107
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,640
well i i i wanted to make a comment and

1108
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,079
that is not

1109
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,240
much i had to opt for a moment but

1110
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,079
isn't it in the academic world the

1111
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,599
definition is supposed to be a

1112
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,599
definition and never changes anywhere in

1113
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,640
the future

1114
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,400
that's the definition of a definition

1115
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,119
well you wouldn't want it to change very

1116
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,400
often

1117
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,800
i see somebody at the queue in the room

1118
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,880
by the way but you have to register a

1119
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,400
new echo first before you can speak

1120
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,000
otherwise i cannot open the tube right

1121
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,680
um

1122
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,520
jim you're in the queue as well

1123
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,400
making a comment about this

1124
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,040
yeah um

1125
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,319
you know i i um

1126
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,640
i think you know in my mind as i think

1127
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,839
about this uh for this document

1128
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,079
um i don't know the answer specifically

1129
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,800
to what ayanna does i'm not aware

1130
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,359
personally of any history being

1131
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,000
maintained and i am a registry but i

1132
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,520
wouldn't consider myself an expert

1133
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,720
there's just way

1134
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,400
too much going on there so that's a

1135
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,640
question that we could certainly ask

1136
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,400
if we think it's useful

1137
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,000
what does occur to me though is that um

1138
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,520
there was a question earlier and i'm

1139
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,760
sorry i i forget who asked the question

1140
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,720
oh michelle is here um

1141
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,480
and she's saying in the chat room that

1142
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,160
there are examples of versioning within

1143
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,760
ayanna registries

1144
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,599
not many but she recalls a few she'll

1145
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,800
have to find some examples for us

1146
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,240
she's offering to do that which is very

1147
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,800
kind so thank you michelle for that but

1148
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,680
the other thing that occurs to me is um

1149
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,599
there's a question earlier steve i'm

1150
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,319
sorry i forget who asked the question

1151
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,280
uh

1152
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,960
but a a comment about uh whether or not

1153
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,280
uh there's any concern about

1154
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,160
um you know contracts and regulations

1155
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,920
and laws that might impact what a uh an

1156
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,920
element looks like and there was a

1157
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,560
related question about should we care

1158
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,560
more about the semantics or the syntax

1159
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,400
of the element seems to me this fits

1160
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,640
into the same category maybe it's

1161
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,640
appropriate to take a little bit of a

1162
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,480
step back here and just

1163
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,240
think about where we're trying to go

1164
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,839
with this document

1165
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,000
i shouldn't say we uh at the working

1166
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,680
group you know you where you want to go

1167
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,240
with this document and um uh and and um

1168
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,160
uh what you want to do there i i don't

1169
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,920
know if that's that's that's a proper

1170
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,119
thing to do

1171
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,000
um so i i just leave the question

1172
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,160
anyway thanks

1173
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,530
yeah thank you well um

1174
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,000
[Music]

1175
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,400
the devil's always in the details uh

1176
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,240
general attitude here is that we're not

1177
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,440
trying to

1178
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,960
um

1179
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,280
solve

1180
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,800
conflicts uh so much as provide common

1181
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,440
terminology where common terminology is

1182
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,480
sensible

1183
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,319
and then if there are

1184
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,560
uh issues about how it gets used or what

1185
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,800
it means or something that those get

1186
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,599
pushed up a level into the proper venues

1187
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:24,960
but not this one

1188
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,720
um

1189
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,640
and

1190
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,880
this this is intended to sit underneath

1191
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,800
if you will uh any debates about uh

1192
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,599
policy related things or

1193
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,400
legal issues

1194
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,000
but

1195
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,400
inevitably i can i can envision

1196
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,559
situations where

1197
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,319
the mere fact of trying to make the

1198
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,640
separation between what is commonly

1199
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,359
understood and aware of the local

1200
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,359
interpretations could lead to some

1201
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,839
interesting things for example

1202
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,160
and i'm just making this up as i go here

1203
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,079
pretty much um

1204
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,000
that

1205
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,480
if we ask um

1206
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,440
uh

1207
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,720
if we have

1208
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,400
there was a reference to a data element

1209
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,280
that defines whether or not the um

1210
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,440
the registration is for a legal person

1211
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,559
or for a natural person the uh a

1212
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,040
question that an attorney might ask is

1213
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,760
where is the jurisdiction for that for

1214
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,040
that uh

1215
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,720
decision that is uh legal versus natural

1216
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,480
in which jurisdiction

1217
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,960
and so one that might force the addition

1218
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,040
of yet another data element or some way

1219
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,680
of adding that to the uh to the

1220
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,760
dictionary

1221
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,520
in which case

1222
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,800
i would say

1223
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,200
this exercise turns out to be useful in

1224
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,200
bringing subtle things to the surface

1225
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,640
that are otherwise implicit

1226
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,839
but that's downstream a bit

1227
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,200
and i have to interrupt you here a bit

1228
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,960
steve because we're getting a little bit

1229
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,880
short on time we have three more people

1230
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,720
in the queue and we have one minute for

1231
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,680
them

1232
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,839
so

1233
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,119
go ahead if you can make it quick

1234
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,280
hello can you hear me

1235
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,720
yep

1236
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,559
perfect this is

1237
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,040
just following up on the

1238
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,200
the topic of this historical information

1239
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,079
or or on ayana registries

1240
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,440
one

1241
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,680
i guess not quite exactly and

1242
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,480
and

1243
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,960
in a registry but the idn

1244
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,400
repository

1245
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,800
the repository of item tables

1246
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,920
uses some form of

1247
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,480
tracking of historical versions

1248
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,400
considering that archived id and tables

1249
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,640
are also available

1250
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,000
as published by ayanna maybe that's one

1251
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,800
approach that can be seen as a one

1252
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,280
example

1253
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:55,359
okay next jonathan okay do you have any

1254
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,598
quick remark

1255
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,920
i do i think i muted myself can you hear

1256
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,280
me yeah

1257
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,839
perfect uh thank you so i have to put on

1258
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,599
my my hat as uh representing registrars

1259
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,559
uh inside the icann world despite my

1260
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,160
personal opinions about this i think is

1261
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,520
a good idea

1262
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,760
um there are some concerns about some of

1263
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,680
the fields being collected or how

1264
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,920
they're defined for the registrar

1265
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,280
information

1266
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,240
and

1267
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,280
uh

1268
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,559
the the hope was uh one

1269
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,880
that registrars um

1270
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,800
there's a lot of variation

1271
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,119
in what information may or may not be

1272
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,280
collected at registrars based upon their

1273
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,119
business model uh and the presence of

1274
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,480
fields um may beg the question among

1275
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,960
those who are data collectors

1276
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,839
as to why something maybe is or is not

1277
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,280
there among those who might request data

1278
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,040
that is

1279
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,400
where they're seeking to get all the

1280
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,720
data they possibly can

1281
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,480
and

1282
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,319
i think there's some some time and

1283
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,640
thought needs to be put into

1284
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,800
what what fields maybe

1285
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,400
should or shouldn't be there

1286
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,800
and and i'm just that's a collection of

1287
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,520
feedback from among registrars and again

1288
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,359
i'm i'm

1289
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,520
stating that out of responsibility

1290
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,440
despite maybe my personal feelings on

1291
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,160
that

1292
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,119
thank you

1293
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,559
yeah thank you jordan and just dip

1294
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,160
you have a comment go ahead and then

1295
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,760
steve can perhaps give a closing remark

1296
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,800
uh hi this is jasdeep singh erin

1297
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,480
so

1298
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,240
one suggestion um this is for steve and

1299
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,640
heather

1300
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,839
this is primarily right now sounds dnr

1301
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,119
centric

1302
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,160
but if you have rar side

1303
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,960
so

1304
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,319
one suggestion would be that the

1305
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,040
starting point could be

1306
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,960
this is just an input

1307
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,880
if you look at rdap

1308
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,160
that is one common protocol between dnrs

1309
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,920
and rars

1310
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,079
and it defines data structures pretty

1311
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,520
well

1312
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,000
covering the processes for both

1313
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,119
types of registries and of course

1314
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,119
epp then specializes that from the

1315
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,280
provisioning angle further so one

1316
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,440
suggestion would be that to help capture

1317
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,440
the right

1318
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,119
set of uh

1319
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,559
data elements

1320
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,720
that could be one of the good starting

1321
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,000
points

1322
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,480
so just wanted to suggest that

1323
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,559
especially

1324
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,079
thank you justin

1325
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,960

it would be better to

1337
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,760
leave the time

1338
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,800

this is a presentation about the recent

1350
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,599
document we have submitted

1351
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,599
as a joint proposal

1352
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:42,480
by

1353
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,839
dot it and dot pl

1354
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,720
a few introductory words about this

1355
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,319
document

1356
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,440
it doesn't aim to be a revolutionary

1357
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,960
proposal

1358
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,720
just aims to define the rules for

1359
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,400
implementing app over http

1360
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,200
next slide please

1361
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,079
uh

1362
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,599
what what

1363
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,119
could be the motivation of implementing

1364
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:16,480
fbp over http http is

1365
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,720
as

1366
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,920
is loosely coupled with the network so

1367
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,720
you don't have to deal with all the low

1368
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,760
level details typical of tcp programming

1369
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,680
it provides

1370
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,240
a well-known current server

1371
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,359
communication model that is supported

1372
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:38,640
by

1373
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,079
largely by

1374
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,040
all the

1375
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,079
platform software platform available

1376
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,640
it it's simple to

1377
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,480
its simplicity

1378
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,200
reduces the development time and

1379
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,839
it must be noted that

1380
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,680
most of the burden

1381
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,480
of

1382
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,000
handling

1383
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,760
the connection this the http session and

1384
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,760
the request and the responses is

1385
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,319
normally done by a an application server

1386
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,359
the

1387
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,400
with regard to this gap the speed gap

1388
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,799
between http and tcp

1389
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:21,280
http has become faster

1390
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,960
version vibration and now

1391
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,440
we can say that

1392
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,440
that gap is not so large as in the past

1393
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,200
about load balancing we can say that

1394
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,040
load balancing can be more easily

1395
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,119
implemented at uh

1396
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,079
lawyer 7 that at lawyer 4 because most

1397
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,040
of the load balancer uh

1398
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,760
our software are

1399
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,359
instead

1400
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,599
load balancer

1401
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,640
at lawyer 4 are more dependent on the

1402
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,240
hardware

1403
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,079
and as

1404
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,119
correctly pointed out by gavin in his

1405
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,960
feedback

1406
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,440
on the my little list

1407
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,240
if

1408
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,960
the migration to cloud is the future

1409
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,280
migrating an http server to cloud

1410
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,200
requirements effort then at ntcp server

1411
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,000
next slide please

1412
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,200
so

1413
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,960
how

1414
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,920
app messages are exchanged

1415
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,799
in this proposal the client must use the

1416
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,640
http post method tuition epp command

1417
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,280
and the server receiving a request

1418
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,480
returned the ppms the pp response in the

1419
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,079
response body

1420
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,440
setting the content length

1421
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,599
either to indicate

1422
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,880
the byte length of the entity body no

1423
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,520
message information uh

1424
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,599
must be issued

1425
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,480
through any other part of of the request

1426
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,720
or the response so there is a clear

1427
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,640
distinction between the application

1428
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,599
level

1429
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,040
and the

1430
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,960
transport level

1431
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,839
next slide please

1432
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:06,799
a

1433
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,079
session

1434
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,720
are implemented the epp sessions are

1435
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,280
implemented by using the mechanism

1436
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,520
described in rfc

1437
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,520
6265

1438
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,000
server receiving an epp logging

1439
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,160
must you

1440
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,079
common must use this set cookie

1441
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,280
responsibility to send a token also

1442
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,520
known as the session id

1443
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,920
uh that the client will will use to to

1444
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,920
in the future request

1445
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,440
in within the scope of the fpp session

1446
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,240
the name of the cookie attribute is not

1447
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,280
relevant

1448
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,079
and

1449
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,880
it depends on the implementation this is

1450
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,880
an example of

1451
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,079
a

1452
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,200
set cookie attribute setting

1453
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,400
the the session id and the use and the

1454
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,599
client server using this the session id

1455
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,119
in the in the

1456
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,040
subsequent request

1457
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,559
next

1458
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,559
slide please

1459
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,240
the session uh

1460
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,680
uh ended by the client uh by submitting

1461
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,720
the

1462
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,839
the

1463
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,839
the app logout command

1464
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,400
a self-receiving mpp logout command must

1465
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,359
end the ppp session invalidating the the

1466
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,040
session after having issued the response

1467
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,559
obviously

1468
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,720
a pc ep session

1469
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,680
that are considered the inactive for

1470
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,680
more than several that they find a

1471
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,960
period that

1472
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,000
can be ended by the server itself

1473
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,960
uh

1474
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,680
next slide please

1475
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,599
uh the command

1476
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:48,240
does not

1477
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,599
is the only common that can be issued

1478
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,079
outside in a pc an epp session together

1479
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,440
we obviously with the people login

1480
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,400
to start the session in such a case the

1481
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,880
service must return the greatest

1482
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,799
response without starting a session

1483
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,200
for example it can

1484
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,480
 no no cookie at all or it can

1485
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,640
return a inspired cookie

1486
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,680
obviously a client may issue the the low

1487
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,799
command

1488
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,839
within an ep session for example to keep

1489
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,760
it alive

1490
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,720
next slide please

1491
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,680
just to emphasize the

1492
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,760
clear distinction between the

1493
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,000
application lawyer and the

1494
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,200
transport lawyer there there is no mix

1495
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,839
between the

1496
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:47,119
return codes provided by http and epp so

1497
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,559
each http error codes must be used for

1498
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:55,359
signaling only http request failure

1499
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,839
and app error codes must be used for

1500
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:59,280
signaling app

1501
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,400
common failure so

1502
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,559
this means that the http retro code 200

1503
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,359
is used for both successful and

1504
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,799
successful

1505
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,559
epp requests

1506
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,480
next slide please

1507
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,480
we have one more minute mario

1508
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,359
okay

1509
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,920
we have two implementation they are

1510
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,760
stable they are

1511
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,240
live implementation they are they have

1512
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,760
been working for

1513
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,280
many years

1514
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,000
in more than a decade

1515
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,799
next slide please

1516
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,000
and

1517
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,280
two words about the security

1518
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,559
consideration

1519
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:41,359
http over tls must be used to protect

1520
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:45,359
sensitive information while in transit

1521
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:46,880
services are

1522
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,640
recommended to implement additional

1523
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,000
measure to verify the client

1524
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,760
there are some

1525
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,559
measures suggested in the slide

1526
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,440
service may require clients to present

1527
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,880
valid

1528
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,920
x

1529
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,040

digital certificate issued by recognized

1532
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,040
certification authority next slide

1533
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,040
please the final

1534
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,880
and there are some other

1535
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,280
possible

1536
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,200
additional

1537
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,680
security measures to protect to prevent

1538
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,920
the session id to be uh from being

1539
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,520
ejected and a

1540
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,359
service are finally recommended to

1541
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,240
control the number of simultaneous open

1542
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,880
ep session and http connection to

1543
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,160
mitigate

1544
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,920
the risk of

1545
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,280
resource starvation

1546
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,280
there is two other slides but i would

1547
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,079
like to stop here because they are about

1548
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,720
a lot balancing and the and this

1549
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,280
it is described in

1550
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,680
in an appendix of the document

1551
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,480
okay thank you mario we are waiting the

1552
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,440
final note sorry is that uh

1553
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,720
the authors would like

1554
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,319
to

1555
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,240
would like to ask the working group to

1556
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,480
consider this document

1557
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,119
for that option and then please take

1558
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,599
that to the mailing list mario of course

1559
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,480
okay yes

1560
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,520
yes so this is always from the speech

1561
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,799
registry

1562
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:36,240
i have a super minor command i i i think

1563
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,480
the document should be called epp over

1564
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,119
https

1565
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,640
and then

1566
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,240
to hd

1567
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,039
to https i want to say that the document

1568
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,680
should reference the uh

1569
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,400
for the security considerations from the

1570
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,359
security working group about which tls

1571
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,760
version to use and which tls ciphers and

1572
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,160
and so on because that

1573
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,920
i think is not an expertise of our

1574
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,839
working group

1575
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,599
and lastly i have the reference http 3

1576
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:08,960
in the document

1577
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,240
but http 3 allows you to

1578
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,480
basically have several sessions inside

1579
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,640
the same connection and something of

1580
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,240
that mapping

1581
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,160
would at least been

1582
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,359
talked about in the document

1583
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:25,680
okay thank you

1584
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,400
uh gavin

1585
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,400
yeah thank you kevin brown centronic um

1586
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,599
all right already said what i said

1587
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,920
wanted to say about http 3's streams but

1588
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,440
i did want to note

1589
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,839
in security considerations um

1590
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,799
it makes uh the the the draft makes um

1591
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,119
ip based access control a mutual tls

1592
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,400
optional which is a regression from

1593
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,319
the the current specification for a bpp

1594
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,799
over tcp or opp over tls where they are

1595
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,599
mandatory i think i've no particular

1596
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,920
objection to that but i think it needs

1597
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,880
to be noted in the draft that the the

1598
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,200
the term there is a difference there in

1599
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,319
the security profile of the two

1600
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:05,359
different transport protocols

1601
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,160
okay thank you gavin

1602
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,400
and then final remark from jim jin go

1603
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,520
ahead

1604
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,520
thank you antoine the far too many gems

1605
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,680
in this working group

1606
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,760
my name is jim reed

1607
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,200
i'm

1608
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,920
just violently opposed to cookies in any

1609
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,000
possible shape or form i just don't like

1610
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,920
them and i don't understand why you

1611
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,760
would need to complicate

1612
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,760
the session for an app with having

1613
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,039
cookies in there and deal with the

1614
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,280
issues of stale cookies and refreshing

1615
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,960
cookies and all that stuff why not just

1616
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,960
to limit that what benefit do we get for

1617
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,240
an epp session that has cookies i don't

1618
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,038
see the need for it

1619
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,039
can i answer

1620
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,039
yes you can now

1621
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,720
firstly i would like to answer to rick

1622
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,039
we

1623
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,000
decided the title of the

1624
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,760
document uh that is

1625
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,680
compliant to the the name of uh

1626
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,839
rfc

1627
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:10,720
uh 57

1628
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,350
34 so

1629
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:13,680
[Music]

1630
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,240
the name of that document is

1631
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:21,039
app over tcp no not over tls so

1632
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,359
in the same way

1633
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:24,960
i i

1634
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,640
i i entitled the the document app over

1635
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,799
uh app over http and on and not or app

1636
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,839
over

1637
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:39,200
https but in the document is stated that

1638
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,920
tls is required so

1639
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,359
why we use

1640
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:50,920
the cookies because we adopt a

1641
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,720
standardized

1642
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,319
method to

1643
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,000
map a

1644
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,640
an applicative an application an

1645
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,440
application session to a

1646
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,960
an http session this is the

1647
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,559
the the the

1648
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,640
standard the way

1649
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,359
we adopt

1650
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:18,038
we have been adopting for many years so

1651
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,000
there is no way there's no problem in

1652
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,319
refreshing the cookies because it's

1653
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:27,200
something that uh

1654
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,039
libraries supporting http requests and

1655
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,280
responses and sessions

1656
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,079
are

1657
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,119
accustomed to to to manage so

1658
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,680
you don't need to

1659
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,960
make

1660
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,400
to to implement

1661
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,280
nothing party nothing special because uh

1662
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,400
you you

1663
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,359
need only for for the client for example

1664
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:52,400
to

1665
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,200
enable cookies management

1666
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,799
and that's it so uh

1667
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,599
i i think that this is a a

1668
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,240
a simple way to

1669
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,400
to to manage a

1670
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,119
session for for for an fpp client

1671
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,480
in the sake of time we really have to

1672
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,799
close here um in the form of cookies you

1673
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,039
know just because people are standardly

1674
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,720
using it doesn't mean that it's good to

1675
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,680
use them so we may take that discussion

1676
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,440
on the mailing list jim because we're

1677
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,039
really running out of time where 10

1678
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,760
minutes later okay thanks mario

1679
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,880
yeah

1680
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,240
um and with that we come to the end of

1681
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,440
our agenda if there are no any other

1682
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,359
business this is a last call for any

1683
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:40,960
other business if we can do it in one

1684
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,839
minute

1685
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,079
and i don't see any hands

1686
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,760
and with that i think

1687
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,599
we ran a little bit over time that was

1688
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,960
not expected but it was a good session

1689
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,359
uh see you all on the mailing list and

1690
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:00,160
let's continue the discussions there and

1691
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,200
with that i adjourned this meeting thank

1692
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,280
you all and thank you for who was taking

1693
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,000
the minute jim

1694
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,839
um there are a variety of people rick

1695
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,000
and i brick wilhelm and i were mostly

1696
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
putting notes in the in the chat in the

1697
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
