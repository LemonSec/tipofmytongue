12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,480
hey good morning guys can you hear my

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,280

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,160
yes yes yes works

15
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,719
let's give it one more minute and then

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,120
let's get started

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,240
so

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
okay let's get started so we are like

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,240
one minute past 10 so this is

20
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
one minute past

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
10 o'clock

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,439
so let's get start with our session here

23
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,759
so we have a two hour slot and the

24
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,079
agenda is you know reasonably lightly

25
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,920
populated

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,000
so i think we have enough time for q a

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,479
if that actually is necessary

28
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,479
and

29
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,440
yeah so

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,878
as you can see also you know there's

31
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,560
like nobody sitting in the front due to

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
unforeseen circumstances

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,319
uh it is unfortunately you know the way

34
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,720
it is right now uh luckily you know

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,120
beyond the initial hiccup of meat eco

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
you know having a small issue that

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
actually has been fixed now also so i

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,720
think you know everything is ready to

39
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,840
to to go as such

40
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
so welcome all to

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,920
link state vector routing

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,680
working

43
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,800
uh

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
first some administrivia so this is the

45
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,319
noteworld you probably have seen it

46
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,640
already right i know by now

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,519
and it just says like you know that

48
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,640
you know if you're participating into

49
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,879
the itf and whatever you say as wondrous

50
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,480
like an ipr

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,920
relationship here you have to take that

52
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,519
to be into account

53
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,080
now in addition to that uh there is also

54
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,239
some anti-harassment procedures and code

55
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,400
of conduct so be friendly be kind be

56
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
nice

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
and don't make communication you know

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,640
discussions like personal but keep it on

59
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,799
topic uh on a technical level

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
also for meeting tips and this is

61
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,120
especially you know important now

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
maybe not so much because we only have

63
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,640
like three people in the room i believe

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
so if you wanna you know uh ask a

65
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
question you know use the tools and then

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
you know we will be able to

67
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,640
grant you access to the microphone

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,959
through the remote access tools via from

69
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,159
from the chairs

70
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,000
if you're local just hit the little

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,440
thingy here you know what you can see on

72
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,599
the right hand side and then you will be

73
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,360
able to get into the queue through that

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,680
channel

75
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,120
so we also have a few interesting links

76
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
as you can see uh you probably have seen

77
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
them already and you know these are just

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,360
reference in here i'm gonna go on

79
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
further

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,959
so for the rest uh so for the javascript

81
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,720
we have a jabber you know tool so

82
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,760
because

83
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,400
mid echo is directly integrated with it

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
uh for minutes uh victor is going to

85
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
take care of that one

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,920
and

87
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
then let's go towards the agenda of what

88
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,040
we have

89
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
so as i mentioned so we have a

90
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
reasonably light agenda and we have like

91
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,160
a long

92
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
time schedule planned you know ahead of

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,720
us

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,440
we have three uh draft topics to talk

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,320
about

96
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
uh first is the lsvr flute reduction

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,960
work which is you know being you know be

98
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,400
reintroduced again

99
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,440
and then we have uh two drafts

100
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
from randy

101
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,600
which are speaking of you know uh like

102
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
l3dl but then over uh layer 3

103
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
technology itself

104
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,720
the first two topics so for the next

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,160
step so where are we with the working

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,479
group itself and with our work so

107
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,720
so finally you know we were able to

108
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,440
request the iana code points for our

109
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,840
main specification draft it has been

110
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,280
reviewed and it actually has been

111
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,360
re-edited also

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
uh we are now at dash of

113
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,240
version 16 and i believe this is ready

114
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,199
to go towards iesg if i'm not you know

115
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,840
incorrect is that correct uh victor

116
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
okay it's probably not connected on the

117
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,039
mic

118
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,520
yeah that's correct

119
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,639
okay

120
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,560
yeah yeah so so we'll be doing that you

121
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,320
know very shortly so it took you know a

122
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,240
lot longer than as anticipated for

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
getting to the core points

124
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
mainly because you know the chairs you

125
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,039
know had to figure out how to request

126
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,560
those things so that took more time than

127
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,479
anticipated so sadly enough but we are

128
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,479
there now and the draft is ready it has

129
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,240
been reviewed a few times so we believe

130
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
it is reasonably uh okay you know it is

131
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,919
actually in a good shape

132
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,320
and then the other thing what we were

133
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
what we discussed already during the

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,880
previous ietf meeting is we will have to

135
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,400
reshorter the the svr working group

136
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
and we had to wait upon

137
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
the moment we could you know submit or

138
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
finalize our prime draft here the bgp

139
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
spf and ship it towards iesg so that we

140
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,520
actually have our work you know our main

141
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,120
work item finished from the working

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
group and that could actually kick off

143
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,080
then like a reshorter of the lsvr

144
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
charter itself

145
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,400
and the main goal would be to actually

146
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,800
include the l3dl work as formal entities

147
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,639
of the working group itself so this is

148
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,800
this you know this discussion we will

149
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
actually kick off you know starting from

150
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,479
next week and we will start you know

151
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,120
discussing like you know what and how

152
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,199
the new charter is going to be and then

153
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,199
check with the working group you know if

154
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,720
there's like interested people on that

155
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
one and

156
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,319
and to form you know the the correct

157
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,960
text for that

158
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,400
any questions on that or remarks

159
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
otherwise we will move towards you know

160
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,080

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
at first i would like to thank ac

173
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
video the donut for their valuable

174
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
comments and suggestions to the draft

175
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,840
we made

176
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,360
some changes to the previous version

177
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,160
firstly we simplified the

178
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,520
draft

179
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,400
through removing a complicated option

180
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
which is called

181
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
the group option

182
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,560
from the

183
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,400
rr model

184
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,759
and then some editorial changes

185
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,319
next page

186
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,199
so this is the current

187
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,720
simplified

188
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,479
revised floating

189
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,759
procedure

190
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,800
in root reflector model

191
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
so basically

192
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
basically

193
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,720
bgp spf speaker

194
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,479
will send

195
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,000
it linkers

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,680
linked information

197
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,159
to one or two neutral reflectors even

198
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,958
though we have a multiple root root

199
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,519
reflectors in the network

200
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,360
after receiving

201
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,640
the link state

202
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,519
the router reflector

203
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
will just send

204
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
the links to the information to the

205
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,880
other bgp speakers

206
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,200
so this is simple for example in the

207
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,160
network here we have two root reflectors

208
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,760
r1

209
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,600
and r2

210
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,399
we have number of nodes a b c and d in

211
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,000
the network

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
node a

213
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
will just send

214
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,480
its link states

215
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,440
to one neutral reflector

216
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,920
r1 it will now send

217
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,480
its link states to

218
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,320
rr2

219
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,519
after receiving the link state from

220
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,600
node a

221
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,399
r1 will send the link states to the

222
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,279
other

223
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,000
bgp spf speakers so this is symbol

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,839
and also

225
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,200
the link states flooding is reduced

226
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,760
next page

227
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
the revised flooding procedure

228
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,959
in load of connection model is not

229
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,160
changed in the draft so this is

230
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,519
procedure

231
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,959
is similar

232
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,240
to the one

233
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
in the igb flooding reduction

234
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,480
so every node

235
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,519
has a flooding topology in the network

236
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,320
and then every node will send the link

237
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
states information

238
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,760
to

239
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
its peers

240
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
on the flooding topology

241
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,560
so for example we have a real network

242
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,920
on the right

243
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,800
and and we have flooding topology

244
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
on the left

245
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
node a

246
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,760
will only send new states information

247
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,640
to

248
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,079
its peers

249
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,880
on the flooding topology

250
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,320
so for example node a will only send

251
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,079
unique states

252
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,360
to

253
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,720
node b

254
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
and then node b

255
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
which are on the flying topology node a

256
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,880
will now send the link states

257
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,320
to note the c even though node c is

258
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,800
appear of node a on the real topology

259
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
but the node c is not

260
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,040
here of node a on the flying topology so

261
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,839
in this way we

262
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,120
reduce the link status lighting in the

263
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
network

264
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,920
so next page

265
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,920
so i think that's all i think for uh

266
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,279
right now

267
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,920
the flooding

268
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,200
reduction

269
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,160
is simplified in the current draft

270
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
and also we would like

271
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,040
comments

272
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,000
and also looks like the draft is

273
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,720
simplified and stable stable and i would

274
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,760
also like

275
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,519
adoption course if possible thank you

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,240
so any any questions

277
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,560
towards jaimo

278
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,359
or on his work

279
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,160
alvaro

280
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,600
uh hi alberto um

281
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,040
i hate to say this but i haven't read

282
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,399
the draft

283
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,040
um i'm assuming the draft talks about

284
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,800
how

285
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,320
in the round reflector case you select

286
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
one reflector over the other

287
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
and how the second route reflector

288
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,320
eventually gets the state gets the

289
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
routes right so because if there's a

290
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,880
failure

291
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,320
and you only send the rods in one place

292
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,680
in one direction then you're screwed

293
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,720
right

294
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,839
um

295
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,760
and i'm assuming the draft also talks

296
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,200
about how you select the floating

297
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,959
topology

298
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,839
yes yes that's right those details uh

299
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,240
already in the draft for example

300
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,800
for selecting the rotary reflector

301
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,279
so we can select the

302
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,040
the

303
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,519
root reflector with a

304
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,360
minimum id

305
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,240
those

306
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,600
details is in the draft

307
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,040
yes thank you thank you for your

308
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,040
comments

309
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
any other questions from people in the

310
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,040
room

311
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,000
or remote

312
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,519
okay so hi mo so i think one of the

313
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,880
questions you put here on this slide

314
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,200
also isn't always about adoption now

315
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
frankly i think it is you know it's a

316
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,720
bit early on that you know before we

317
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,480
adopt you know this kind of work i would

318
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,639
like to see some discussion actually on

319
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,000
the email list

320
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
about this and and to get the sense you

321
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
know of the people who are going to be

322
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,399
contributing to the document you know in

323
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,560
the future you know if they find it like

324
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,360
you know

325
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
if it is like something

326
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,279
that they find useful or necessary for

327
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,079
this particular environment

328
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,360
you know

329
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,720
just basically to see like you know more

330
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
discussion on the working group list at

331
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
all because i think you know in the last

332
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,839
three or four or five months actually

333
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,199
you know the communication has been

334
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,440
reasonably light so i think you know if

335
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,120
you would launch a question it probably

336
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,480
will trigger like lots of people you

337
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,839
know paying attention and giving you

338
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,399
feedback on where to go and how to do it

339
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,920
and and if not at least you know it's

340
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
actually a first step into the direction

341
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,519
of you know

342
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,120
for for having the group working on this

343
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,839
particular work item

344
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,720
okay yeah okay thank you

345
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,399
okay then let me jump to randy's slide

346
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,880
you have anything else to say victor for

347
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,199
about this

348
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,720
mission thank you

349
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,519
okay

350
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,680
okay randy you have full control of the

351
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,839
deck

352
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,160
hey hey gunter

353
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,120
yes

354
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,959
i got in the queue late this is a c

355
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,959
lindem cisco systems i was just gonna

356
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,399
say in terms of the wemo draft

357
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,320
i i've i've read it uh briefly i haven't

358
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,839
gone through all the

359
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,920
corner cases but we always we always

360
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
implied that we could do this but we you

361
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,199
know we kept it out of the base

362
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,839
specification so it's in line

363
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,079
with our work

364
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,120
i mean

365
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,720
that you you you could reduce the

366
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,199
flooding

367
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,000
and set it without a scope in the base

368
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,920
specification so i think it it's

369
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,959
definitely in the scope of work

370
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,959
okay cool thank you

371
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,518
okay thank you

372
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,519
okay

373
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,360
this draft

374
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,160
um excuse me this was has not been

375
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,199
customized for lsvr

376
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,000
when

377
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,839
idr

378
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
working group

379
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,320
looked at l3dl

380
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,160
they said hey

381
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,680
how about also a layer 3 solution

382
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,759
so this is

383
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,519
a cousin of l3dl

384
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,160
customized for

385
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,720
idr

386
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,560
discovery egp discovery in the data

387
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,759
center

388
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,639
it's

389
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,720
really two drafts

390
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
the usual suspects

391
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,480
it's attempting to be very boring

392
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,680
and uh

393
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,839
one bit of philosophy throughout is

394
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,240
it's not probabilistic

395
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,680
right you'll see everything is lockstep

396
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,120
and

397
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,399
you know it immediately switches to

398
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,160
hopefully tls but at least tcp etc

399
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,800
for just dead lock step reliable

400
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,199
protocols

401
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,480
okay

402
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,560
it's like l3dl except it's layer 3.

403
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,440
the pdus will look very familiar to you

404
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,320
it

405
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,160
uses one

406
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,440
udp multicast hello for initial

407
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,600
discovery

408
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,279
and that's to find candidates

409
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,639
for

410
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,240
establishing real tcp

411
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,040
it's session oriented and resumable like

412
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,199
l3dl

413
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,679
there's no retransmission needed because

414
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,799
tcp does all that

415
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,400
it keeps the minimal needed state

416
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,039
so it's not re-transmitting it's not

417
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,480
refreshing

418
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,039
the ends are supposed to remember what

419
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,319
they're doing

420
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,559
and the protocol only sends changes

421
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,400
due to the fact that it's over tcp tls

422
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,960
it's reliable in order delivery etc

423
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,799
okay

424
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,200
the goal is to find neighbors learn the

425
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,080
i

426
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,960
layer three addressing and bootstrap bgp

427
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,039
same as before we go through l

428
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,760
you'll notice little stars once it has

429
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,200
discovered the affy saffies

430
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,799
there's a little star in the blue up

431
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,799
arrow because it doesn't have

432
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,720
7752

433
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,960
um bgpls

434
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,000
communication to bgp

435
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,919
um there's some discussion of that going

436
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,760
on in idr

437
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,720
the feeling seems to be that

438
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,600
um it's that happens all under the table

439
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,840
inside the implementation

440
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,919
i have some questions about that which

441
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,039
i'll say for the end

442
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,080
remember this isn't a routing protocol

443
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,600
it's just to discover layer 3 addresses

444
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,678
on point-to-point and multi-point

445
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,120
type

446
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,559
length

447
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,600
value

448
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
one-on-one

449
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,160
um we've got version number in here

450
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,240
there's a change

451
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
um

452
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,480
this is the udp hello

453
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,200
it's about to change because discussion

454
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,120
in idr

455
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,000
the flags is to say hey

456
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,600
what flavor connection do you want tcp

457
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
or tls

458
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,080
self-signed or ca based certificates

459
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,520
this should really be an enumeration

460
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,799
which is raw tcp

461
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,919
tll tls sell signed

462
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,720
tls ca based

463
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,919
and what really should be there is

464
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,679
tls ca based with address

465
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,480
in the certificate so it's locked to an

466
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,240
address

467
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
um there's a port in there in the hello

468
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,799
just in case you wanna

469
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,120
didn't like the iana assign port

470
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,720
the tls

471
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,160
session

472
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,840
is opened

473
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,640
by

474
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
the hello peer

475
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,440
with the lowest ip address

476
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,520
the highest address acts as a client

477
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
there's some discussion of how this is

478
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,280
handled

479
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,880
in an

480
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,080
internet exchange that has route servers

481
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,360
two comments about that so far is one

482
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
that wasn't in the goal set this is for

483
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,440
a data center

484
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,400
and two

485
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,679
is

486
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,120
that

487
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,640
all the route servers i know and i do

488
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
actually run routers that are on

489
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,760
exchanges are at the lowest addresses

490
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,360
so just don't field a server

491
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,480
and

492
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,159
you'll connect to the route servers

493
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,039
tls the hello set whether it's ca based

494
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,200
or self-signed

495
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,760
if it's self-signed we call this trust

496
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,440
on first use

497
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,360
i jokingly call it married on first date

498
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,880
um you've seen

499
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,520
it's gone out of fashion thank you

500
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,200
to lessen crypt and free certificates

501
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
but um you

502
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,440
certainly remember browser saying i

503
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,120
don't know the certificate do you want

504
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,679
to trust it anyway etc etc

505
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,919
so it's believed without question by the

506
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,039
client

507
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,600
you do get integrity because you've got

508
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,360
tls

509
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,400
and

510
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,960
if you disconnect and reconnect you know

511
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,480
you're reconnecting to the same attacker

512
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,960
if that is satisfied

513
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,159
um

514
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,520
in general

515
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,880
we expect ca-based keying

516
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,039
which is enrolled

517
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,720
in

518
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,840
a certificate

519
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,720
authority and

520
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,520
the server must use the cert

521
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,200
and the client

522
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,640
therefore can

523
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,760
check that the cert from the server

524
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
is indeed signed

525
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,240
because it has it's been provisioned

526
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,400
with the public

527
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,760
key of this

528
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,159
trust anchor

529
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,120
okay

530
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,919
and they're actually

531
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,320
um we won't go into detail here

532
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,159
but you can find it in rpki

533
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,120
um router certificates there are two

534
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,039
modes of enrolling

535
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,159
one is self-generated on the router

536
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,640
and the other is generated in the ca

537
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,120
okay the choice of which

538
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,479
is for the operator

539
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,440
so

540
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,120
you now have a tls or tcp session

541
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
and you wish to have

542
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,240
an l3 neighbor discovery session within

543
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,320
it

544
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,799
there's a session id

545
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,559
which is a nonce

546
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,919
that identifies the session that will be

547
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,960
there

548
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,600
and it's the same session

549
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,960
until something bad happens

550
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,280
there's a serial number in each of the

551
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,440
data pdus

552
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,559
it's think of it as a checkpoint

553
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,360
that

554
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,240
if you decide to restart

555
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,720
you can tell your friend hey

556
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,280
i've still got the same session id can

557
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,520
we resume from this serial number please

558
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,679
and then there's a miscellaneous

559
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,720
collection of attributes um

560
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,240
in this case we're suggesting

561
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
to not have predetermined attributes but

562
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
leave that entirely up to the act the

563
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,158
operator

564
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,760
okay

565
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,320
all pdus are acknowledged

566
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,880
the acknowledgement is either of e-type

567
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
0 there was no error and you're all

568
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,840
happy

569
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,480
or

570
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,360
air actual errors and the errors can be

571
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760
of various severities

572
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,080
and there's an error code in their hint

573
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,880
that

574
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,960
look a lot like

575
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,120
smtp errors and browser errors etc

576
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,439
with a code and a further sub code

577
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,720
okay

578
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,520
so it's fully stateful

579
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,000
it's a session prepare

580
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,960
it does have restart it can be resumed

581
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,000
um

582
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,440
one of the co-authors is

583
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,200
a major bgp freak so he

584
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,440
manages to argue for

585
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,520
all these bgp like features

586
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,480
okay

587
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,440
so i want to tell you what ipv4

588
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,679
addresses i have

589
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,200
and as i said there's a serial number

590
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,320
and then there's a count of the ipv4

591
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,480
addresses

592
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,120
and for each one

593
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,880
there's the address and the prefix

594
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,000
length but there's also flags

595
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,799
am i announcing or withdrawing that v4

596
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,559
address

597
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,559
is it a primary or secondary

598
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,120
is it under layer overlay

599
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,679
is it a loopback

600
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,880
there can be more reserved at the moment

601
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
so for instance

602
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,640
you might have a fee for encapsulation

603
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,760
pdu

604
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,279
that says here's my primary address and

605
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,480
here's a loopback address

606
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,559
and if later

607
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,080
this system says hey peer and peers peer

608
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,159
with the following address and it hands

609
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,320
you the loopback address

610
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,039
you know to forward through the primary

611
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,360
okay

612
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,279
of course there's ipv6 and mplsv4 and v6

613
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,120
so now we want to communicate

614
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,239
bgp stuff

615
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,679
it's meant for arbitrarily or above

616
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,480
layer 3 protocol so far only defined for

617
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,039
bgp

618
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,880
there's a pdu

619
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,840
upper layer

620
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,960
protocol configuration

621
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,039
it's only defined for bgp

622
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,480
and then it has

623
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,840
a list

624
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,679
of sub tv tlvs with the count of the

625
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,640
elements in that list

626
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,720
the idea is still to provide the

627
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,200
absolute minimal set of configuration

628
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,400
parameters for bgp open to succeed you

629
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,720
don't want to duplicate what's going to

630
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,799
be in bgp open

631
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,360
because multiple sources of truth are a

632
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,720
rep recipe for death

633
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,840
okay

634
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,039
so

635
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,080
what's my asn

636
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,000
what's my ipv4 peering address

637
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,880
of course there's a v6 version too

638
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,600
that prefix length is an error it has to

639
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,799
be removed because it's just the address

640
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,799
you know the prefix length

641
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,679
from

642
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,720
the base pdu

643
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,840
okay

644
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,960
there's authentication data

645
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,320
and there's

646
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,279
whether you have gtsm ttl check

647
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,240
and that's all you really need

648
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,960
of course there's one for an ipv6 period

649
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,760
even though

650
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,120
the bgp sec says that the same asn2

651
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,520
devices can only have one pairing

652
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,360
thanking robert who's

653
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
reminded me of this

654
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,960
hidden fact

655
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,880
um practices they actually do so you can

656
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,000
set up a v6 and a v4 appearing with the

657
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,240
same pdu

658
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,960
remember that the base protocol provided

659
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,440
marked loopbacks

660
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,960
so

661
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
are these features or bugs i think it's

662
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,600
a matter of taste it's state stateful

663
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,520
and restartable

664
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,760
it's rigid and has handshakes and pacing

665
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,320
solid confirmation

666
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,640
it's got tcp

667
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,960
it's a based over tcp

668
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,039
if you have bgp you have tcp

669
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,480
you may not have tls though i think any

670
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,200
modern device certainly probably does

671
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,399
but if you're rolling out a data center

672
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,720
i would think you've got it but

673
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,679
you know you don't have to

674
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,399
if you want security do you roll your

675
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,200
own or shut up and use tls

676
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,440
in the security world rolling your own

677
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
security

678
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,960
is a

679
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,080
obscene statement

680
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,960
okay

681
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,200
it provides large-scale property

682
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,840
mortgage bgp

683
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,120
needs um the thought is for evpn

684
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,080
but

685
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,840
the scaling

686
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,520
really if you're not using it only costs

687
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,120
a few bits in the length fields

688
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,279
you don't actually have to

689
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,440
fill 3 000

690
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,200
sub pdus

691
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,039
you just have to

692
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,120
allow the length field to be big enough

693
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,679
to handle it

694
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,600
that's pretty much it

695
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
except

696
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,600
i have some questions and issues that we

697
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
discussed in idr and they're still

698
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,200
interesting

699
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,480
how are parameters passed

700
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,399
to bgp

701
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,480
okay and lsvr

702
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,080
i think it's bgpls but an idr

703
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,720
you see the implementers say hey that's

704
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,279
my business it's under the table

705
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,559
my bgp speaks to my discovery

706
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,799
you don't tell me how to do it

707
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
but the question still stands how has

708
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,559
bgp started restarted and stopped

709
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,640
what's the timing how do we communicate

710
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,919
that

711
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,600
a friend have said hey pack it all in

712
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,559
one

713
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,640
ulp cpdu

714
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,559
when that pdu's received you have all

715
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,120
the parameters you need start the sucker

716
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,679
if you receive another restart it

717
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,840
uh he hasn't said how it stopped

718
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,720
when is discovery finished

719
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,960
and when should it be stopped

720
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,520
should it be stopped

721
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,200
right if you're on

722
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,440
multipoint you probably want to keep

723
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,679
going with the hellos because no

724
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,279
somebody new can come on

725
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,080
okay is the restart ability really

726
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,399
needed

727
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,919
and that's my deck

728
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,039
questions

729
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,918
do i see snow out the window

730
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,080
hey gunter i don't know if you can see

731
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,320
the queue

732
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,000
hi ac just talk

733
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,720
okay ac linda my cisco systems um

734
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,600
sorry

735
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,080
the first the first comment i had was

736
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,559
you were talking about forwarding you

737
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,640
envisioned this protocol actually

738
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,120
installing routes to get it to the

739
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,279
loopback address or do you see that to

740
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,240
be

741
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,039
the under the un under the purview of

742
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,480
the clients of this protocol like for

743
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,159
example

744
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,480
the latter

745
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,640
okay so it it it's like it's like lldp

746
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,240
discovery where we said we weren't going

747
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,720
to install the route okay

748
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,200
uh the second comment

749
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
i had is

750
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,960
that

751
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,640
on this last

752
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,519
page a lot of times

753
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,559
like for instance if you look at other

754
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,360
protocols that give hints

755
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,159
uh

756
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,440
to the

757
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,279
it's it's a hint

758
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,640
and you would never stop

759
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
a protocol based on the discovery

760
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,799
protocol once you start a session

761
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,960
it's up to the it's it's up to that

762
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,559
protocol like for instance a good

763
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,559
example of this of course it's not used

764
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,559
it's used for liveliness detection not

765
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,360
for discovering the parameters is bfd

766
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,559
so

767
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,440
if uh

768
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,000
well i mean

769
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,519
just because you

770
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,880
you just yes will be be a bfd that

771
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,120
doesn't mean you you would stop it right

772
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,080
if

773
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,960
you

774
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,000
okay yeah yeah yeah which is why this is

775
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,360
a question

776
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,320
right yeah remember this was from idr

777
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,120
here okay yeah right right

778
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,760
here you've got bgpls so they can they

779
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,240
have a signaling protocol which they can

780
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,559
use to argue right i mean the way i see

781
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,320
all these discovery protocols the

782
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,960
parameters change it's not compatible

783
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,440
with the current session there's

784
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,200
something that needs to be done the

785
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,360
capabilities need to be renegotiated

786
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,279
based on those it's up to be it would be

787
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,159
up to bgp to to stop or restart the

788
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,840
session that's the way i see it anyway

789
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,360
thanks ace

790
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,039
and me also you know but then

791
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,120
as one of the contributors

792
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,880
so

793
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,720
so something what we see also in the igp

794
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,360
world when doing discoveries is there is

795
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,200
an exchange of like you know interest

796
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,440
for doing like street bgp so

797
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,720
you know there have been some extensions

798
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,559
in the hello you know

799
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,159
the ways of doing like discovery that

800
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,679
the note actually is capable of doing

801
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,320
the you know of bfd itself so from the

802
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,159
moment the decision is built up

803
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,240
that's only done you can actually start

804
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,880
up the bgp or the ics or the ospf and

805
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,279
then do a fast fail it actually fails so

806
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,200
is that something you know which you

807
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,600
intend to include in this also you know

808
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,399
to

809
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,199
advertise a preference that bfd has to

810
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,000
be

811
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
established after

812
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,918
your l3dn

813
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,960
neighborship actually is established

814
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,560
or do you see them as they're not

815
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,359
compatible but

816
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,079
i have no objection to that anything

817
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,440
which is

818
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,918
which is not compatible in a data center

819
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,000
in my opinion is a big red alarm

820
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,839
because something broke in the

821
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,040
provisioning system

822
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,079
right

823
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,520
so if both sides aren't

824
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,399
compatible

825
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,079
for bfd

826
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,679
then

827
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,000
that's an error

828
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
character i think wanted to speak to the

829
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,119
point i can smell it

830
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,240
yeah that's a really good point uh

831
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,280
gunter i think

832
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,160
this

833
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,560
solution can benefit from

834
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,800
auto discovering and auto negotiating

835
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,320
bfd as well

836
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,160
alongside of bgp

837
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,599
and as you do that i think um

838
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,240
you can go here

839
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,640
yeah yeah exactly the fast fast session

840
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,359
deactivate

841
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,640
thank you you actually raised a point

842
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,839
uh

843
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,000
where

844
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,760
we always made

845
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,040
a claim

846
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,200
that said

847
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,240
that a good generic discovery protocol

848
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,480
mechanism is needed and here

849
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,920
it comes

850
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,640
that lung side of bgp you may need

851
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,280
something like pfd negotiation to be in

852
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,880
place also thank you that's all i had

853
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,000
could you drop that in an email gunter

854
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,680
yes no problem i'll send to the list

855
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,000
thank you

856
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,760
preferably on the mailing

857
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,640
yes yes

858
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,560
so any other questions or observations

859
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,040
thank you very much

860
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,440
thank you randy

861
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,520
let me go back to the first deck here

862
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,720
yeah i i just have one

863
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,760
uh

864
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,480
are we still going are we still gonna uh

865
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,520
progress

866
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,920
this protocol in this working group we

867
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,839
are aren't we

868
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,320
this is ac lindem again from cisco

869
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,720
systems

870
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,240
that's a question to the chairs i guess

871
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,800
yes yeah the l3

872
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,320
l3dl so so we were thinking of you know

873
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,440
so

874
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,079
so when we do the resharpening then the

875
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,400
idea would be to include l3dl and the

876
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,680
the layer 2 technology uh as part of the

877
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
shorter of the working group itself so

878
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,599
this uh this

879
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,400
cousin actually of

880
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,599
of l3dl uh it's relatively new i'm not

881
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,280
really sure yet you know if we if you

882
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,880
know if we act if we would like to work

883
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,599
upon two different sets here it is

884
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,000
something we can debate but i have the

885
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,760
impression that you know alvaro wants to

886
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,680
say something about that also because he

887
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,720
lined up very quickly

888
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,320
sorry paul i'm going to stand in front

889
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,280
of you

890
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,440
uh a little authentic

891
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,400
uh

892
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,920
yeah so that is the plan and that is

893
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,320
what we had agreed with the

894
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,520
idr chairs uh way back when all this

895
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,800
started

896
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,280
this was of course a few years ago

897
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,359
and it was before

898
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,720
um idr put so much emphasis on discovery

899
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,920
as well

900
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,839
uh we had of course consulted with them

901
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:02,800
because

902
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,880
um you know what we're doing here is

903
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,440
discovering the bgp peers right so we

904
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,000
felt that it would apply to other things

905
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,640
so yes that is the intent um

906
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,440
we probably need to do one more round of

907
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,680
um

908
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,839
syncing and consulting with uh idr just

909
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,200
to make sure we're all in the same in

910
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,119
the same

911
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,079
on the same page uh but you know barring

912
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,160
any any issues yes this working group

913
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,880
would then do l3dl

914
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,839
um as for

915
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,560
uh the layer three version we'll need to

916
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,560
uh have more conversations around that

917
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,160
thank you

918
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,680
um

919
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,440
i i had a just i mean this is my

920
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
ignorance on the layer three discovery

921
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,200
uh hello

922
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,920
uh multicast how how is that contained

923
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,240
within the network are there filters or

924
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,599
acls or something that keeps those

925
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,040
things from

926
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,480
flooding all over the place or do they

927
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,440
just flood all over the place

928
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,000
two things one it's point-to-point links

929
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,400
two it's gtsm

930
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,000
ttl cam

931
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,880
oh okay all right thanks

932
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,160
um

933
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,560
back to

934
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,440
alvaro's point

935
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,760
um um this this

936
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,119
layer three

937
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,680
discovery is just here informatively i

938
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,799
don't think we're

939
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,160
i mean if you want it if the chairs and

940
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,680
alvaro wanted in this group that's fine

941
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,240
it was really intended to be informative

942
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,839
here

943
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,160
yeah you and i are in sacramento thanks

944
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,119
right

945
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,880
and and there are some interesting

946
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,240
things

947
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,400
in it that

948
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,320
some of the pdus were a little further

949
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
developed than the last time you saw

950
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,920
l3dl

951
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,119
so

952
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,440
they'll merge and they'll go both their

953
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,040
own ways

954
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,280
and idr will decide would they want

955
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,680
layer two or layer three or both and god

956
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,800
knows

957
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,720
we're just trying to be friendly and

958
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,359
accommodating

959
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,680
ac lyndon cisco systems hey i was just

960
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,079
gonna comment on the scope of the pdus

961
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,160
uh

962
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,960
i have read these drafts but not before

963
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,040
this ietf i haven't read the latest

964
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,359
iteration of them so i don't remember

965
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,800
remember everything

966
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,560
but wouldn't i would think you would

967
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,079
just use the

968
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,440
all routers

969
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,319
uh multicast address which is link

970
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,520
scoped

971
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,240
in both ipv6 and ipv4 and then it would

972
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,079
never go beyond one link are you

973
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,440
thinking these are going to go beyond

974
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,280
one link these discovery packets

975
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,680
i mean beyond hop it's early in the

976
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,119
morning

977
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,839
i was thinking sue would speak to that

978
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,319
but if not oh she's left

979
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,240
um

980
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,118
it's allowed

981
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,160
but that's a configuration option

982
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,440
um

983
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,160
it's currently not envisioned to do so

984
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,319
certainly not one way or more than one

985
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,560
layer three

986
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,359
the question is whether layer two

987
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,480
care want to speak go for it yeah layer

988
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,240
two you get that for you get that for

989
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,400
free i mean with with

990
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,319
yeah

991
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,960
at layer two so

992
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,480
yeah that that is this is a scale

993
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,960
patella again our case that is how you

994
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,800
would probably want to do

995
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,880
um just as you have it to all routers

996
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,280
you see

997
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,040
my apologies for not i i haven't read

998
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,400
like i said i haven't read it in the

999
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,359
last

1000
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,598
month

1001
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,520
okay we have

1002
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,800
still in the queue or

1003
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,920
okay then i think we if there's like no

1004
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,280
further questions

1005
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,119
uh then i think we have reached the end

1006
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,240
of the session here so

1007
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,160
so we have used about like you know 40

1008
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,240
minutes from the two-hour slot

1009
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,160
so you got like uh like one hour and 20

1010
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,680
minutes back

1011
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,960
thank you all

1012
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,720
