so

7
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,720
sorry does the share preloaded slides

8
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,720
optional

9
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,959
okay let me try that again this one

10
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,720
okay

11
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,080
let everybody remote and in the room

12
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,799
hear me now

13
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,720
yay

14
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,959
okay

15
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,519
okay so welcome to the perigee pitting

16
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,639
at ietf 113.

17
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,680
this is a hybrid meeting you will have

18
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,759
noticed that unfortunately none of the

19
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
chairs were able to be there in person

20
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,639
so there is a sad little empty desk at

21
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,800
the front

22
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,919
um

23
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,240
i will remind everybody that this thing

24
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,160
is being recorded before we go any

25
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,280
further

26
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,240
and if i can uh if i can ask for a

27
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,880
volunteer for a minute taker if you're

28
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,680
interested in that please contact the

29
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,199
chairs by the chat

30
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,840
okay

31
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,720
as usual we have the

32
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,840
note 12

33
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,120
which we hope that everybody is familiar

34
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
with

35
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
and has read

36
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,120
and in particular we draw your attention

37
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,840
to the code of conduct the highlights on

38
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,039
this slide and we expect everybody to

39
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,159
adhere to that

40
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,400
moving on to the agenda

41
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,080
the blue sheets are generated

42
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,160
automatically by your attendance in meet

43
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,560
echo these days

44
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
uh shivan will be acting as javascribe

45
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,280
we'll be monitoring

46
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,680
the chat so if there's anything to put

47
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,479
in there you would like asked at the

48
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,520
mic

49
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,000
please prepend it with mike and he'll

50
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,520
bring that to

51
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,758
you

52
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,479
we have a notetaker thank you very much

53
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,759
and our agenda today is uh fairly light

54
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,360
we have one presentation on the

55
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,759
effectiveness of quick padding against

56
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,160
website fingerprinting

57
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,120
we have a presentation on gdpr and

58
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,960
network privacy

59
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,680
and then we have one update on the state

60
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
of the server worldwide censorship

61
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,080
technique draft by

62
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,479
mallory

63
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,960
before we get going i will just quickly

64
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,080
ask that

65
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,479
or remind people that participants in

66
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,880
the room will need to join queue via

67
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,639
meet echo

68
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
and then they can go up to mike to ask

69
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,600
the questions but when they do please do

70
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,240
state your name clearly as with masks it

71
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,039
makes it particularly hard to see who is

72
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,599
speaking

73
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,400
and the full participants can keep their

74
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,000
audio and video muted

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
uh when they're not speaking that will

76
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,639
be much appreciating i see that there is

77
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,880
an echo

78
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,759
i hope that's not me i will switch to a

79
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,280
headset

80
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,840
um

81
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,599
okay

82
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,000
some folks are hearing it and some

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,520
aren't so i don't know if it's

84
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,199
okay maybe the in-room like ah yeah

85
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
maybe mike is picking something up

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,199
uh hopefully that will get sorted out

87
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,520
um we will

88
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,759
start by

89
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
moving on to the first presentation

90
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
given by sandra

91
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,800
sidney

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,840
um

93
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
sandra would you like to

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,080
request to share your screen drive your

95
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,719
own slides

96
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,800
hey william

97
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,599
yes yeah

98
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,639
okay that's good i can see your slides

99
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,960
please go ahead uh let me just try to

100
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,039
move uh the slides okay that works

101
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,479
uh sorry for the echo

102
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,560
okay uh hello everyone uh today i'm

103
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,360
going to talk about uh work on

104
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
developing defenses

105
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,479
against

106
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,800
website fingerprinting of

107
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,639
quick traffic

108
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,280
this is a joint work with ludovic

109
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,720
christopher marwan nick and carmela and

110
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,360
we are from epfl and cloudflare

111
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
so before i go into the details of our

112
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,640
work i just want to give a quick

113
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,399
overview on website fingerprinting

114
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,519
so

115
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,399
let's say that we have a client and this

116
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,600
client is trying to visit a webpage in

117
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,040
this case example.com

118
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,200
we have an adversary that's on the path

119
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
between the client and the destination

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,279
host

121
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,399
and the adversary is

122
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,640
observing the traffic between the two

123
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
parties

124
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,080
now since the channel is encrypted uh

125
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
the client sorry the adversary does not

126
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,880
know uh which web page is being visited

127
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,160
by the client

128
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,800
uh all the adversary can see is some

129
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,600
metadata of the traffic and in this

130
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,800
scenario the ip addresses uh we assume

131
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,440
that there are measures such as ech or

132
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
encrypted dns

133
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
so that the adversary does not see the

134
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,120
domain uh that the client is visiting

135
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
so the goal of the adversary in website

136
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,240
fingerprinting is to determine uh

137
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
which webpage is being visited from just

138
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,079
observing this metadata

139
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
in order to do this

140
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,519
the adversary has a pre-trained machine

141
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,160
learning classifier that's already been

142
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
trained on some

143
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
network traffic traces that they've

144
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
collected

145
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,079
so what happens here is that the

146
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,120
adversary gets the traffic sample and

147
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,760
then creates some features

148
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,440
so on the

149
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,360
left side of the slide i have some of

150
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
the characteristics that the adversary

151
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,399
uses in order to develop these features

152
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,160
and these features are then fed into the

153
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,519
classifier

154
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,920
and the classifier spits out a

155
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,279
prediction uh on what webpage this could

156
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,760
be and this is how the attack works

157
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,920
so in our scenario we are interested in

158
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
seeing uh

159
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,160
how website fingerprinting works over a

160
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,320
quick connection between the client and

161
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,120
the destination

162
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,839
now uh website fingerprinting on quick

163
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,560
traffic is not new uh it's actually

164
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
already been done and this work was

165
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
actually

166
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,120
presented at

167
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,519
the ietf last year

168
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,720
and

169
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,480
they concluded that it is no harder to

170
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
fingerprint quick traffic as compared to

171
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,399
tcp and

172
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,120
the adversary can identify pages over a

173
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,640
quick connection with high accuracy

174
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,760
what we are interested in looking at

175
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,320
is whether it is possible to develop

176
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
defenses against being fingerprinted by

177
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,640
such an adversary

178
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
so if you look at the quick rfc

179
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,560
there is this option for a quick padding

180
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,040
frame that allows you to increase the

181
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,920
size of quick packets and the rc

182
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
specifies that this padding could

183
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
potentially be used to provide

184
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
protection against traffic analysis

185
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,279
and this is what we are interested in

186
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,240
exploring further

187
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,800
so i want to talk a little bit now about

188
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,120
the adversarial model that we are

189
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,399
considering

190
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,680
uh so

191
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,240
we have a bunch of vantage points which

192
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,399
can be routers or switches or middle

193
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
boxes on the internet and they are

194
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,920
located in

195
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
different ass

196
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,279
so let's say that we have a client in

197
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,279
asx in this scenario and the client is

198
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
interested in visiting

199
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,760
uh some webpages which are

200
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,639
hosted on destination hosts uh in

201
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,000
another as

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
uh this is for simplification that

203
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,519
they're all in the same as but they

204
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,519
could be located in different

205
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,880
destination holes in different asses

206
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,440
now these web pages can host

207
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,760
sub-resources which are also located in

208
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,399
many different endpoints

209
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
so when the client tries to visit and

210
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
obtain these resources the network

211
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,440
traffic passes through a bunch of

212
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,519
different vantage points

213
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,200
uh as seen by the red arrows here

214
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,240
so in our scenario the adversary is an

215
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,279
as that is interested in finding out

216
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,200
which webpage is being visited by the

217
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,279
client

218
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,560
now these

219
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
vantage points

220
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,720
will collect different subsets of the

221
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,360
traffic and as we saw here we have a

222
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,560
machine learning classifier which uh

223
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,959
which requires collection as well as

224
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,600
storage and computation on these traffic

225
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
traces

226
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,519
so

227
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,200
because of this we actually have a

228
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,720
centralized location in each as and all

229
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,440
the

230
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,639
vantage points uh transmit the traffic

231
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,519
that they collect to this location which

232
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,839
actually performs the website

233
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,240
fingerprinting attack as seen by the

234
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,120
purple arrows

235
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,920
so

236
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,000
what we want to do now

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,079
is the goal of the adversary here is to

238
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,440
identify the correct web pages uh web

239
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,920
page among all the web pages that are

240
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,920
hosted on a single ip so since the ips

241
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
are seen by the adversary they can

242
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
already filter traffic based on ip

243
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,279
address so they just need to identify

244
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,120
which web page is

245
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
being visited among all the web pages

246
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
that are posted on one ip address in our

247
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,800
scenario

248
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,360
so we do our experiments with a quick

249
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,880
dominant uh data set uh of 150 pages

250
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,079
here so we did this by crawling the web

251
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,720
pages in popular uh

252
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,279
lists such as the alexa one million this

253
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
is similar to prior work that's been

254
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,800
done on free traffic

255
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,320
and we looked at uh which web pages have

256
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,120
a high proportion of quick traffic uh

257
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,760
since uh quick is still being adopted a

258
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,920
lot of web pages are still

259
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,079
transmitting their resources over

260
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,480
non-quick connections but since we are

261
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,560
analyzing quick we wanted to build

262
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,199
something which has primarily uh quick

263
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,000
traffic and we found that

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
for our

265
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,279
data set we had approximately 70 percent

266
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,279
quick traffic on average

267
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,360
uh just want to note that previously we

268
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,199
tried to be more realistic and we

269
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,000
partnered with cloudflare uh to look at

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
uh domains that are hosted on a single

271
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,279
ip

272
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,800
uh and

273
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,680
get the traffic traffic for those but

274
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,079
those had only about four percent uh

275
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,480
peak on average so we went with this

276
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,000
method to build our data set

277
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
um as i mentioned this is the process

278
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,480
that we have for the

279
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
for the website fingerprinting but now

280
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,440
we see here in the second step

281
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,199
we apply a

282
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,839
defense to the traffic sample which i'll

283
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,800
come to uh in the upcoming slides and

284
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,360
then we pass this defended sample into

285
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,120
the classifier

286
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
and we see how well the classifier

287
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,360
performs against these defended traces

288
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,880
um i'll be using a couple of uh

289
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,399
well-known classifiers from the

290
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,639
literature which is there in the yellow

291
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,880
box below if you have any questions you

292
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,480
can ask me about that later

293
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,360
so the metric that we are using to

294
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,079
evaluate is a common metric used in

295
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,920
these kind of works which is called f

296
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,199
score

297
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,560
now f score is the harmonic mean of the

298
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,399
recall and the precision of the

299
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,600
classifier

300
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,759
so recall means how many relevant

301
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,639
results are returned by a classifier and

302
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,560
precision indicates how many of those

303
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,639
are actually correct

304
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,399
so we have 150 pages in the data set

305
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,560
which means that if we were to have an

306
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,959
adversary randomly guess which web page

307
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,920
it was we would have a 0.67 percent

308
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,160
chance of getting this right

309
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,240
but we see actually that uh for our uh

310
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,199
classifier we get a 96 percent f score

311
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,360
which means that on undefended uh

312
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,240
traffic the adversary has a very good uh

313
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,399
chance of identifying the webpage that

314
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,839
is being visited by the client

315
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,919
so when we look at what features are

316
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,400
important for the classifier

317
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,880
we see actually that the size based

318
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,599
features are very important so

319
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,959
how many

320
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,280
packets of particular sizes as well as

321
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
the total number of bytes that are

322
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,240
incoming and outgoing are

323
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
mainly used by the classifier to

324
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,160
identify the page

325
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,280
so

326
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,919
the first thing that we do is we try to

327
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,799
apply some defenses to hide these

328
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,600
features from the classifier

329
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
so the first thing that we do is we pad

330
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,480
individual packets and hide the packet

331
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,039
based uh features as shown in the figure

332
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,240
here

333
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
and we see that that

334
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,720
does not uh really decrease the f score

335
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
by a lot it goes down by about two

336
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
percent

337
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,070
um

338
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,320
[Music]

339
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,880
the next thing that we do is we hide the

340
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
total amount of traffic in both

341
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,080
directions

342
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,320
by applying some amount of padding to

343
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,880
each of the packets and we still see

344
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,240
that

345
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,799
the f score is really high which is

346
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,280
about 92 percent

347
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,600
and now we look again at the features of

348
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,440
the classifier to see

349
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,760
why it is doing so well when five space

350
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,240
features are no longer used

351
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,080
and we see that there is a lot of

352
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,720
directionality based features that are

353
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
still leveraged by the classifier so

354
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
hiding the total size and individual

355
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
size does not hide how many packets are

356
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
going in each direction

357
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,880
and

358
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
this is now being used instead of the

359
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,919
size based features

360
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,559
so in order to hide the

361
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,200
directionality-based features uh we now

362
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,840
perform this defense where we inject

363
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,559
dummies randomly into the trace

364
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,760
and what we actually see is that

365
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,320
injecting dummies does decrease

366
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,960
the performance of the classifier but

367
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,840
it also comes with a high cost so we see

368
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,720
that

369
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,600
it goes down to

370
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,960
about

371
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,000
uh six it goes down by about 16 percent

372
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
in the worst case but with a hundred

373
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,400
percent overhead when you add these

374
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,120
dummies and this is not including

375
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,480
the uh additional traffic just is

376
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
injected in order to hide the packet

377
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,200
based features

378
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
so what we come to

379
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,799
what we conclude is that

380
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,360
these network defenses

381
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,200
offer low protection

382
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,760
with high costs for example just to get

383
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,799
a 10 reduction in f score we need more

384
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,760
than 50 percent overhead when it comes

385
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,799
to dummy injections

386
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,480
now so far i've talked about an

387
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,280
unconstrained adversary and this

388
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,880
adversary observes all the traffic and

389
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,240
also performs uh this classification

390
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,400
with all the traffic that it sees

391
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,120
but in reality it is possible that you

392
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,440
don't have a perfect adversary and

393
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,679
adversaries can be constrained not just

394
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,919
in the amount of traffic they see but

395
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,039
also in what they do with this traffic

396
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,960
so the first thing we look at is an

397
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,360
adversary that has a limited view of the

398
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,080
traffic so for example you have a

399
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,799
vantage point of as5 you might miss a

400
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,320
lot of the other red arrows

401
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,120
and the other traffic that the client is

402
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,320
uh

403
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,159
generating

404
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,720
so in order to see what this is actually

405
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,039
observed how much of the traffic we

406
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,200
generated uh trace curves from the

407
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,919
client for all the pages in our data set

408
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,520
and observed uh how the stray shots pain

409
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
so this is the result from one of the

410
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
vantage points that we conducted the

411
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
experiment from uh we did this on

412
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,919
multiple vantage points and we observed

413
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,280
similar trends

414
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,520
uh and what we see is that there are

415
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,640
only a few large asls that can observe a

416
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,799
large proportion of the traffic in the

417
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,000
first place so that means that uh

418
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,159
here in this scenario

419
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,240
on the left plot we see that there are

420
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,559
only three yes that can even observe

421
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,159
more than 50

422
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,640
of the pages in a data set and on the

423
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
right clock you see that

424
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,520
for those

425
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,799
pages

426
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,880
about three of them can observe more

427
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,320
than 50

428
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,280
of all the routes for each page

429
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,039
so this means that

430
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,080
a lot of the adversaries by

431
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,640
virtue of their location

432
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,960
might not even be able to successfully

433
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,840
conduct an

434
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,520
attack another interesting thing that we

435
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
saw was that

436
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,559
google actually has a large relevance on

437
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,520
the pages so more than 80

438
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,400
of the pages on our data set contain at

439
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,280
least one resource that is hosted by

440
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,799
google

441
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,400
and uh

442
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,799
found that actually these resources

443
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,720
could be um

444
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,400
ordered differently and different web

445
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,720
pages which means that timing to google

446
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,840
resources is a low cost fingerprint and

447
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,159
can uh have up to 77.9 percent f score

448
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,320
this means an adversary for example like

449
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,000
an isp i can just use times to google

450
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
instead of

451
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,000
using all the traffic that we observe

452
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,159
and identify

453
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,200
with high accuracy

454
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,240
the next thing that we noted was how

455
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,320
well these advertisers perform with

456
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,480
limited uh processing

457
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,280
so previously uh i said that random

458
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,200
phones are transmitting all the traffic

459
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,120
that would observe to this centralized

460
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,320
location

461
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,720
uh now what we wanted to see if instead

462
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,880
of transferring all the traffic whether

463
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,440
these vantage points can just transmit

464
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,159
uh flow summaries of this traffic

465
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,880
to these centralized locations

466
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,039
so in order to simulate this we use

467
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,919
something called sampled net flow uh so

468
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,480
what happens here is that the packet

469
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,919
races are sampled and then uh

470
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,919
flow submarines are created and these

471
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,960
are sent to the centralized location and

472
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
we perform the attacks

473
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,000
this

474
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,679
with the submarines instead of the

475
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,120
packet traces

476
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,480
and we experimented with various uh

477
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,919
sampling rates

478
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,440
what happens to the adversary's

479
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,880
performance

480
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,720
so as expected uh we see that with lower

481
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,240
sampling rings

482
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,640
you also have much lower performance of

483
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,000
the anniversary

484
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,919
because there is much less traffic for

485
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,880
the adversary to make good features from

486
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,919
uh just want to note that even at a 0.1

487
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,720
sampling rate it is still much higher

488
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,320
than the random baseline

489
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,720
then when we applied the padding

490
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,200
lenses uh we do see that there is some

491
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,679
reduction

492
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,600
in the

493
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,000
performance of the adversary however we

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
want to point out that in the case of

495
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,720
the limited adversary a lot of the gains

496
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,520
come from the sampling process here more

497
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,559
than the actual application of the

498
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,360
defense

499
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,279
so what we actually find is that

500
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,480
is that

501
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,559
the network layer defenses in the case

502
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,400
of both unconstrained and constrained

503
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,159
adversaries do not

504
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,200
efficiently uh hide a lot of the global

505
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,960
features and

506
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,400
the main reason uh for this is that

507
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,679
they do not know the sizes of traces in

508
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,240
advance to efficiently design

509
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,559
uh padding strategy so there is no

510
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,520
application layer information uh that is

511
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,559
given here and so you need to randomly

512
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,320
inject dummies um or add size based feed

513
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,559
size based defenses

514
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
and this could increase the overhead of

515
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,640
these network layer defenses

516
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,600
so then we wanted to see whether

517
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,240
applying defenses the application layer

518
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,960
could potentially help

519
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,320
protect against these attacks

520
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
so in order to do this we started

521
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,960
analyzing the structure of the pages uh

522
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,760
so here's a quick uh refresher on

523
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,480
terminology that i'm going to use uh so

524
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,200
let's say that we are visiting

525
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,760
example.com uh you might have resources

526
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,520
from uh uh

527
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,320
exam from the same domain example.com

528
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,640
and these are called uh first party

529
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,039
resources or you might have resources

530
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,799
from other domains so here you have

531
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,039
tracker.com and these are called

532
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,919
third-party resources

533
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,840
and when we look at the web page

534
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,159
structure what we see is that

535
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,520
in our data set uh 18 of the web pages

536
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,799
actually have

537
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,720
a very small number of first party

538
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,679
resources so you actually have a large

539
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,120
prevalence of third parties and there is

540
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,799
in a large prevalence of google

541
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,600
resources in our data sets so 24 of the

542
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,080
pages actually even have more than 50

543
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,559
percent of google resources

544
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,559
so what does that mean when it comes to

545
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,559
applying a defense

546
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,400
it means that third parties are

547
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,720
contributing a large proportion of

548
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,840
resources to the webpage and

549
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,039
in order to apply a defense we actually

550
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,200
would need cooperation from all the

551
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,440
parties that are supplying some resource

552
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,000
to the web page and we actually did do

553
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,480
experiments on this where we hid the

554
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,200
resources from third parties or

555
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,880
from first parties to simulate the

556
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,520
scenario of only one of these parties

557
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,360
participating in the resources

558
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,200
and then we went for the application

559
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,440
defenses so we applied the same uh

560
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,640
packet and

561
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
space padding uh to

562
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,520
uh but at the application layer so we

563
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,159
are protecting the actual resources here

564
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,880
and we still see that uh the packing is

565
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,120
ineffective here once again because of

566
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,520
the because the adversary just uses the

567
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,760
ordering based resources

568
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,880
however when we apply uh dummies now

569
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,720
into the uh uh into the uh

570
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,600
resources we actually see that uh this

571
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,440
can be more effective than in the

572
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,399
network layer case and for example

573
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,039
injecting five dummies on average reduce

574
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,240
the f score by 39 with a relatively low

575
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,279
cost

576
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,120
but in reality if you wanted to

577
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,880
implement something like this that

578
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,640
actually comes with some deployment

579
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,200
complexity because injecting dummies

580
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,159
here means that you're actually sending

581
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,799
some requests for some dummy resources

582
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,720
and we'll have to think about how those

583
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,399
would be implemented

584
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,679
uh

585
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,919
and how that would uh impact the

586
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,039
client's experience

587
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,799
so in short

588
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,200
what we found is that at least for the

589
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,600
network level if we want to

590
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,480
implement an efficient resource we need

591
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,399
some sort of information from the

592
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,080
application layer

593
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,159
otherwise this could lead to large

594
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,440
overheads

595
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,960
at the same time if we decide to

596
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,799
implement things on the application

597
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,919
layer

598
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,080
they come with a whole set of other

599
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,880
complexities so they would require some

600
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,600
sort of coordination between parties or

601
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,000
we would have to talk to developers on

602
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,120
how to

603
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,559
uh how to write code so that resources

604
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,640
are always

605
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
fetched in some sort of a standardized

606
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,760
manner and finally all of these changes

607
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,200
in the application layer could

608
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,000
potentially have a large impact on

609
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,919
client experience

610
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,279
at the moment we are working to see uh

611
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,600
further what kind of

612
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,679
practices would have to be

613
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,320
done in order to develop better

614
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,640
application layer defenses

615
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,840
and here's a link to our paper and feel

616
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,919
free to ask me some questions

617
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,159
thank you

618
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,960
um i see some people in the queue

619
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,039
uh sharon

620
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,240
yes i how are you sandra thank you i

621
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,679
have a i have a question for you

622
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,960
if you

623
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,600
think of the definitions uh slightly

624
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
different

625
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,080
where

626
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,279
the adversary is actually the client

627
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,080
sending traffic because his malware

628
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,880
and he's doing some data leak

629
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
or lateral movement

630
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
and the one sampling

631
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,799
is the protection software

632
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,399
really has a very high score by sampling

633
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,679
netflow

634
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,640
and

635
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,480
detect the raw the rogue client

636
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,480
so according to your analysis

637
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,559
the only way

638
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,640
the malware can throw off the detection

639
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,240
sampler

640
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,200
is by injecting a lot of dummy traffic

641
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,520
into whatever it does to avoid the

642
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,120
pattern recognition is that correct

643
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,240
uh

644
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,880
so you're assuming here that the client

645
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,039
is the adversary right

646
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,799
yeah he's malware

647
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,000
and i want to detect him by sampling

648
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,720
and you're saying if i use quick

649
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,679
it's not going to reduce my f score

650
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,600
but if he's going to

651
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,840
use a lot of dummy traffic

652
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,520
in his malware

653
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,799
then

654
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,600
then yes but at a high cost

655
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
something like that

656
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,640
yeah so

657
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,880
so in this scenario uh what you're

658
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,320
saying is that actually uh

659
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,840
analyzing the network traffic would be a

660
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,600
good thing because you want to detect

661
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,799
the malware yes yes uh i mean what i'm

662
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,960
saying right now is that

663
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,039
generally most of the defenses that we

664
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,440
have or rather in this scenario anything

665
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,399
to prevent this detection are not going

666
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,480
to help much so

667
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,279
you would be able to detect this with a

668
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,960
large

669
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,880
accuracy already

670
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,919
and if if the client wanted to perform

671
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,679
against that they would have to think of

672
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,480
some good way of injecting dummies as

673
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,080
you say

674
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,919
great great thank you very much we'll

675
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,480
look forward to seeing some raw data if

676
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
it's possible to share

677
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
yeah we'll be sharing that

678
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,840
thank you very much thanks

679
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,158
um did you want to go next

680
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,399
yeah thank you for this presentation

681
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,200
it's

682
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,320
very useful for us to think about this

683
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,399
type of threat and it's

684
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,760
useful to get some data um i'm curious

685
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,840
about clarifying the threat a little bit

686
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,960
more

687
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,480
precisely

688
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,000
i've just skimmed the paper but my

689
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,519
understanding is that

690
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,799
you

691
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,279
uh removed all caches and just made a

692
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,240
single

693
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,640
uh web page load to the index page of

694
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,480
each

695
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,799
popular domain name and the goal was

696
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,640
just can you distinguish

697
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,039
loading the index page with no caching

698
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:33,840
of

699
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,399
one domain versus another in cases where

700
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,320
for example they're hosted by the same

701
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,640
cdn or something like that

702
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,399
yes that's right

703
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,799
and and so i'm just curious like how is

704
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,240
this

705
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,679
how is this type of attack going to

706
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,320
apply to cases where maybe i don't go to

707
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,399
the index page

708
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,039
or maybe i load a customized resource or

709
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,200
maybe i have cached resources or

710
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,240
various other situations like that

711
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,679
because it seems like many of the times

712
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,360
that we're worried about the network

713
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,960
adversary we're worried about them

714
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,000
learning

715
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,120
what i'm reading or um

716
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,279
or the contents of my messages or

717
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,799
lots of different threats and that's not

718
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,640
to downplay the threat of them knowing

719
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,600
that i'm

720
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
even going to a particular domain name

721
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,760
but does this threat also apply to

722
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,240
learning what pages i'm visiting or

723
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,159
or cases where the network traffic is

724
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,159
going to be mixed or resources will be

725
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,399
cached et cetera

726
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,120
uh yeah that's a good question and this

727
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,039
is also a field of research in this area

728
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:39,919
so

729
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,840
like you said we are working with

730
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,919
relatively clean traces here where we

731
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,200
are assuming

732
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,399
uh no caching and like no background

733
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,519
traffic and it's just the home pages

734
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,519
but we are planning now for example to

735
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,440
do some experiments where we are also

736
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,000
visiting subpages of different websites

737
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,720
to see how well this attack is going to

738
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,000
work

739
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,519
and there is also i think work done by

740
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,079
others now there are some papers coming

741
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,359
up where

742
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,000
they're looking at fingerprinting in the

743
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,839
presence of all these

744
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,879
factors that add some noise but yeah i i

745
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,159
would say that

746
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,079
this is kind of the worst case for the

747
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,639
uh worst case i mean the best case for

748
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,280
the adversary and all of these factors

749
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,399
would uh

750
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,480
possibly lead to a reduction in the f

751
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,879
score

752
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,520
that's that right we don't know how much

753
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,079
of a reduction but yes it will be worth

754
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,679
further research

755
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,159
uh yeah we'll probably get some numbers

756
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,000
when we run this possibly next month

757
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,520
okay great well i think many of us will

758
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
be interested in those numbers too thank

759
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,359
you thanks

760
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,399
okay

761
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,000
sandra thank you very much for that

762
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,800
presentation and for all the questions

763
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,480
there is some interesting discussion in

764
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,280
the chat and i'm sure sandra will

765
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,800
follow up there on that as well

766
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,440
thanks sarah yeah thank you

767
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,079
okay so our next presentation i believe

768
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,520
is one by

769
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,200
somebody in the room a real person there

770
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,720
we go step forward thank you

771
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,920
do you want to attempt to share your

772
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,240
screen

773
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,560
okay

774
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
sandra you may

775
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,200
need to stop sharing your screen please

776
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,280
okay great

777
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,060
and

778
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,170
[Music]

779
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,920
okay here come the slides i think

780
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,079
okay i think they've loaded

781
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,480
okay go ahead then please

782
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
so i'm luigi i'm gonna present a little

783
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,400
bit um

784
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,680
the relation between gdpr okay luigi i

785
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
i'm having trouble hearing you i don't

786
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,920
know if everybody else is as well

787
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,560
maybe you're okay in the room but

788
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,280
it's quite quiet remotely

789
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,000
better better thank you okay

790
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,320
just to hit the mic with the mask

791
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,400
okay i'm going to talk a little bit

792
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,800
about gdpr and relation with the ip

793
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,400
addresses in general a little bit um as

794
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,119
the title say that how layer eight meets

795
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,480
layer three

796
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,119
okay uh knowing i'm not a lawyer just to

797
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,400
be clear

798
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
so this is my interpretation i spent

799
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,000
some time reading

800
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,440
and uh so i'll give you some some some

801
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,320
interesting point that we may discuss

802
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,680
later on so i'll

803
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,359
really one slide history some

804
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,920
terminology and then we dig a little bit

805
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,160
in gdpr and ip addresses

806
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,839
there is a

807
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,720
a few slides that make a clear link

808
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,800
between existing rfcs

809
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,400
and gdpr

810
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,880
if time we will go over that as well

811
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,640
okay

812
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,839
so

813
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,800
um gdpr came into effect in 2018 so it's

814
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,240
not that long ago replaced a very old uh

815
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,359
data protection act in europe it is a

816
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,920
regulation which means it is slightly

817
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,160
more complex than a simple law because

818
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,280
there are

819
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,320
articles which are the law itself but

820
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,440
there are also recitals

821
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,839
which are notes that explain actually

822
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,480
how to apply the laws okay

823
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,000
which is the body of gdpr

824
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,760
luigi i think it's still pretty quiet if

825
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,000
you wouldn't mind just um just speaking

826
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,599
up i guess a little bit

827
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,440
speaking even more up

828
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,800
okay

829
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,359
as much as i can okay thank you the key

830
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,760
point is personal data okay what is

831
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,920
personal data is anything that can

832
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,119
identify a natural person not a legal

833
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,119
person like a company is different a

834
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,359
natural person like me all of you in the

835
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,520
room and connected elsewhere

836
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,760
name personal addresses anything that

837
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,880
can can identify ourselves

838
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,079
information

839
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,880
concerning our employment

840
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,640
financial information you have the

841
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,040
details in this slide which is pretty

842
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,920
worthy there are also sensitive

843
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,960
information which is like

844
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,760
ethnic origins or really religious

845
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,720
belief or anything it's real personal

846
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,880
choices in a certain way

847
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,040
and any other information that actually

848
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,880
you you are willing to disclose by

849
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,680
yourself for example to your employer

850
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,079
okay in this last bullet

851
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,160
i put my employer but it's just any

852
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,520
employer can

853
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,160
or any entity can ask you for some

854
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,240
information that you may wish to discuss

855
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,000
but is really personal

856
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,119
this is about the personal data then we

857
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,640
have three

858
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,320
key points which are the console

859
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,880
processor and processing so the console

860
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,320
is who is controlling the personal data

861
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,640
okay because if you give the data to

862
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,599
someone

863
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,040
that someone is controlling your

864
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,440
personal data okay

865
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,119
and he may wish

866
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,359
to do some processing which is the

867
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,119
action of

868
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,280
taking your data and

869
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,520
making something to get some stats for

870
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,119
example right this is the processing

871
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:25,920
and

872
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,400
the the the entity

873
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,480
that does the processing is the

874
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,000
processors

875
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,920
okay which is actually doing the

876
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,960
processing now it's kind of a headache

877
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,680
but these three things are correlated

878
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,160
and do overlap

879
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,040
okay

880
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,560
it's like

881
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,480
i connected to my isp i sign a contract

882
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,680
i give some personal information the isp

883
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,920
controls my personal data

884
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,680
that i gave to him

885
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,800
okay

886
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,760
and

887
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,560
he may decide to do some stats okay and

888
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,040
he decides how to process

889
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,480
the data

890
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,960
but not necessarily does it itself he

891
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,319
can ask somebody else a third party to

892
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,200
do it which will be the processor

893
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,439
okay

894
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,160
now

895
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,880
gdpr and ip addresses so in the gdpr

896
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,319
is clearly stated that any online

897
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,680
identifier is personal data okay

898
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,640
especially this applies to ip addresses

899
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,920
and the european court of justice

900
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,839
ruled that it is

901
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,280
personal identification data because you

902
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,160
can

903
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,560
associate and retrieve

904
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,440
a lot of other information even if you

905
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,800
use temporary addresses okay

906
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,760
so as such it falls specifically under

907
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,160
gdpr and privacy protection

908
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,560
now um i will go a little bit through

909
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,560
the the seven principles of gdpr and try

910
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,480
to make a link

911
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,240
to what is

912
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,920
an example of how does does it apply on

913
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,400
the on the protocol stack let's say more

914
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,040
specifically to the network layer okay

915
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,319
and ip addresses

916
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,839
uh the first very simple principle is

917
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,000
lawfulness fairness and transparency

918
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,319
which basically says that if i give my

919
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,560
personal data to my isp

920
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,280
i expect that

921
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,240
it does use my personal data

922
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,440
according to the law gdpr is part of it

923
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,720
okay

924
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,760
um

925
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,960
you know

926
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,839
in an undiscriminated

927
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:56,000
discriminatory manner okay and in a

928
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,480
transparent manner which includes my

929
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,040
explicit consent i will

930
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,839
come back to this a little bit later

931
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,680
uh second principle is

932
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,280
purpose limitation is the fact that uh

933
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,480
uh

934
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,319
my isp

935
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,560
is not allowed to use my personal data

936
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,280
for whatever he wants okay

937
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,680
he is able to to use my ip address in

938
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,839
order to count my packets for billing

939
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,040
purposes

940
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,599
is not allowed to

941
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,599
look what is in my packets in order to

942
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,040
measure how much shopping i do online

943
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,480
because this

944
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,520
is not related to the service that it

945
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,480
proposes the isp is proposing internet

946
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,079
connectivity

947
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,079
okay

948
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,200
third principle data is minimization is

949
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,560
the fact that

950
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,720
uh mysp is allowed to collect as much

951
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,480
data that is needed to offer the service

952
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,440
but not more for of that okay

953
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,280
so he can certainly again access to the

954
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,119
ip header

955
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,119
the transport header to provide the

956
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,400
service but not access the content of my

957
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,200
packet in order to look at what i

958
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,000
actually do exactly even if it isn't

959
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,599
clear

960
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,520
okay

961
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,319
accuracy for the principle is the fact

962
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,000
that

963
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,280
anything

964
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,119
the isp gathers

965
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,599
of me must be accurate okay that

966
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,640
or error free if you wish okay

967
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,599
uh storage limitation is the fact that

968
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,760
uh

969
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,280
my my data cannot be archived forever

970
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,599
okay

971
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,960
there is typically a limited amount of

972
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,000
time

973
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,119
that

974
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,200
my data can be collected then it should

975
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,480
be deleted

976
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,560
if i do not ask actually to do it

977
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,800
beforehand because there is this also

978
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,760
this aspect that actually i i

979
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,079
have the right to be forgotten so that i

980
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,800
can ask to delete all my data okay

981
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,079
this is interesting is kind of

982
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,119
tussling somehow because

983
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,599
on the on the one side we have gdpr that

984
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,560
asks

985
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,480
storage limitation on the other side

986
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,319
load enforcement

987
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,160
and for some minimal

988
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,480
time to to keep some logs

989
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,720
for accountability and traceability of

990
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,280
some stuff so there is

991
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,359
a balance to strike there at some point

992
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,000
okay um security integrity and

993
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,560
confidentiality is just that

994
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,400
if i give my personal data to the isp

995
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,800
i assume that isp is doing his best to

996
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,760
protect my personal data and they gonna

997
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,240
not do not go out in the wild

998
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
okay

999
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,400
which brings to the fact that is he is

1000
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,640
actually accountable

1001
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,079
for my personal data and even

1002
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,040
in the case as i explained before that

1003
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,240
my isp is the console of my data and it

1004
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,800
gives my data to someone else in order

1005
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,440
to process them okay to perform a

1006
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,040
processing

1007
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,760
and in something goes wrong and the

1008
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,119
processor actually leaks my data

1009
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,920
the one that is accountable from my

1010
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,560
perspective is the isp

1011
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,560
okay

1012
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,880
it's not moving anymore

1013
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,720
i don't know

1014
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,160
what okay

1015
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,520
so this is really

1016
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,440
high level uh what happens in gdpr and

1017
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,040
how we can relate with with

1018
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,480
the ip protocol stack so

1019
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,200
you know that gdpr is peculiar for the

1020
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,000
european union is not the only example

1021
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,040
okay in this table there is a summary of

1022
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,680
other laws regulation you can

1023
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,720
find all over the world okay there are

1024
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,079
there are more or less or similar

1025
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,560
and they all more or less consider ip

1026
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,599
addresses

1027
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,400
as a personal data

1028
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,040
there are some legal nuances in a

1029
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,920
certain way so for example in brazil he

1030
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,520
is not explicitly stated that uh

1031
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,839
ip addresses or online

1032
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,480
identifiers uh

1033
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,040
are included in in the law but the way

1034
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,200
the law is expressed

1035
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,839
ip addresses falling okay

1036
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,640
another interesting uh peculiarity is

1037
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,599
the fact that in japan even anonymized

1038
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,760
data

1039
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,720
covered by the appi which is the the

1040
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,079
japanese

1041
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,319
equivalent of gdpr

1042
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,440
which is not the case in here for gdpr

1043
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,319
in europe once you anonymize the data

1044
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,160
and you are sure that there

1045
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,640
is no way to go back and find the the

1046
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,440
the

1047
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,160
original information

1048
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,079
gdpr is out of the scope okay

1049
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,960
and all of the laws are based on

1050
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,599
on consent

1051
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,720
usually explicit consent which means

1052
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,680
that

1053
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,880
you have

1054
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,480
to take an expletive explicit action

1055
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,040
to give your concept which means when

1056
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,960
you are in europe you have this pop-up

1057
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,880
window that say you accept the cookies

1058
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,440
and you have to to to click yes or no

1059
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
and today we have also different

1060
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,720
settings

1061
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,319
this is a

1062
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,079
explicit action okay you cannot just put

1063
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,880
some place in the webpage oh by the way

1064
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,680
we are collecting cookies

1065
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,079
if you have something against

1066
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,240
please shut up

1067
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,280
speak up

1068
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,079
okay

1069
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,800
so you cannot do that because would be a

1070
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,559
passive consent

1071
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,960
okay

1072
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,839
and in canada

1073
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:19,240
on the contrary this is uh allowed okay

1074
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,880
i would like just to make one one single

1075
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,680
point uh you can go over the slide there

1076
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,000
are the rfc numbers

1077
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,200
um which try to to make a clear link

1078
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,440
between gdpr and and

1079
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,119
and what we do here in uh

1080
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,000
and the atf the only thing is this slide

1081
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,359
in uh rfc

1082
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:54,400
6973 there are already some wording that

1083
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,599
clearly points to the same principles

1084
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,839
that we can find in gdpr

1085
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:00,880
so

1086
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,640
just to state is not out in the moon

1087
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,200
gdpr is something that in a certain way

1088
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,280
we already uh share as a principle okay

1089
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,240
and i think i'm done so that we are

1090
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,720
in time

1091
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,640
perfect thank you so much and thank you

1092
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
for giving this talk on a topic which

1093
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,000
comes up repeatedly inside the ietf

1094
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,960
um i see we have patrick in the queue

1095
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,880
please go ahead patrick

1096
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,119
hello uh patrick tarpie i've come very

1097
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,680
interesting presentation

1098
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,160
just an observation really

1099
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,920
it's a kind of known fact that in the

1100
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,160
european union area

1101
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,000
there's a piece of regulation called the

1102
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,960
data retention directive which requires

1103
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,720
communication providers

1104
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,319
to keep

1105
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,720
call data records for the purposes of

1106
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,920
lawful intercept and all that malarkey

1107
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,599
to what extent

1108
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,119
do you think

1109
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,160
that new protocols such as mask over

1110
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,160
quick

1111
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,280
and oblivious technology to some extent

1112
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,720
render this conversation about the

1113
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,440
privacy of ip addresses or indeed

1114
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,800
you know the actors that you've

1115
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,200
mentioned in your presentation

1116
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,200
kind of obsolete really do you think

1117
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,280
that's a fair comment you know that if

1118
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,200
the evolution of mask

1119
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,119
proxies and oblivious kind of make this

1120
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,400
idea a bit

1121
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,079
exponential and a challenge

1122
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,280
thank you for the question

1123
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,359
it's very very interesting question uh

1124
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,880
uh top of my head the answer is uh i

1125
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
think this that technology are very

1126
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,160
useful

1127
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,960
and can help in in privacy protection

1128
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,319
there is one thing so that should be

1129
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,599
considered is uh

1130
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,680
where the data goes

1131
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,599
uh because the fact that you have an

1132
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,200
oblivious methodology in order to to to

1133
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,480
obfuscate some things doesn't mean that

1134
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,960
you are

1135
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,160
gdpr compliant because uh you you have

1136
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,680
also to consider

1137
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,240
where actually you do that how you do

1138
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
that and then coming to play the logs

1139
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,680
that you keep in order to for

1140
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,359
accountability

1141
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,480
so

1142
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,160
does it make sense my

1143
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,040
my answer but

1144
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,280
we can chat more it's a very interesting

1145
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,520
question but it's what complex i think

1146
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,640
to to discuss

1147
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,240
thank you again luigi for that

1148
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,680
presentation that's great and again

1149
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,760
there's some further discussion in the

1150
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,520
chat that uh

1151
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,920
you may want to follow up with yeah sure

1152
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,880
thank you

1153
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,559
thanks very much

1154
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,000
okay and a final presentation is from

1155
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,599
mallory um

1156
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,160
it's an update of the

1157
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,680
survey of worldwide censorship

1158
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,559
techniques draft so plea do you you have

1159
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,920
slides you want to show you on screen

1160
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,960
uh i do have slides i just requested to

1161
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,839
um

1162
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:00,960
share them

1163
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,720
yeah there we go

1164
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,839
thank you so much

1165
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,040
yeah all right

1166
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,040
thanks and thanks for time on the agenda

1167
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,440
this is a research group document if

1168
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,520
people recall i'm presenting it only

1169
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,839
because um the other authors who've

1170
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,440
worked on this draft for a very long

1171
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,520
time no longer have the capacity to

1172
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,800
continue working on it so um

1173
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,160
a lot of the content in the slides and

1174
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,920
the draft itself is not written by me

1175
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,119
but um

1176
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,680
i am it's steward at the moment happily

1177
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,079
so yeah joe hall um he was originally in

1178
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,520
my position at cdc when he started

1179
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,440
writing this uh

1180
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,400
in november 2014. so that's quite some

1181
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,559
time i think one of the challenges of

1182
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,720
this draft is that of course it's a you

1183
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,800
know contentious topic uses the word

1184
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,319
censorship throughout it's not something

1185
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,319
that atf is used to talking about but

1186
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,640
also that um the more time that passes

1187
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,200
the more sort of techniques

1188
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,079
can be added refined you know so at some

1189
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,240
point i think there's a recognition

1190
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,760
this has been made this this has been

1191
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,559
recognized multiple times in um perigee

1192
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,440
that um it just has to sort of be uh

1193
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,640
published so we're working towards a

1194
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,079
document that is good enough to be

1195
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,440
published but also

1196
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,720
um you know has sort of a time stamp on

1197
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,079
it when it does get published and

1198
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,760
everything that sort of evolves after

1199
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,400
that can be captured in a different way

1200
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,240
um

1201
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,359
so yeah there's it's gone through one

1202
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,680
research group last call

1203
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,480
we'd like to by the end of this

1204
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,800
presentation and then on the list very

1205
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,800
soon move to another last call that's my

1206
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,079
goal here

1207
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,839
we're now on

1208
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,079
the fifth version since the research

1209
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,240
group adopted it and the changes that

1210
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,440
we've made most recently

1211
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,599
have been to scale back the section on

1212
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,760
self-censorship to the bare minimum

1213
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,280
there

1214
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,280
talked a bit more about domain seizure

1215
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,800
again like not under the sort of

1216
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,000
technical

1217
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,359
table of contents which i'll get to in a

1218
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,280
second and then

1219
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,760
we now also talk about how

1220
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,760
tls 1.3

1221
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,720
extensions are sometimes being blocked

1222
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,119
that's again an example of how the

1223
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,520
longer we wait the more new and novel

1224
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,119
ways to block the internet um arise

1225
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,960
uh so the

1226
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,760
um

1227
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,520
contents the summary of the draft it's

1228
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,520
in essentially um

1229
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,240
four parts there's a section that sort

1230
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,559
of helps to define what to block

1231
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,119
um then that's followed by a section on

1232
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,480
how to detect

1233
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,400
what to block after you've defined it

1234
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,079
and then the last part is really about

1235
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,920
the actions that you can take to block

1236
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,960
it

1237
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,720
um and then there's some

1238
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,520
um

1239
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,599
discussion of how the network is layered

1240
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,079
and and how that um

1241
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,480
actually matches yeah i just saw a list

1242
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,200
of

1243
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,720
point in the chat which is absolutely

1244
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,319
right we've talked a lot about how this

1245
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,319
could be a living document but also

1246
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,319
how it might be useful to to actually

1247
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,200
get

1248
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,720
it published once and then think about

1249
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,359
how to keep it up to date so we are

1250
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,200
tracking this in github

1251
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,760
you can see the open issues

1252
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,880
um these this is a just sort of um

1253
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,040
list of what's open and in my analysis

1254
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,599
of the way to move forward so um

1255
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,319
actually since i

1256
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,799
submitted the most recent version um

1257
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,319
ecker has given some really great

1258
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,240
suggestions to how to figure out

1259
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,799
issue 81 on the tls identification piece

1260
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:29,839
um

1261
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,079
there's been an open issue for quite a

1262
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,599
while just to sort of incorporate i

1263
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,760
think this very relevant report thanks

1264
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,000
to chris wood for pointing that one out

1265
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,400
um there has been some treatment on

1266
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,480
issue 64

1267
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,520
about

1268
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,480
the

1269
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,960
issue around tls um

1270
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,079
and it's just that the original um

1271
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,599
the person who opened the issue chelsea

1272
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,440
um needs to review kind of the change we

1273
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,359
did and whether or not she's satisfied

1274
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,200
with that that there are two other

1275
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,599
issues that are still open and i would

1276
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,920
actually um i'm here i'm coming here to

1277
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,839
you to recommend that we drop them one

1278
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,480
is um to introduce this concept of

1279
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,240
sensor maturity because again i think

1280
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,599
this is something that maybe changes

1281
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,319
over time i'm not sure it adds a great

1282
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,799
deal and i also i'm just not very sure

1283
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,880
or clear what the text on sensor

1284
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,040
maturity should be since there's not

1285
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,799
been a suggestion

1286
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,880
and then the other one i suggest

1287
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,079
dropping

1288
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,559
um is changing so throughout the

1289
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,200
document we have a sort of trade-offs

1290
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,839
caveat under most subsections meaning

1291
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,160
that you know there's a cost

1292
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,040
to

1293
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,640
the censorship of some degree um and

1294
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,400
there's just been a suggestion that we

1295
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,400
changed that terminology from trade-off

1296
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,359
to cost to implement but i'm actually

1297
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,040
looking at the text i don't think that

1298
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,280
the terminology change is really

1299
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,880
warranted and also it would require us

1300
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,960
to do more word smithing because then we

1301
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,319
tend to say

1302
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,880
trade-off colon the cost to implement

1303
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,000
this you know so it would be really

1304
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,839
redundant and kind of

1305
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,920
um yeah i'm just not i'm just not

1306
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,440
convinced that it's really worth making

1307
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,520
the change um

1308
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,839
so anyway that so like i said we're

1309
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,760
waiting for the re-review on issue 64.

1310
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,160
we know that we need to incorporate 81

1311
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,359
55 and 64 into the next version and then

1312
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,040
we'll go to the list

1313
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,599
right after that's done um and hopefully

1314
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,079
ask the chairs for another last call but

1315
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,040
um

1316
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,680
wanted to stop there i think to ask if

1317
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,799
there were any questions or comments

1318
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,640
um

1319
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,319
thanks again for the time we have like

1320
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,160
three minutes left i think

1321
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,079
thanks mallory are there any questions

1322
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,599
from the

1323
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,400
meeting today

1324
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,400
otherwise i think i can um to say from

1325
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,240
the chair point of view we're very keen

1326
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,520
to see

1327
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,440
uh this version move forward now that

1328
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,599
there's been some action on it again so

1329
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:54,640
we would be

1330
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,880
uh very keen to have a discussion about

1331
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,720
setting a provisional date for getting

1332
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,760
to the next research group last call so

1333
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,319
that we have some time-based targets

1334
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,880
to move this forward because as you say

1335
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,200
it really needs to be published

1336
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,440
at this point in time so perhaps we can

1337
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,359
we can chat about offline

1338
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,559
when yeah

1339
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,480
reasonable i think it should be

1340
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,799
fairly imminent really it's just i feel

1341
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,119
really confident that the changes i need

1342
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,599
to make i can make it's just i need the

1343
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,359
reviewers who originally raised them to

1344
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,119
just give me their stamp of approval

1345
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,880
because i want to get it right and i

1346
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,799
would just also say i forgot to sort of

1347
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,079
say this in the presentation and maybe

1348
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,760
it's only tangentially relevant but

1349
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,799
there's also

1350
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,839
a new brand new zero zero draft that's

1351
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,520
going to be presented i think three

1352
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,200
times at ietf 113 on ip blocking this is

1353
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,559
i think you know reading between the

1354
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:45,839
lines in response to some of the

1355
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,559
requests that have been made of

1356
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,000
various infrastruct internet

1357
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
infrastructure to um

1358
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,200
action russia's behavior um during its

1359
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,400
war on ukraine and that's a good draft

1360
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,839
if folks want to read it i think there's

1361
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:01,599
some overlap here there's definitely

1362
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,520
some stuff in the ip blocking space that

1363
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,599
isn't in this draft so i don't want to

1364
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,359
open that whole can of worms i just want

1365

people to be aware of it and to note you

1366
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,240
