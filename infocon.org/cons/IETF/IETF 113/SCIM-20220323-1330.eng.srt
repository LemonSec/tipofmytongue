1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,719
okay

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,480
and

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,480
actress

4
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,879
so

5
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,360
for for those who are coming in you can

6
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,799
use the

7
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,240
meat echo from the phone by

8
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,720
scanning in the barcode outside

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,640
i find that it works easiest if you're

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
on your laptop to just use the meat echo

11
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,119
from your browser

12
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,479
so i think we should get started i think

13
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,479
with that we can get started

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400

15
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,360

we used to have blue sheets but since

52
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,959
this is hybrid it's mainly taken off the

53
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,959
meet echo attendance so this is where i

54
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,000
encourage you if you want your

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,599

to get into

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,640
meet echo

58
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
and there is a chat room too

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
that you can get to through the little

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,159
bubble chat in the meat echo or you can

61
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,840
use jabber

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519

we also have a code of conduct which is

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,440

one more note

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,319

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840

83
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,880
agenda bash

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,000
um

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,360
i believe we have a couple of volunteers

86
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,960
already

87
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,520
for the minute takers so

88
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,720
thank you ned

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,840

90
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
pam

91
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,560
but you're kind of partial since you're

92
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,120
covering the first one um and so i

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,800
encourage i put the link here

94
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,040
where the minutes are being taken which

95
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
is in a hackmd

96
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,080
hedgedock link

97
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,160
i encourage everyone

98
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,320
to review those as well because those

99
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
are our recorded minutes

100
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,040
next slide

101
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,759
okay so on to the agenda

102
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,080
um

103
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,680
on our charter

104
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
the first things off the gate is for us

105
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,960
to update the use cases the protocol and

106
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,280
the base protocol and schema

107
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
and we have assigned editors for them so

108
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,160
i've asked them to provide

109
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,479
updates and progress on those

110
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,039
we actually have elliot also who is

111
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,880
focusing on iot he will be speaking to

112
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,680
the use cases and applicability of skim

113
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
for iot

114
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,960
and then

115
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,560
phil has posted a draft on how

116
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
skim is a profile that can be shared

117
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,280
using the shared signals and events

118
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,080
so

119
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,240
if he needs my help i will step down and

120
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,639
aaron can take over cheering

121
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,720
to help him present

122
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
a little bit of background about shared

123
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
signals and events otherwise fondly

124
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,720
known as sse

125
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
um but he will be presenting the skin

126
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,199
profiles for that

127
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,880
um so that is the agenda unless anybody

128
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,080
has any changes or comments

129
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,800
it is the agenda bash time going once

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,880
going twice

131
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,880
all right so with that

132
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
i will have pam come up

133
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,560
and i of course let me bring up

134
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,680
unless you want to share

135
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,800
hi everybody i'm pam dingle from

136
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
microsoft if you look in the chat in

137
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,000
meet echo there's a hack md link there

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,199
that is

139
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,720
basically a

140
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,120
an outline bash for the use cases and

141
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
concepts document

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,039
so my hope is today in this time we just

143
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,759
we go through that we confirm whether

144
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,840
this is in general the right thing and

145
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,199
whether there's missing pieces and

146
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,160
people

147
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,759
please feel free to

148
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,039
add to this

149
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,720
better if you don't delete but if you do

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
think something should be deleted

151
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
type it in the text and that way we'll

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,400
we'll reckon you know

153
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
we'll cover that so just a little bit of

154
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
of background

155
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,120
uh if for any of you who are not aware

156
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,319
and many people are not uh the rfc

157
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,479
series for skim is actually three

158
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,479
documents not two so there's a

159
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,759
specification called rfc 7642

160
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,400
which is meant to be an overviews use

161
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,880
concepts uh use cases and concepts

162
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,800
however you know in the

163
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
in the working group process in that

164
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,199
last um effort

165
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,720
that that document really served a

166
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
different purpose at least as i

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
understood it i wasn't part of that so i

168
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,879
don't want to speak for that group

169
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,120
but the uh you know

170
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,319
it it helped to form what went into the

171
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,479
protocol you know into 76

172
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,360
43 and 76 44

173
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
but it didn't get upgrade updated at the

174
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,319
end

175
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,840
and so the document

176
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,479
doesn't cover all of the concepts that

177
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,680
we believe

178
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,000
an implementer white might need to know

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,360
in order to

180
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
come in and

181
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,720
understand the specification and be able

182
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,599
to implement to it so the goal here at

183
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,520
least as i understand it

184
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,800
is

185
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,720
to describe you know the existing rfcs

186
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,680
um in an updated internet draft you know

187
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
or an updated draft

188
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,640
um that is closer to the actual concepts

189
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,120
that you know that are modern today so

190
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,479
that we could have implementers more

191
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,559
easily understand the specification

192
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,519
so let me just check before i go further

193
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
does that make sense to everyone is

194
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
there anyone who wants to

195
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,160
comment on the goal

196
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,040
all right i'll take you're always

197
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,680
welcome to add add more or or contact us

198
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,959
after of course and or post to the list

199
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,880
uh so

200
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
so here's hold on pam oh we've got a

201
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
hypothesis on the queue oh sorry quick

202
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
question um

203
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,480
if you want someone so

204
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,560
one of the things that i get asked a lot

205
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,560
is uh open api swagger um

206
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
api specs for first game is that on the

207
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,640
table have people talked about that i

208
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,959
haven't been following this closely but

209
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,519
sorry say that again lately open api

210
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,720
specs

211
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
for first game is that on the table

212
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
i i mean this is one of the things that

213
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,640
gets brought up a lot right today right

214
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
among implementers who sort of look at

215
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
scam and go ah

216
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
looks like a doesn't look like a modern

217
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,240
api it doesn't have the open api specs

218
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,839
right i can't code to that because i

219
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,519
have to write every all the interfaces

220
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,320
myself right it is what it is right so

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,120
i'm my question is whether that's

222
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,519
part of the part of the charter

223
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,160
explicitly or we we did not make it

224
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,000
explicit in the time didn't consider it

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,440
or you know

226
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
we definitely consider i mean generally

227
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
in the groups that i've chaired we try

228
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,519
and use existing

229
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,839
as opposed to

230
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,959
creating um

231
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959
api's interfaces so

232
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,480
it's something we can consider right

233
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,279
yeah that's actually a great idea

234
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,800
um okay so when it so what you can see

235
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,560
if you look at the heck him dean oh is

236
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,359
there no elliott

237
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,839
hi just um

238
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,000
this good good afternoon good morning

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,839
everyone um

240
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,720
good evening to those further east

241
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,680
uh just a slightly dissenting

242
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,600
point of view on open api and swagger

243
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,839
um i'm not sure that it actually is rich

244
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,640
enough and stands up uh to some of these

245
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
cases that we'll discuss later so leaf i

246
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,720
would be very interested in your

247
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,240
comments when when i come around to

248
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,440
talking about iot okay

249
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,519
yeah elliott is as the chair i didn't

250
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,160
mean to infer that we would adopt those

251
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,040
open api it's more the question as a

252
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
group we shouldn't be as closed-minded

253
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,760
right but your point is well taken

254
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,040
i think at least we would want to

255
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,760
evaluate right and half rationale pros

256
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,480
and cons yeah

257
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
okay so

258
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
what you see here is a and it you know a

259
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
first attempt to make the outline for

260
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,440
the use cases and concepts diagrams

261
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,320
uh or uh sorry um the you know the

262
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,560
headings if you will for the document

263
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,920
and so what they really represent are

264
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,640
the concepts that we actually think

265
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,880
implementers would need to understand in

266
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
order to understand how to use skim

267
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
um right now i have roughly

268
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,079
um created some rationales around these

269
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,839
as far as definitions go um i believe we

270
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,760
probably don't want to redefine some of

271
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,160
the things in the normative specs

272
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
but we might want to define some of the

273
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,800
more

274
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
business-like use cases so for example i

275
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,880
have user management and group

276
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,600
management and provisioning listed here

277
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,480
right

278
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,639
so in the case where people maybe not

279
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,160
may not understand for example what

280
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,000
group management is

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
right it just it's just should be just

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
enough to help people

283
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,480
understand that that term is being used

284
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,320
so so you know any

285
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,360
any definitions that would maybe not be

286
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,440
applicable in the normative spec

287
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,519
but would be useful for the overall

288
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,959
understanding of the concept would go

289
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,399
here

290
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,560
the next section is the concepts section

291
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,200
and so i believe that these are

292
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
basic

293
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,279
concepts around provisioning right

294
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,320
around

295
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
um

296
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
you know some of the industry ideas so

297
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,720
what is

298
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,399
us you know what does it mean to have a

299
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,000
start of authority

300
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,639
right so this you know being able to say

301
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
that a given entity is authoritative for

302
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,720
an attribute

303
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,120
right or authoritative for an account

304
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,480
is sort of the idea behind start of

305
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,760
authority

306
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,920
data directionality so the idea of of

307
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,000
are you is it master slave were you just

308
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,240
pushing things straight out or is it a

309
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
bi-directional sharing because in the

310
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,480
case of bi-directional sharing it

311
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,079
obviously matters on an attribute by

312
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,079
attribute basis

313
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,839
which party in the transaction is

314
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,920
authoritative for what

315
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,800
um

316
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,399
so that one's very loaded and may

317
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,959
deserve a section of its own um just in

318
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,560
time provisioning

319
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,040
so a definition of what just in the time

320
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
provisioning is for

321
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,600
so that it can be used later

322
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
schema and resource types so sort of the

323
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,560
object model

324
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
mutability and uniqueness

325
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,399
so again not just what they are not just

326
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,200
a definition but an explanation of why

327
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,639
they're necessary in provisioning

328
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,320
scenarios right and of course

329
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,040
immutability and uniqueness then affect

330
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
data you know start of authority and

331
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,800
data directionality so these things

332
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,680
become

333
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,880
linked to each other

334
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
identifiers and primary keys so in this

335
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,160
case the understanding of for example

336
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
why

337
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,000
in scheme we have to have an external id

338
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
right

339
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,160
we can kind of we can put some

340
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
explanation in there

341
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,199
um

342
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,240
api security which is typoed

343
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,000
so under api security my thought was

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
just explaining how

345
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,480
a skim endpoint can be secured right

346
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,639
just again just enough information some

347
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,240
of this if you feel like it's too

348
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,519
obvious

349
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,360
please just add a comment in the

350
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
document because there's you know

351
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,000
there's just a question of where do you

352
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,279
draw the line

353
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,760
for what's to what's you can

354
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
realistically expect these folks to know

355
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,760
about

356
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,079
hard and soft deletion i think is

357
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,639
another concept that that it would help

358
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,720
to have people know in advance when they

359
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,560
try to plan their implementations

360
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,639
and then privilege elevation

361
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,639
so those are the concepts so i guess the

362
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
first question i would have is

363
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,760
a does anybody want to comment on

364
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,120
the level

365
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
right the the altitude

366
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,279
of these concepts do they make sense you

367
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,880
know it's sort of an industry altitude

368
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,160
is everyone comfortable with that

369
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,519
do you want us to run forward

370
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,079
yeah we can run a poll um

371
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
if that's not hard to do

372
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,560
we could wait and

373
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,119
oh there we go

374
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,600
hi again

375
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
um

376
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,639
i i think these are good things i don't

377
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,519
know that they're an exhaustive list

378
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,480
um

379
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,079
and i don't know that they need to be at

380
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,519
this point

381
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,680
right i think that the question you

382
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,279
might want to be asking is does anybody

383
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,040
object to anything in this list and i

384
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
would be shocked if people did

385
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
but you might want to add to the list as

386
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,320
we develop things out a bit more

387
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,000
that makes sense also i might not be

388
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,759
using the right words right a lot of

389
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,759
these have synonyms and

390
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,240
and other uses so there might just be a

391
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,600
more evocative term for the same network

392
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,560
let me throw one example out you talk

393
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,720
about um

394
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
data directionality

395
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,519
uh

396
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,000
putting this the schema aside right

397
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,519
let's talk about

398
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,040
uh connection directionality right which

399
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,959
goes to the protocol

400
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,199
right is is

401
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,920
a restful protocol the the only way that

402
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,680
we want to do this or

403
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,600
are we thinking in terms of things like

404
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,079
grpc or web sockets where we might want

405
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,560
to reverse connectivity in some cases

406
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,160
and i'll give an example of that later

407
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,600
that's a great point

408
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,519
ned i hope you caught that

409
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,040
i can run a poll

410
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,519
and is the question does anyone object

411
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,360
to the use case list

412
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
to the concepts

413
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,920
concepts list

414
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,279
as the starting point for the

415
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,160
yes use case draft and the next step

416
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,399
will be that this goes into a draft and

417
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,399
gets posted and then you know we will

418
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,320
have full editorial

419
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
control for people to add i mean they

420
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,639
can you're welcome to add here but

421
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,920
obviously there'll be

422
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,520
lots of steps in the future also

423
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,439
okay is the poll running

424
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,640
it's running i think it's good 18

425
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
answers

426
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,760
i think you don't see it cause you

427
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,839
started it oh yeah

428
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,160
but it says start session oh i feel like

429
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,039
we should have music

430
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,640
no you don't want me

431
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,880
um

432
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,000
that's right

433
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,640
yeah so so you can choose do not raise

434
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
your hand if you have issues with the

435
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,120
list

436
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,400
i think the only issue there is if

437
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
people just maybe are not connected does

438
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
that mean they are by default not

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,840
raising their hand

440
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,240
okay

441
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,000
is everybody apathetic or did i not run

442
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,760
the poll correct i think we have 29 out

443
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
of 29 so i think i think we're good

444
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,400
yeah

445
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,039
oh okay

446
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
no nancy to help you with the with the

447
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,120
process check

448
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,720
this is roman speaking i think you ran

449
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,480
the poll right i mean my read is

450
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
everyone you know you know universally

451
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
agrees that we have a pretty great

452
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,360
starting point

453
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,640
great perfect

454
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,919
okay all right so let's have your

455
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,400
guidance great let's keep so let's keep

456
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,799
going um how am i for time uh you're

457
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,440
doing great you're great

458
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
okay so the next one is use cases and

459
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
this was uh and i think that

460
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,200
not the last interim meeting but the one

461
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,520
before we had a conversation about this

462
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,080
um what does a use case mean and so the

463
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,919
def the rationale that i've gone with

464
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,720
here

465
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,120
is what are the chunks of of skim

466
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,840
functionality right that is that people

467
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,520
might want to achieve right so it's not

468
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
a business use case it is an

469
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,840
implementation use case and so what

470
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,440
you'll see here

471
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
the use cases include

472
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,720
negotiating schema it includes uh search

473
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
and query

474
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,280
um object synchronization life cycle

475
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,039
and and then massive data set

476
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,760
maintenance so i mean that's a huge like

477
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,160
those four things are massive

478
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,120
and can be broken down into subsections

479
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,039
um but i don't have a sense of whether

480
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,520
they're in any way

481
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
enough right

482
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,640
like i don't know that they're all

483
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
sufficient

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,679
um i do you know i do believe the

485
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,320
massive you know that that management at

486
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
scale

487
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,480
is a theme that we want to spend time on

488
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
right because that includes pagination

489
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,280
it includes how do you bootstrap

490
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,679
um a connection in the first place

491
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,360
um eating you know includes how do you

492
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,280
do bulk operations

493
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,120
all of that

494
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,440
um but we may want to break that up

495
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,280
like if there's a smarter way to break

496
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
that into pieces

497
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,760
then we might want to do that

498
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,000
right so and then you know so one is

499
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
sort of a life cycle that really the

500
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,799
idea of managing a given object in skim

501
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,720
which is how do you create it how do you

502
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,240
read it how do you update it how do you

503
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,360
delete it

504
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,280
right and then the second one is now how

505
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,440
do you do these things across

506
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,320
that massive scale

507
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
all right so i'm not hearing too many

508
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,559
people does anyone want to comment or is

509
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,559
there an obvious one here of all of you

510
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,640
who are implementing

511
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,840
is there an obvious thing that you're

512
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,600
doing today that i that isn't even

513
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,440
mentioned here yeah i mean feel free to

514
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,000
come up and join the queue and we got

515
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,360
janelle tooth

516
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,240
so janelle you're in the queue

517
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,399
janelle are you on mute

518
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,200
here she comes

519
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,640
hello

520
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,039
there we go now we hear you

521
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,080
hi

522
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,880
um

523
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,240
i think you've raised some really

524
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,720
excellent points here i think one of the

525
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,200
other things is that there's some data

526
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
that we've come across

527
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
that may need protection especially when

528
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,640
it's a url that's being transferred like

529
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,880
a url to a photo

530
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,640
this has come up

531
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,559
on occasion on separate notes danny has

532
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,000
brought it up separately so there might

533
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,760
be some you know how do we deal with

534
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,280
sensitive data

535
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,919
in the data sets or or how you know how

536
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,520
do you gain access to it as another item

537
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,960
okay that and that one might fit in the

538
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,600
next section as well so i might just

539
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,039
skip to the next section and then have

540
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,440
everyone comment on mass unless oh wait

541
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
we have another one we have a

542
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
comment

543
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,360
hi this is hansjorg um sorry for

544
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,520
interrupting right now no no that sounds

545
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,600
good it's meant to be a discussion so if

546
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,520
i do a peek preview of the next section

547
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,120
already i find actually the use cases

548
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,960
this way a little technical so for

549
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,280
instance if i see user self-service

550
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,600
um i actually wonder like you know skim

551
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,320
in the general sense for me reads like

552
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,480
more like an enterprising math thing

553
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,039
which is also reflected in the use cases

554
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,640
in the technical part here but

555
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,000
self-service on the other hand doesn't

556
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,080
seem to be reflected in the use cases so

557
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,320
far or would probably fit in in some way

558
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,520
okay

559
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,799
yeah that's a great point they're

560
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,960
definitely pretty technical

561
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,400
um can would you be willing to add uh

562
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,080
put put an example in that you think

563
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,240
would be i can try yeah that would be

564
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,159
great

565
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,240
that this is the you know the

566
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,000
more points of view the better for sure

567
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
fantastic

568
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,559
okay well then yeah let's go through the

569
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,080
use cases

570
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,480
um i so i you know the comment i think

571
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,240
is that

572
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,919
that it's okay if one of these two

573
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,600
sections is is

574
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,520
geeky but they shouldn't both be right

575
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
like in some sense you want

576
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,919
my hope for the scenarios was to

577
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,159
essentially tie some of the geeky things

578
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,120
together

579
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,520
into end-to-end scenarios that would

580
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,600
resonate with an implementer

581
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,919
so you know i think this is where anyone

582
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,559
who is implementing if you're not seeing

583
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,919
a thing that resonates with you then

584
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,240
it's clearly the wrong list

585
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
so so we'll just quickly go through

586
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,080
those example scenarios

587
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,840
so the first one i think

588
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,559
is our canonical

589
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,720
example however that just might reflect

590
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,919
my bias

591
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,200
so

592
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,440
um it says uh so a sas app writes a

593
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,679
multi-tenant integration to get data

594
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,960
from a cloud platform and i've i've

595
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,039
set it up to be any cloud platform so

596
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,720
that i could highlight how schema

597
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,600
negotiation or how dynamics schema

598
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
checking could work

599
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,640
um i again don't know if that's

600
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,760
realistic

601
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,520
i know it's not a commonly used feature

602
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,240
but

603
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,320
in some sense if we can talk through

604
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,799
some of the less commonly used things

605
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
then in theory it would help people know

606
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,880
how to use them

607
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,960
so yeah so that so in that case that we

608
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
would write something nice about

609
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
negotiating schema

610
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
understanding how to do an initial

611
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,919
download you know an initial

612
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,280
synchronization

613
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,120
of account and group data

614
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,559
right and then maybe

615
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,480
you know after some amount of time

616
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,440
perform

617
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
a full-on reconciliation

618
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,320
um to make those things to be sure those

619
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,679
things match

620
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,440
right so the implication i have when i

621
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,200
say reconciliation

622
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,279
is that maybe the service

623
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,679
uh halted for a minute and we you know

624
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,640
you you lost access so you weren't sure

625
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,880
if every skim command was received for

626
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,200
example and i believe that's i mean

627
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,120
that's a concern that we've heard talked

628
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,279
about in the various meetings right

629
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,679
um how do i know if i've missed

630
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,640
something

631
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,760
um and

632
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,440
you know the difference in my mind

633
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,960
between reconciliation and an

634
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
incremental update

635
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,919
is one is a brute force

636
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,320
uh download and the other one is is a

637
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,679
mechanism

638
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,000
for knowing what the delta might be

639
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,360
between what you have and what you wish

640
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,480
you had

641
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,159
uh okay so the next one is progressive

642
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,640
profiling which uh you know the idea

643
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
behind that is would be customer you

644
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,320
know a siam

645
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,200
customer identity kind of use case where

646
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,039
you would in fact want to collect data

647
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,520
directly from a user and then write it

648
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,400
back uh to an authoritative source

649
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,520
um so you know imagine you go to

650
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,679
go to buy a car and because you've only

651
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,520
been a

652
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
you know a marketing subscriber up until

653
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,520
that point they need to ask for some

654
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,919
in-line important data before they can

655
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
continue with the purchase

656
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
that's the progressive profiling use

657
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,720
case

658
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
and then yeah the user self-service

659
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
would be the idea that you go manage

660
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
your profile you know web page or web

661
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,159
portal and then that data then gets

662
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,600
pushed through

663
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,959
you know through the chain

664
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,960
and then

665
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
the last three so the first one is a

666
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,240
bulk address change and my thought here

667
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,080
is that it would be large enough scale

668
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,720
so we could discuss pagination

669
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,799
it would be um

670
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,559
you would want to search with a filter

671
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,240
right to only find

672
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,000
users who have a building that matches

673
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,720
the

674
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,279
old building that we're moving out of

675
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,559
and

676
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,799
that you would then change the data in

677
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,640
the address by running you know a patch

678
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,000
of a bulk a bulk update operation

679
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,240
uh incrementally to change only those

680
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,279
accounts

681
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,640
that have you know that where the

682
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,600
building has changed

683
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,640
and then the last two

684
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
um so we have no group management right

685
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,840
now at all

686
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,919
in the use cases and concepts

687
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,000
so you know getting enough information

688
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,919
there that people can understand the

689
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,320
trade-offs for managing massive groups

690
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,080
is a big deal so

691
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,120
this idea of how do you replace a user

692
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,159
or a member in a in a group that has a

693
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,240
million users how do you do that without

694
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,200
literally

695
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,880
doing a get of every single user and

696
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,000
then

697
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,520
having to

698
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,159
change only one attribute

699
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,520
and then the last one is the idea of

700
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
extending schema so that is again

701
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,640
something that isn't in the use cases

702
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,120
and concepts so just giving a story that

703
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,639
normalizes how that can happen

704
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
so after all of that so it's basically

705
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,919
just storytelling

706
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,080
at the end of the day

707
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,840
um so maybe we can run a poll

708
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,919
again you're welcome to add more stuff

709
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,840
like either more detail to the stories

710
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,158
or suggestions for different stories

711
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,080
if you know anything you can do up front

712
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,480
now just means that the initial draft

713
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
will reflect it and you'll always have

714
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,400
the chance to change it later

715
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,760
but

716
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,960
so is this content sufficient

717
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,960
right to serve as a base draft

718
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,720
sounds like a good poll

719
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,799
oh we have someone on the queue too

720
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,200
oh antoine you're in the queue

721
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,799
ah hello

722
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,720
oh you're never telling me

723
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,159
so um i completely forgot during the

724
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,320
for those that are on site to manage the

725
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,919
queue they also do it on the media code

726
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,799
i had some use cases coming from

727
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,330
iot and cellular network background

728
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,760
[Music]

729
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,679
how do you manage the change of

730
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,360
ownership on devices is something that i

731
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,600
think could be interesting because if

732
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,720
obviously in business use cases you have

733
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
to change ownership for a set of objects

734
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,279
from one person to another

735
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,640
and uh

736
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,200
one thing that is also important

737
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,080
from my perspective is to manage the

738
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,799
the fact that company fails

739
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,080
and

740
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,720
objects are in the field for 20 years so

741
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,360
how do you change the authority that

742
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,919
manages the keys and the trust

743
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,320
relationship for a given set of objects

744
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,840
i think

745
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,720
those two aspects are very important

746
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,880
things to consider if you want to go in

747
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
iot

748
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,520
oh you you you uh i expected you to stay

749
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,039
in the queue as i thought you might

750
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,360
answer

751
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,159
elliott you're back on the queue

752
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,399
yeah i i typed something into the chat i

753
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,360
was going to say pam um that i wonder if

754
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,679
we could defer paul the poll on this

755
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,000
part of the discussion until after the

756
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,559
iot presentation because you'll probably

757
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,480
want to pick something up i'm not going

758
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,039
to try and tell you how to format every

759
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,480
last thing here

760
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
right i just think

761
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,760
there's there's going to be food for

762
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,880
thought

763
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,919
um after that presentation and and some

764
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,919
digesting may need to happen as well

765
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,600
yeah that's a great idea

766
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,360
yeah i'm happy to

767
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,440
call this section done and

768
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,600
you know i mean as elliott says we can

769
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,360
run a poll to give you guidance if you

770
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,640
still need it okay um because elliot is

771
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,799
i put elliott next because he also has a

772
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,320
use case right to address the iot okay

773
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,240
great well in that case thank you very

774
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,080
much for your time i really appreciate

775
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,720
it

776
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,919
awesome

777
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,399
we got some time back

778
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,480
all right so next up is elliott

779
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,159
so elliot did you want to share your

780
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,399
slides or do you want us to

781
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,559
do do you mind if you share them that

782
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,720
way uh i think it's probably just as

783
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,039
easy

784
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,559
all right so um i did up these use cases

785
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,000
with janelle

786
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,039
um who i will now use as an example next

787
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,520
slide please

788
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,799
so

789
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,399
how are these things how are these

790
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,919
identities different and how are they

791
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,399
the same

792
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,880
each of these identities require

793
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,399
credentials it so happens that janelle

794
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,360
has a lot more capability to prove

795
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,720
herself

796
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,960
she has fingers eyes

797
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,919
um and and the ability to type

798
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,720
and um

799
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,640
the the light bulb doesn't

800
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,559
right there's no user interface on the

801
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,840
light bulb there's no

802
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,360
um means

803
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,720
for the light bulb to to provide

804
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,440
uh any a lot of context

805
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,240
just

806
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
visually other than blinking or

807
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,279
something

808
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,840
next

809
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,360
slide so

810
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,000
this is a big problem in in terms of

811
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,080
just getting things on board

812
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,760
uh to network um we want things to

813
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,960
seamlessly be able to use wi-fi

814
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,559
we want

815
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,519
um

816
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,600
things to be able to seamlessly use

817
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,000
different connection technologies

818
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,840
and for those people who've been paying

819
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
attention to the the side meetings that

820
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,440
we've been having and the meetings we've

821
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,120
had in the um

822
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,799
iot ops group

823
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,600
um

824
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,360
the nice thing about onboarding

825
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,480
standards

826
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,440
is that there are so many of them

827
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
so um

828
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,760
the the key question is right um

829
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,279
you know here we have a provisioning

830
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,120
thing we know we need to provide some

831
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,000
information about the device

832
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
into a local environment

833
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,120
um we might need to delete all devices

834
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,080
um we there may be a need to update

835
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,760
existing devices

836
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,799
um

837
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,919
and there might be a need to um

838
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,120
uh to group devices i say maybe mites

839
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,279
you're hearing a little bit of hedging

840
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,960
because i think we're just getting going

841
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,240
in the context of skim

842
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,640
the the question is why not use skim and

843
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,679
so

844
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,360
we wanted to start with at least the

845
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,439
concept and see where it goes

846
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,320
next slide please

847
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,159
so uh this is a fairly uh texty slide i

848
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,600
apologize for that

849
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,559
uh

850
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,320
but the key thing here is that we want

851
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,960
to be able to do as much automation

852
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
of uh provisioning as possible

853
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,039
so the the basic notion is you buy

854
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,399
something

855
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,279
um

856
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,840
it should even be possible to automate

857
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,640
the

858
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,279
uh transfer of credentials

859
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,039
relating to a device

860
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,679
and what's important to understand

861
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,720
is that devices need proof that they're

862
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,960
connecting to the right place

863
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,440
as much as the network needs proof

864
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,600
or an or an application needs proof that

865
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,720
a device is allowed to talk to it

866
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
um the industry really wants a standard

867
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
approach to that and as i mentioned

868
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,039
there are many different standards

869
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,440
i've listed a couple of here

870
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,519
this has a lot of implications in terms

871
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,120
of schema design

872
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,799
right um

873
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,200
the company i work for cisco uh

874
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,960
used to have a slogan i don't know if

875
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,640
it's still out there

876
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,440
no technology religion well

877
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,200
we don't want to have to make choices

878
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,120
about technology at this level we want

879
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,720
we want to have an expansive view at

880
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
this moment in time

881
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,799
maybe later on in life there will be

882
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,559
consolidation but that's certainly not

883
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,760
where we are

884
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,559
not only in terms of l2 technology but

885
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,399
even on top of l2

886
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,799
um in terms of the mechanisms that are

887
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,720
used to provision things

888
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,080
so as you see

889
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,320
below right there

890
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,080
to provision on to wi-fi you might use

891
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,120
dpp or you might find a way to use 8366

892
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,200
vouchers or you might find a way to do

893
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,120
other means of provisioning for ble you

894
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,519
might use the oob mechanisms that are

895
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,240
defined you might do some weird thing

896
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,799
with pairing keys which has been done

897
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:07,760
out there

898
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,159
and you might use fido fdo vouchers for

899
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,440
any of this

900
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,280
so um

901
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,199
what this means is that we need a

902
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,000
certain amount of normalization

903
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,719
and

904
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,480
we might even need multiple levels of

905
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,239
normalization

906
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,480
um and this is something that i think

907
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,440
skim

908
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,320
presents a challenge for at the moment

909
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,359
um next slide

910
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,760
so just to to put this in a more graphic

911
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,560
view

912
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,239
right you have a device

913
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,199
um it might have wi-fi capabilities it

914
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,839
might have 802.3 capabilities and you

915
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,918
can just see this mesh of different

916
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,839
onboarding standards that might be used

917
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,560
in these different cases and so yeah

918
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,639
here again it's it's no technology

919
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,480
religion and this is sort of a use case

920
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,560
that we expect to have happen because

921
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,720
the console there is not likely to be a

922
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,200
consolidation anytime soon we just want

923
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,880
to be able to support whatever it is the

924
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,280
device happens to support

925
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,000
right and the key thing here is if we go

926
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,920
down that right side what does it mean

927
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,800
in terms of schema for dpp

928
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,720
this is device provisioning protocol by

929
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,359
the wi-fi alliance it's public key

930
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,200
that needs to be gotten that needs to be

931
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,880
transmitted into

932
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,040
uh the deployment so that the device

933
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,359
knows who that has the corresponding

934
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,560
private key

935
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,119
can do a cryptographic exchange to

936
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,640
establish trust

937
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,200
for 8366 this is a voucher from the

938
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,839
manufacturer saying hey device you you

939
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,000
should trust this deployment

940
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,240
fido has something very simple

941
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,680
very similar to an 8366 voucher which is

942
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,359
called fdo

943
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,200
ble oob is very similar to dpp in in

944
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,599
terms of using a public key and then key

945
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,440
pairs are of course sort of the poor

946
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,760
man's version of that

947
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,960
next slide please

948
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,200
so the other thing here that we noticed

949
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,880
elliott

950
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,599
you've got leaf on the queue

951
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,599
okay

952
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,880
hey uh come this might be

953
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,800
like

954
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,839
a clarifying question or not so you or

955
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,359
maybe something you're getting to later

956
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,520
and if so please stop me right but you

957
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,359
you mentioned that this

958
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,160
the all of the various types of key

959
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,040
material and device types would require

960
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,440
some sort of update to scan and to the

961
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,960
security

962
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,640
way we do security first game right

963
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,320
right now it's all i think it's

964
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,079
specified in terms of bearer tokens

965
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:36,880
right

966
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,040
and what i'm wondering is even if you

967
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,480
have all of this complexity on the

968
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,680
devices right you have some sort of key

969
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,720
couldn't you

970
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,440
like use a a

971
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,400
a token exchange token translator

972
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,440
approach

973
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,040
uh to like get yourself a job token and

974
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,880
use that to talk to the

975
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,040
scheme server so how is this a problem

976
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,640
for scam right the fact that you have

977
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,320
all of these yeah okay

978
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,359
so the issue here right is

979
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,400
we're not attempting in the iot use case

980
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,320
we're not attempting to modify the iot

981
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,640
devices themselves

982
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,839
right the use case in this case

983
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,800
is to take what the iot device offers

984
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,680
right and allow the local deployment to

985
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,000
have access to the necessary information

986
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,280
in order to onboard that device

987
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,000
sure but

988
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,040
understood but the iot device has some

989
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
key something right

990
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,720
right and what i'm trying to get at is

991
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,760
exactly

992
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,920
what how does this affect skim right

993
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,880
because

994
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,960
all you need to to feed to this game

995
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,280
server in order to make it happy is a a

996
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,520
bear token a jaw token or something

997
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,880
right and you can get that through any

998
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,200
kind of mechanism if you have access to

999
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,119
some sort of key material on the on the

1000
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,119
client so why does

1001
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,720
the fact that you have a

1002
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,200
a wide range of client types and key

1003
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,560
material why does that affect skim so

1004
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,160
it's a matter of

1005
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,520
what we're talking about here is

1006
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,320
creating a device hierarchy within skim

1007
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,040
if you will or device schema within skim

1008
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
right right so it's a schema it's a

1009
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,599
schema issue not an authentication issue

1010
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,000
it's a schema issue exactly right okay

1011
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,240
okay sorry i wasn't clear there

1012
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
tim cappelli is on thecube too and that

1013
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,440
trailed right into my comment i think

1014
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,960
the one thing i would say as someone who

1015
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,079
worked on the

1016
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,560
more of the non-headless device space

1017
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,160
this is not unique to iot and i think it

1018
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,320
should be positioned as devices right in

1019
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,560
a like if you look at a directory right

1020
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,079
we store billions of device

1021
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,160
relationships side-by-side with user

1022
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,920
objects that are not iot devices so it's

1023
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,400
really devices just absolutely just for

1024
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,880
the general general uh information

1025
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
okay i think you've called you've caught

1026
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,240
me out using the the letters i o and t

1027
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,520
together i only mean devices

1028
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,400
um

1029
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,079
so the other issue here is we see

1030
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,240
the need for directionality to be

1031
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,240
flipped in terms of who's talking to

1032
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,599
whom

1033
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,680
the use case that skim was initially

1034
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,400
designed for was you have an enterprise

1035
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,960
that's using some cloud-based service

1036
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,640
and you want to mass provision the

1037
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,480
cloud-based service based on the user

1038
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,560
base

1039
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,960
that that's in the enterprise

1040
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,280
in this case you might have partners

1041
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,680
that are providing or suppliers that are

1042
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,240
providing devices to the enterprise

1043
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,480
and in this case you actually want those

1044
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,400
guys to transmit the credentials that

1045
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,119
are necessary for the enterprise to make

1046
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,000
use of those devices

1047
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,960
so

1048
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,040
there's a little bit of a directionality

1049
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,079
issue

1050
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,640
right it's it's not add this user to

1051
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,960
your service it's add this device to

1052
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,200
your inventory

1053
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,160
is really what's being asked here

1054
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,880
and it's meant to be used in conjunction

1055
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
with the other mechanisms then to

1056
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,599
onboard the device on say the network or

1057
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,599
in applications

1058
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,160
next slide

1059
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,319
so

1060
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,760
there's a that this is not your your uh

1061
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
there was an old commercial in the 1980s

1062
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,040
that said this is not your father's

1063
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,880
buick well this is not your parent's

1064
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,000
skin

1065
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
right this is a little different

1066
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,240
um first of all bootstrapping credential

1067
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,800
movement is required

1068
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,720
uh in these cases in the cases that

1069
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,240
we're discussing it's not a it's not

1070
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,760
something that will happen sometimes

1071
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,040
it's something that's likely to happen

1072
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,359
every time

1073
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,480
um the supplier may be the skim client

1074
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,680
as opposed to you know a a service that

1075
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
the enterprise calls out although the

1076
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,440
connection and the the connection

1077
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,640
direction

1078
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
is something that we do need to discuss

1079
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,960
in a lot more detail

1080
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,640
um

1081
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
and uh

1082
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,920
the device identities uh here need to be

1083
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,440
clearly scoped um especially if you have

1084
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,680
supply multiple suppliers you don't want

1085
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
one supplier dinking with another

1086
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
supplier's stuff just and this is

1087
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,280
directly analogous to you don't if

1088
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,880
you're if you're a service like

1089
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,040
salesforce you don't want one

1090
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,119
enterprises

1091
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,119
provisioning operations impacting in

1092
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,480
other enterprises provisioning

1093
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,079
operations

1094
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,280
um

1095
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,680
the device attributes are going to vary

1096
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,599
um based on the capabilities of the

1097
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,680
device and this has schema implications

1098
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,720
um

1099
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,040
and there's likely to be a desire to

1100
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,960
carry other stuff so extensibility will

1101
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,040
remain important

1102
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,880
so examples that i give are software

1103
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,920
bill

1104
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
of materials information

1105
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,520
which is very hot right now it's very

1106
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,359
hot topic both in the u.s and europe

1107
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,520
device type information

1108
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,560
is another

1109
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,400
thing that enterprise administrators

1110
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,839
really want to have they don't just want

1111
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,599
to know that a device is being onboarded

1112
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,960
they want to know what the device is

1113
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,720
that's being onboarded

1114
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,640
um so they can they can understand how

1115
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,079
to deal with it

1116
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,079
these are some examples of variances

1117
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,079
that that you might see next slide

1118
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,680
so this raises a couple of questions

1119
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,880
right one question is um you know what

1120
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,560
is the relationship between users and

1121
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,720
devices then

1122
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,640
is there a notion of ownership here that

1123
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,240
has to be assigned

1124
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,119
and

1125
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,160
owners

1126
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,920
in the con

1127
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,000
certainly in the enterprise devices will

1128
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,520
have owners

1129
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,200
or people who are responsible for these

1130
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,800
things but it's not clear that the

1131
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
supplier has to actually

1132
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,839
um

1133
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,839
be the one that sets that and in fact

1134
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,079
probably the supplier doesn't so there

1135
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,200
but that doesn't mean there's no

1136
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,919
relationship

1137
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,520
the other question is uh as i went

1138
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,440
through this right

1139
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
it became hard to understand which

1140
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
schema language to use to describe all

1141
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,400
this and so we actually um

1142
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,880
did up our initial schemas in in json

1143
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,880
json schema

1144
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,280
um and i like it because it's

1145
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,280
sufficiently rich to accomplish the job

1146
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,280
and yet it's still readable unlike

1147
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
certain schema languages

1148
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,119
um so these are

1149
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,359
just some other things and we we do need

1150
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,800
multiple refs

1151
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,599
you know real refs to be able to call in

1152
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,160
various polymorphic like things

1153
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,440
and as i said

1154
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,359
in my initial attempts at least and i

1155
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:22,960
won't claim to be

1156
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,599
a swagger expert but in my initial

1157
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,599
attempts at this with swagger i i

1158
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,119
absolutely got frustrated and i did

1159
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,280
spend a fair amount of time trying to un

1160
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,319
to get through some of those

1161
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,520
frustrations in terms of having uh

1162
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,680
a fully normalized view

1163
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,599
so these are just some things that i

1164
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,119
raise for comment

1165
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,000
eliot you have eric on the cube

1166
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,319
okay

1167
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,000
uh eric norman so um

1168
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,920
from an information flow perspective

1169
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,839
it's clear that you know the the

1170
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,359
supplier is actually providing a bunch

1171
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,920
of information right

1172
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,720
credentials etc right s bombs whatever

1173
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,160
when i added that

1174
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,240
but but from the perspective of who is

1175
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,880
initiating the operation to add this

1176
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,480
thing to the system

1177
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,119
it's not clear that's the supplier

1178
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,880
because yeah you can

1179
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,040
do it yeah you might want to wait until

1180
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,280
the the light bulb showed up the pallet

1181
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,720
of light bulb showed up on the loading

1182
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,200
bar dock right until you do that right

1183
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,240
so it's not clear that this

1184
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,800
communication thing necessarily changes

1185
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,640
and if you think of it that way then you

1186
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,839
have

1187
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,599
as a sort of enterprise accepting this

1188
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,839
stuff you can now say okay i'm gonna put

1189
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,000
these things in these groups or whatever

1190
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,599
other structural things you have right

1191
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,280
similar to the way you handle

1192
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,040
users and putting them in groups or

1193
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,560
organizations or whatever so i don't

1194
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,200
think it's actually that different

1195
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,400
well i think

1196
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,640
i think you can see it both ways eric

1197
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,400
that and i think both models are

1198
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,119
perfectly reasonable to to

1199
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,680
to pursue

1200
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,680
you've got tim on the cube hey tim

1201
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,920
microsoft um i think the difference

1202
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,200
i think the one thing that's different

1203
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,800
in this world is that you essentially

1204
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,040
have a bootstrap idp and then the final

1205
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,280
idp so there's really two idps at play

1206
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,200
which doesn't traditionally exist on the

1207
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,319
user

1208
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,839
that that's because ultimately like dpp

1209
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,200
for example the supplier needs to

1210
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,400
essentially send you a list of public

1211
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,000
keys map them to something and then drop

1212
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,680
them in and then at that point you can

1213
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,880
provision a new credential that's

1214
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,040
specific to your organization so i think

1215
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,240
that's the difference in the flows as

1216
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,839
well

1217
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,000
yeah this doesn't talk about

1218
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,240
what happens once the enterprise

1219
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,319
receives the information

1220
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,640
there's mere presumption that the right

1221
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,640
thing happens but i don't get into any

1222
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,200
details in this discussion about what

1223
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,040
that is right as you said tim in dpp

1224
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,200
you're gonna there'll be a maybe a dpp

1225
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,240
2.0 exchange and then there'll be a

1226
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,960
certificate and one example would be a

1227
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,760
certificate uh provisioning for that

1228
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,319
individual device trust anchor exchange

1229
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,760
yada yada yada for 83.66 it might just

1230
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,960
be a a conversion from an idev id to

1231
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,040
ldap id communication

1232
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,680
um online however that might occur

1233
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,560
um

1234
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,359
you know

1235
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,319
etc and so all that mechanism

1236
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,560
i don't think we should have to go into

1237
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,960
great detail in the skim group all we

1238
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
should be able to do is support the

1239
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,200
transfer of the information

1240
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,200
so that it can get there

1241
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,919
enter domain

1242
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,440
questions comments because that's it i

1243
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,560
think next slide is there a next slide

1244
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,800
okay you just posed a question you've

1245
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,640
got tim on the queue i should have said

1246
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,079
by the way as someone who's been trying

1247
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,599
to battle this for seven years prior to

1248
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:40,960
joining microsoft i'm very supportive of

1249
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,680
this

1250
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,279
i think i hear a co-author

1251
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,280
okay so

1252
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,119
so elliot um

1253
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,440
your last question is a draft that's

1254
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,599
kind of open-ended

1255
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,359
well yeah because i don't really know

1256
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,880
exactly how we want to take this forward

1257
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,800
and i sort of leave i'm in your hands

1258
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,240
chairs

1259
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,560
yeah so at minimum it needs to be

1260
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,200
captured in the use cases

1261
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,760
just so that you know i i do believe

1262
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,640
it's in charter as we are saying we need

1263
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,119
to update the use cases all of this

1264
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,119
we obviously need to get consensus from

1265
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,640
the group right

1266
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,880
um so we did we did defer the

1267
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,119
the pull for the way forward

1268
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,440
for the use case draft

1269
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,319
and so one potential avenue is for you

1270
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,240
to incorporate

1271
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,079
these concepts into the use case content

1272
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,200
and i can make that addition to the poll

1273
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,040
um

1274
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,960
or you could create

1275
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,720
a proposal

1276
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,640
i think earlier on

1277
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,000
you i think leif asked a question on you

1278
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,720
know

1279
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,240
what's the main

1280
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,319
update change here

1281
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,680
um

1282
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,839
and i think the use case may clarify

1283
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,440
that um

1284
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,440
the second step or

1285
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,079
or similar step could be you generate a

1286
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,119
draft

1287
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,640
that shows that way forward and a

1288
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,079
proposal of what that might look like

1289
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,599
actually i'd really like to hear from

1290
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,400
pam as to as to how she'd like to

1291
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,839
proceed on this a little bit

1292
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,760
no you do not

1293
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,040
we recognize you pam

1294
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,920
um i so i think the question is

1295
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,079
if it is a draft i think are we looking

1296
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,400
at a schema extent like do we have to

1297
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,960
make that technical well leap first or

1298
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,240
do you just want to talk about the use

1299
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,440
cases there's two parts to it right it's

1300
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,160
the

1301
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,599
the solution what that may look like

1302
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,359
but then there's the recognition that

1303
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,520
this is a valid use case and that's

1304
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,359
where i'm suggesting

1305
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,440
you know we could create a separate use

1306
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,200
case draft but we said we would be

1307
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,480
updating it so for me it feels logical

1308
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,240
as you're working on the adoption that

1309
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,200
you could incorporate the content but

1310
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,760
that would be my preference

1311
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,280
yeah that makes sense to me i think too

1312
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,119
i mean there's at least three people who

1313
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,359
have knowledge and expertise here

1314
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,800
right so i think we have you know we

1315
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,559
have enough people to to

1316
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,480
flesh out something that that others

1317
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,800
could then riff on right

1318
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,520
so i'm in support

1319
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,880
so i could uh i could make one pole and

1320
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,480
if that doesn't go then i can break it

1321
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,480
up into multiple poles

1322
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,680
so how about if i do a pull of

1323
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,160
is the

1324
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,160
i'm gonna short

1325
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,359
short it into is the hack md content

1326
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,640
presented by pam

1327
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,960
by pam

1328
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,319
and

1329
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,240
elliot's

1330
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,440
iot use case

1331
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,920
sufficient

1332
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,520
oh you're getting back on the queue yeah

1333
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,119
i just realized something

1334
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,440
sorry

1335
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,640
just thought of a reason so one thing is

1336
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,040
we have to decide what the use cases and

1337
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,920
concepts document applies to so if if

1338
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,599
this kind of

1339
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,280
iot work

1340
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,800
is new work

1341
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,559
then it might actually be applicable to

1342
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,000
a new version like if we're going to

1343
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,079
write use cases and concepts for the

1344
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,839
existing rfcs 76 43 and 44

1345
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,040
then that might need to be a different

1346
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,480
work effort

1347
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,400
than than the new work that this would

1348
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,040
constitute

1349
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,359
i don't know does that i mean we we

1350
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,880
could wrap them together but i do feel

1351
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,920
like a description that is purely skim

1352
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,280
2.0

1353
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,000
is valuable but if others disagree

1354
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,079
so i don't know if we concluded as to

1355
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,400
the update because we discussed this i

1356
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,480
think in 112 and in the

1357
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,160
in the virtual

1358
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,480
but we didn't conclude as to whether

1359
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,000
the update

1360
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,920
would be to skim 2.0 or if we would just

1361
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,680
do a jump

1362
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,760
and the updates would really be creating

1363
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,680
a skim 3.0

1364
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,880
so we might want to do that scope

1365
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,359
question first i don't know

1366
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,598
okay

1367
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,720
okay

1368
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,800
we've got more people on the queue phil

1369
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,839
you're next and cue

1370
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,720
phil are you on mute

1371
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,079
it's not his audio is not working

1372
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,720
so phil's comment on the chat is uh

1373
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,480
on the jabber

1374
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,640
that elliot's draft is just a new schema

1375
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,200
but uh this is more on the revisioning

1376
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,960
of the draft so

1377
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,480
um

1378
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,400
phil can you speak

1379
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,400
okay while we're waiting for phil

1380
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,720
collin

1381
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,160
sure so i was just going to say

1382
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,520
my comment's really simple which it

1383
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,920
seems like these could be split apart as

1384
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,599
two different pieces of work of the the

1385
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,520
device's stuff and the the refreshing

1386
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,520
the the other thing so i i my only

1387
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,960
advice would be just everything that can

1388
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,880
be split apart split apart why not

1389
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,400
unless they have to be deeply coupled in

1390
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,520
some way

1391
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,440
and i'm in favor of course dealing with

1392
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,400
devices um i hate the word iot but i

1393
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,839
like the word devices

1394
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,520
um but it seems like it could be split

1395
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,599
apart so with that let me jump off

1396
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,760
yeah we can argue iot versus devices

1397
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,640
later

1398
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,319
it's the body of work

1399
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:53,200
but but cullen um sorry you might have

1400
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,920
to come back so are you speaking that it

1401
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,079
would be okay to incorporate into the

1402
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,480
use case draft and then we decide as to

1403
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,280
whether the solution gets split

1404
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,800
yeah sure i just think that documenting

1405
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,559
the actual protocol solution you may

1406
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,559
want you probably can split them up and

1407
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,480
have one be an extension to the devices

1408
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,040
being extension to the base and

1409
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,640
split that up and as far as use cases

1410
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,720
yeah put them all in one place thanks

1411
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,319
yup thanks

1412
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:22,240
okay phil should we give you another try

1413
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,920
no we lost them okay elliott while we're

1414
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,319
still waiting for phil

1415
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:33,200
yeah i i um

1416
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,359
i'm fine with with

1417
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,960
breaking up work where it can be broken

1418
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,240
up my only comment is simply that

1419
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,400
this is not just schema work

1420
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,319
um there's connection model there's data

1421
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,599
direction

1422
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,480
um we should i i was figuring we would

1423
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,319
just cross those bridges when we came to

1424
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:51,599
them

1425
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,000
you know flowing from the use cases

1426
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,280
that's all

1427
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
yeah and that's why i try to explain

1428
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,200
that first we need to recognize it as a

1429
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,720
use case in the group and then we

1430
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,319
determine

1431
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,160
the path forward and the actual

1432
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,720
technical work um

1433
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,240
danny you were on the queue and you

1434
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,000
disappeared

1435
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,640
i'm presuming

1436
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,400
you're back danny you had a comment

1437
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,000
it was uh pretty much just to say uh

1438
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,520
once you get into my section this is one

1439
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,400
of the key things that i want to cover

1440
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,280
which is essentially what's 2.0 what

1441
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,400
whatever the next is like 2.1 3.0 okay

1442
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,319
and uh specifically that use cases

1443
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:31,839
saying that pam step back up can you

1444
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,359
hear me now

1445
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,079
yes we can phil yeah

1446
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,799
okay thanks so danny

1447
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,880
i think you got your point

1448
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,079
thank you

1449
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,680
okay phil we can now hear you

1450
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,839
i'm worried because i have to talk later

1451
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,079
sorry yeah i was like i cannot do all

1452
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,559
the slides phil

1453
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,359
it is uh breaking up a lot so hopefully

1454
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,280
we'll have success i just wanted to say

1455
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,720
to elliot

1456
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,000
go ahead

1457
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,640
i think elliott's could be

1458
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,680
a new draft the big part of it is new

1459
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,920
schema and it also occurs to me that

1460
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,240
along with devices

1461
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,640
we need authentication authenticator

1462
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,880
schema

1463
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,760
as well so that might be two drafts and

1464
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,559
then the reverse flow might be

1465
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,400
accommodated with the security event

1466
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,880
tokens and we'll see more about that

1467
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,160
later

1468
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,040
okay so phil just to clarify you are

1469
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,640
speaking to the technical solution

1470
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,240
um

1471
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,839
the question that i want to put on the

1472
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,079
poll is whether

1473
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,799
we should incorporate the iot slash

1474
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,160
devices as a use case in the updated use

1475
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,480
case draft

1476
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,920
are you speaking in favor again

1477
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,799
can you say that again

1478
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,760
are you okay incorporating the iot use

1479
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,480
case

1480
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,480
in the base use case draft

1481
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,919
its use cases not technical solution

1482
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,078
hello

1483
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,559
can you hear me now

1484
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,839
i'll put in the chat

1485
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,480
i i just type

1486
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,359
he hasn't typed uh no no no private

1487
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,839
chats

1488
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:48,640
okay

1489
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,040
well he can vote against it

1490
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,040
let me just run the poll because

1491
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,559
we are

1492
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,880
well over time

1493
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,400
sorry i i

1494
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,240
yeah um

1495
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,400
so we are well over time so let me run

1496
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,839
the poll and then we need to move

1497
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,200
forward

1498
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,079
so

1499
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,280
um

1500
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,559
start the session come on

1501
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,559
my machine

1502
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,799
crank the bits come on

1503
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,440
can you see the code come on

1504
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,559
there we go

1505
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,359
okay

1506
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,720
so this question is since pam presented

1507
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,079
the outline that's in the hackmd

1508
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,440
for base content it's not final it just

1509
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,520
enumerates some but it gives us a

1510
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,599
starting point and then elliott also

1511
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,880
produced

1512
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,680
a use case that goes to iot slash

1513
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,359
devices

1514
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,000
can we incorporate both of them and can

1515
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,599
that serve as the base for pam and

1516
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:46,559
elliot

1517
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,160
to start the

1518
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,640
use case draft

1519
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,440
so raise your hand if you believe that

1520
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,319
to be the case

1521
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,640
or not

1522
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,240
okay it's not just my connection

1523
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,078
okay we're gonna give it uh

1524
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,200
ten more seconds

1525
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,078
and i'll close it

1526
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,520
while we wait for that can i just jump

1527
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,440
in with my okay

1528
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,240
so

1529
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,079
i mean you're still gonna

1530
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,720
do an uh i still have to do a call for

1531
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,680
adoption

1532
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,599
so yeah all right

1533
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,400
but pam wanted guidance and

1534
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,280
you know ellie presented the use case so

1535
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,799
okay so pam you have rough consensus

1536
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,599
julie you have good consensus 24.

1537
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:52,559
um

1538
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,680
so what you can do is we can give you a

1539
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,799
public

1540
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,119
that's not adopted yet in the skim

1541
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,640
working group and you can put stuff

1542
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,400
there and you and elliot can move

1543
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,720
forward okay with that we are running

1544
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,319
well over

1545
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:07,680
um

1546
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,400
danny and janelle

1547
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,359
protocol and schema

1548
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,079
did you want us to share the slides or

1549
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,640
did you want to use um present them

1550
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,760
yourselves

1551
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,720
uh could you please share them

1552
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,240
and it's one

1553
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,119

1554
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,359
yeah it was loaded

1555
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:37,440
give us a second we loaded them but

1556
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,200

1586
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,960
currently uh like nominated for tribute

1587
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,559
uh editors for uh schemas and protocols

1588
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:04,359
uh next slide please

1589
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,400
oh wait i'm presenting so

1590
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,000
uh i

1591
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
i have to do the next slide

1592
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
um

1593
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,400
bear with me um so

1594
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,240
yeah just uh

1595
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,880
a quick sort of run through things uh so

1596
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,319
the current charter that we have i

1597
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:23,760
provided a link

1598
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,880
um

1599
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,000
and

1600
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,119
one of the things that's been uh

1601
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,359
proposed and discussed uh especially i

1602
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,359
believe in itf-12 but also in the

1603
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,400
interim sessions that we've had in

1604
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,680
between

1605
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,559
is

1606
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:40,720
uh the topic of progressing uh skim 2.0

1607
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,640
standard from proposed standard which is

1608
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,079
where it sits today

1609
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,400
uh into uh internet standards sort of

1610
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,119
its final form uh and there's sort of a

1611
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,119
floating question of uh is there

1612
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,599
significant value there uh like do do we

1613
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,839
polish up scam 2.0 put a bow on it

1614
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,039
finalize it

1615
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,960
uh or do we just sort of leave it as

1616
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,720
proposed standard and

1617
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,480
uh work on

1618
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,039
2.1 or 3.0 or whatever we may call it i

1619
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,520
think i refer to it as v next in most of

1620
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,520
the remainder of the deck

1621
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,599
um and then there's another floating

1622
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:12,799
question of what level of error

1623
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,440
correction clarity enhancement etc is

1624
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,400
permissible

1625
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,319
without issuing a new version an rsc

1626
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,000
series it's uh sort of like what is it

1627
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,839
the ship maker's problem where if you

1628
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,839
replace um all the wood on a boat one

1629
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,280
board is high at what point does it stop

1630
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,760
being the same boat like how how much

1631
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,119
can we change it with actually still

1632
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,160
remaining 2.0 and to that i strongly

1633
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,160
look towards the chairs for guidance

1634
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,319
uh but i want to just just you know put

1635
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:37,599
that out there it is one of the big

1636
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,280
problems that we're trying to wrap our

1637
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,160
heads around today of how much of the

1638
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,520
charter that we have today

1639
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,359
um

1640
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:48,880
yeah how much how much of it is a

1641
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,079
charter today

1642
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,400
sorry um thoughts are getting doubled uh

1643
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,559
how much of it is doable today versus in

1644
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,160
uh in a future

1645
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,680
version um and then uh so the try to

1646
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,039
propose a lot of schema and protocol

1647
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:03,119
enhancements virtually all of those are

1648
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,559
too big to be

1649
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,720
um part of 2.0 uh if you know we're

1650
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,839
looking at that as error correction and

1651
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,680
whatnot so

1652
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,520
there's um that a question that i would

1653
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,799
like to be

1654
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,039
uh discussed which is

1655
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,720
uh do do we go towards 2.1 3.0 or do we

1656
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,720
finalize 2.0 and just

1657
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,240
throw out a litany of extensions to

1658
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,200
cover the you know 20 plus topics

1659
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,599
that the charter would like us to cover

1660
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,400
so i'm gonna move to the next slide

1661
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,880
and uh just quickly here's all of the

1662
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,119
work related to schemas and protocols

1663
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,000
that's uh listed in the charter

1664
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,599
it's available at that link that i've

1665
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,039
also previously shared i'm not going to

1666
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,280
spend too much time on this but it's

1667
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,400
everything

1668
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,960
from uh you know sort of clarifying and

1669
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,480
expanding on usage of things like

1670
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,760
external id

1671
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,640
uh changes and expansion to account

1672
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,119
state um you know completely new

1673
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,559
concepts like multi-value query

1674
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,319
filtering and paging

1675
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,559
uh and you know a couple of other things

1676
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,319
as well and

1677
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:03,119
uh

1678
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,520
it's just there is no conceivable way

1679
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,119
that we do this inside of 2.0 so i

1680
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,119
really want to get like a a group

1681
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,799
consensus

1682
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:11,760
uh

1683
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,760
and figure out how we proceed forward

1684
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,559
uh and one quick thing to share also we

1685
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,480
have uh set up uh with the chairs help a

1686
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,280
uh

1687
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,599
a github uh organization and we have a

1688
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,920
couple of repos containing uh the

1689
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,079
current xml versions of

1690
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,680
the uh the schema and the protocol apis

1691
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,480
and we're going to be working on uh sort

1692
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,480
of tracking the various issues as github

1693
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,280
issues uh to easily facilitate uh

1694
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,960
certain discussion and propose solutions

1695
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,880
throughout that uh which we we will

1696
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,119
still also then recap uh and bring

1697
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,200
things for discussion uh

1698
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,000
over the skim mailing list as well

1699
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,559
um and there's just a couple notes on uh

1700
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,200
the plan of how we proceed here uh i'm

1701
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,440
not gonna linger on this unless anybody

1702
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,640
has questions i'll send this out via

1703
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,839
email as well

1704
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,480
so uh

1705
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,480
i guess one of the the big topics and

1706
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,520
i'm trying to get through this quickly

1707
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,880
because this is a

1708
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,960
discussion really i like the goal here

1709
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,400
is feedback

1710
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,160
um

1711
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,640
one of the things that um if we were to

1712
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,160
push 2.0 to be internet standard we

1713
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,160
would need to do a survey on the

1714
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,960
implementation of concepts and

1715
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,280
uh honestly even if we're not pushing it

1716
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,280
for 2.0 there's probably still value in

1717
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,839
figuring out are there parts in the

1718
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:34,960
survey are scott uh sorry uh are there

1719
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,640
parts in

1720
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:37,760
the

1721
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,720
uh in the 2.0 standard in the schema or

1722
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,760
protocol that just aren't adopted you

1723
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,920
know either at all or widely or in an

1724
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,440
interoperable manner

1725
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,760
uh and so we'd like to get feedback on

1726
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,000
that and sort of start the ball rolling

1727
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,599
on uh

1728
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:54,400
either

1729
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,000
cutting or

1730
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,960
uh resolving issues with certain parts

1731
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:04,160
of the uh of the existing standards

1732
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,440
uh i'm sorry let me go back a second uh

1733
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,960
and so yeah just a couple of examples

1734
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,880
there um you know basic auth in the

1735
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,680
uh in 2.0 you know skim was you know

1736
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,480
skin people was published in 2015

1737
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,440
um

1738
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,880
at this point in time just you know i i

1739
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,640
think it's sort of inexcusable to use

1740
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,480
basic auth unlike the you know an

1741
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,559
internet facing implementation of scam

1742
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,960
versus something like a bearer token or

1743
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,720
some form of oauth

1744
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,280
uh there's also uh you know passwords um

1745
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,160
if the

1746
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:38,960
the

1747
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,559
common law of the land nowadays and you

1748
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,359
know industry standard is uh federation

1749
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,760
uh between uh you know in idp and

1750
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,880
something else is their value in

1751
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,720
uh the core schema at least containing

1752
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,280
passwords uh i i'm aware that there are

1753
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,079
certain uh mostly we'll call them like

1754
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:57,119
legacy

1755
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,079
uh

1756
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,760
concepts where um you know you might be

1757
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,000
provisioning into some you know like a

1758
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,760
mainframe or something where you must

1759
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,359
provide a password

1760
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,680
uh and that makes sense but whether or

1761
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,119
not those are sort of internet facing

1762
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,559
and whether they

1763
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,240
line up with the

1764
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,119
uh

1765
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,440
sort of the the goal of

1766
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,799
this game standard is um uh up in the

1767
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:20,158
air if we look at the name it's the

1768
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:24,000
system for cross domain identity uh

1769
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
uh management god i'm

1770
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,960
yeah i'm not uh my game today sorry

1771
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,158
uh

1772
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:32,158
and uh there's other things like photos

1773
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:33,679
as well um which we've discussed in the

1774
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,880
interim which from a sort of cross cloud

1775
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,120
standpoint um

1776
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,359
are hard if not impossible to implement

1777
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,839
due to security for concerns

1778
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:44,719
um

1779
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,560
so just you know

1780
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,359
very it's a non uh

1781
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,880
it's not an entire list the goal i again

1782
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,319
you know we want other people to get

1783
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,238
involved rather than just being uh

1784
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,600
janelle and i

1785
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,319
uh trying to figure things out on uh on

1786
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,279
the feminism protocols

1787
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:06,158
uh is anybody seeing this slide

1788
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,000
correctly it looks incredibly i just

1789
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,960
solution

1790
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,640
it looks

1791
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,560
looks uh bad

1792
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,158
i don't know what happened there

1793
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:17,839
yeah um

1794
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:19,600
okay well i happen to have this light up

1795
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,920
on my other monitor so

1796
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,799
it's a very short slide

1797
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:28,479
um so the title of it is xy problem

1798
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:31,279
um and uh i have a bullet that says are

1799
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,198
some concepts useful but potentially

1800
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:34,640
outside the scope of what the skim

1801
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,640
standard aims to address

1802
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,719
uh with a sub bullet that says some

1803
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,799
decisions on cuts and edits to 2.0

1804
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,479
should wait until after use cases are

1805
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:43,759
revised

1806
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,080
and then there's a question that sort of

1807
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,238
came up when uh when pam and elliot were

1808
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,719
speaking as well uh which is is the work

1809
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,600
to revise use cases targeted at 2.0

1810
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,480
uh

1811
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,360
at the v next of you know 2.1 3.0

1812
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,199
whichever or both

1813
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,320
which i i thinks are good now i was

1814
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,360
going to say

1815
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,679
uh phil has been on the queue he just

1816
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,640
dropped from the queue

1817
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,480
i didn't know if he had a comment on

1818
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,120
your slide

1819
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,640
phil feeler

1820
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,360
oh no comment okay never mind

1821
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,599
sorry

1822
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,080
um

1823
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,320
yeah and so finally just bringing it to

1824
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,640
a recap i really just landed it to the

1825
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,560
question or the questions that are

1826
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,800
floating and at this point i

1827
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,199
anybody who's here i i want uh opinions

1828
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,440
because i i've got my own but this you

1829
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,760
know the skin standard is not

1830
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,480
mine and i don't like i want

1831
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,159
feedback please

1832
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,800
on what my people's thoughts are on

1833
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,000
uh really each of these big points

1834
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,520
we actually had allocated 40 minutes

1835
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,360
so that we could have a discussion so

1836
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,159
any feedback for the protocols or the

1837
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:07,679
schema

1838
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,640
or the combination of both

1839
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,560
paul i think you're in the queue

1840
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,199
go ahead paul

1841
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:22,960
i am in the queue good morning

1842
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,800
um so my perspective on this is that we

1843
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,719
should do the right thing so as

1844
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,560
implementers i think looking at a long

1845
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,159
series of extensions can get really

1846
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,159
complicated and so the more we

1847
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,920
incorporate into the course back i think

1848
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,679
the better likely the better the

1849
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,520
likelihood is that we'll have

1850
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,679
full compliance with the

1851
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:41,280
the intended outcome of this working

1852
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,159
group

1853
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:45,360
in future implementations

1854
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,480
okay thank you

1855
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,920
janelle

1856
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,679
janel you're you're a presenter so you

1857
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:52,880
don't have to get in the queue by the

1858
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,480
way

1859
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,840
i know i just

1860
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,760
didn't want to interrupt anybody

1861
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,000
um one of the things when we've been

1862
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,840
exploring things is we look at the core

1863
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,760
schema and there is a lot in the core

1864
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,159
schema comprising an identity and

1865
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:07,520
there's a lot of questions that come

1866
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,560
into play

1867
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,960
regarding that like for instance it may

1868
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,199
be valid to keep passwords around for

1869
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,920
some use cases but perhaps driving that

1870
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,960
into its own extension or sub-schema

1871
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,440
of the core and and same goes for some

1872
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,640
of the other

1873
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,480
schema elements but if we start breaking

1874
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,159
apart like that and take them out of the

1875
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:27,520
core

1876
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,520
then you know what does that mean for

1877
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,440
those who've implemented 2.0 that sounds

1878
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,480
like more like a 3.0 thing

1879
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,440
um

1880
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,040
which is kind of where some of the

1881
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,520
thoughts that we've had have gone when

1882
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,960
we've been discussing like how do we

1883
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,800
just put a bow on 2.0 like should we

1884
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,679
just do light edits say this is it and

1885
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,000
and give 2.0 the credibility has lots of

1886
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,480
people have implemented it as it is

1887
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,199
um with some clarifications um fixing

1888
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,120
the errata

1889
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,760
some really clear use cases of of how to

1890
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,800
work with the spec as it is or

1891
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,640
just say that's it this was a great

1892
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,640
standard it served its purpose for its

1893
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,600
time

1894
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,239
like let's drive forward on 3.0 i think

1895
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,719
that's that's where we wind up half the

1896
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,719
time that's where danny and i are coming

1897
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,440
from is just how light do we want to be

1898
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,280
or

1899
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,560
you know how quickly do we start

1900
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,800
coloring outside of the 2.0 lines before

1901
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,840
it's not too low anymore

1902
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,679
i mean doing the survey and and

1903
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,440
eventually once you get a draft out

1904
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,679
there with reviewers

1905
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:32,400
i'm sure you'll get feedback

1906
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,400
just as the tls working group did

1907
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,239
although they also took a survey before

1908
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,919
they deprecated 1.0

1909
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,360
phil you're in the queue

1910
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,960
phil's having audio issues i can relay

1911
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,360
his comment he says

1912
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,120
questions regarding photos photos is

1913
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,960
just a uri

1914
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,760
there is no obligation to import or pass

1915
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,760
an image into skim

1916
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,640
is that the issue

1917
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,520
uh

1918
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,239
so

1919
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,320
yeah photos came up in one of our uh or

1920
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,679
i think this is our most recent uh

1921
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,239
interim session as well and i never got

1922
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:09,679
a chance to follow up on it over the

1923
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,280
working group email

1924
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,960
uh so

1925
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,040
the the problem with photos from uh sort

1926
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,840
of like a sas or like a cloud internet

1927
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,040
scenario

1928
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,080
is

1929
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,000
uh

1930
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,640
you if photos in the spec right now is

1931
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,480
described as a url and at that point uh

1932
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,920
you're communicating the url and the

1933
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,480
other side would just uh so

1934
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,239
you know the client communicates the url

1935
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,159
and the server would then have the url

1936
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,400
on hand to go pull the picture from

1937
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,679
uh

1938
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:41,199
there's

1939
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,960
problems there though of how does the

1940
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,120
client especially when it's over

1941
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,920
the internet rather than on an intranet

1942
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,000
uh where there's you know firewall rules

1943
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,360
and you know just security is a little

1944
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,880
more easily managed

1945
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,719
uh how does the

1946
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,440
the server come back and retrieve that

1947
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,320
image

1948
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,199
uh

1949
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,360
to use and it's it's in its own service

1950
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,719
uh sort of like hot linking to it and

1951
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,159
just pulling the image every time it

1952
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,440
needs to be loaded

1953
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,080
isn't necessarily feasible and just uh

1954
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,880
from being my own experiences which

1955
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,120
color my you know my thoughts here

1956
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,400
um

1957
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,960
any like fast implementers that i've

1958
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,560
talked to who have service providers who

1959
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,159
want to consume pictures

1960
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,440
they want to be able to receive a

1961
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,520
picture and store it in their service so

1962
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,520
that there's no meaningful latency when

1963
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,840
they go to show it in somebody's profile

1964
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,360
and so that whole

1965
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,120
like approach to pictures

1966
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,679
uh isn't something that's really uh

1967
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,199
doable today with what's described in

1968
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:38,678
the skim spec

1969
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,719
sort of a question sort of a comment so

1970
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,040
um with respect to that question now how

1971
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,239
to deal with making this skim 2.1 making

1972
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:59,040
it skim 3.0 something like that

1973
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,600
my observation is somebody digging into

1974
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,239
skim very recently and discovering skim

1975
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:05,600
very recently

1976
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,280
is that there is quite some wide

1977
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,000
adoption actually in a quite specific

1978
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,600
use cases like identity providers

1979
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,159
provisioning star services and this is

1980
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,360
actually very widespread so a lot of

1981
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,760
services are supporting that so i wonder

1982
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,840
if there would be some major breaks or

1983
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,239
major changes that it

1984
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,000
probably would be very difficult to to

1985
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,800
change all these implementations

1986
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,880
and so far it was very difficult for me

1987
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,320
to identify other users or use cases so

1988
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,400
far so i'm a little bit surprised or

1989
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,000
it's new to me to see there's so much

1990
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,840
interest in iot

1991
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,600
at least i didn't easily stumble upon

1992
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,040
that while

1993
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,679
introducing my or myself to to

1994
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:48,080
skim before so my question a little bit

1995
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,760
is also is there some

1996
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,080
um i mean which i think would be helpful

1997
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,920
for casting that decision about how to

1998
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,440
go forward with a

1999
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,120
uh with the update of the standards is

2000
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,120
basically does anybody actually have an

2001
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,960
overview of which different domains

2002
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,679
exist and use cases

2003
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:06,480
are already implemented and if not that

2004
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,040
might be i think very helpful in order

2005
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,040
to cast that decision

2006
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,199
yeah pam i want to say in the buff we

2007
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:14,560
had

2008
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,320
we had a cursory it wasn't complete um

2009
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,400
[Music]

2010
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,239
so we could try and bring that up in an

2011
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:20,920
introduction

2012
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,320
[Music]

2013
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,360
perhaps in a virtual interim

2014
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,360
yeah to help with that

2015
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,759
go ahead pam

2016
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,320
yeah i think there's some interesting

2017
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,080
question about um

2018
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,679
so the use cases that we did see that

2019
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,920
were new often they were

2020
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,640
characterized as schema extensions um

2021
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,719
and they included hr

2022
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:47,679
um

2023
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:50,560
hr use cases um we can definitely go

2024
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,840
back and look at

2025
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,120
what those are but i think we have a

2026
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,280
starting point for that kind of

2027
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,800
um

2028
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,560
overview if you will that there were two

2029
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,120
main categories there was the updating

2030
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,480
of the protocols for scaling scalability

2031
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,880
and then from a schema it was i think we

2032
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,600
used the word modernizing

2033
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,640
um

2034
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,760
relating to the the fields that an hr

2035
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,000
database might have

2036
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,239
but as pam said we can you know we can

2037
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,120
bring those back um they may actually be

2038
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,840
noted also oh no it wasn't about never

2039
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,960
mind

2040
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,800
but we can bring those back up

2041
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,600
your point is well taken thanks

2042
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,960
um

2043
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,520
so danny i i should channel

2044
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,480
philip's response to your response to

2045
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,199
the uri and photos

2046
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:40,800
is um

2047
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,280
there was discussion before but maybe it

2048
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,600
was on a virtual um

2049
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,600
but anyway there was consensus from

2050
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,440
before

2051
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,480
uh that implementers wanted to choose

2052
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,679
how to solve the problem

2053
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,239
as opposed to addressing

2054
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:01,679
so that was phil's feedback

2055
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,600
um

2056
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,440
yeah i

2057
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,440
uh

2058
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,320
from my own experience uh

2059
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,280
there's

2060
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,280
a lack of adoption for specifically

2061
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,719
photos because

2062
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,280
there is no standardized way to approach

2063
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,880
it so it's really i think a question of

2064
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,719
uh is the

2065
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,280
current uh photos uh just you know

2066
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,560
sticking with this um

2067
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,800
fleshed out enough to actually be

2068
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,840
adopted

2069
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,880
at all

2070
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,080
and i suspect that the answer is yes

2071
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,159
based off of what phil said in the

2072
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,000
previous interim

2073
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,920
uh however

2074
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,239
uh this in turn i think brings us to the

2075
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,679
third bullet point on the slide that i'm

2076
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:49,920
showing right now which is uh even

2077
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,360
though it's not really milestone related

2078
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,280
but um for things related to the scheme

2079
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,640
and protocol

2080
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,600
um

2081
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,719
should we

2082
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,120
like try and get the use cases to cover

2083
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,600
things like to uh to cover

2084
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,520
uh essentially to describe the problem

2085
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,920
that we're going to solve because well

2086
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,440
the the

2087
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,000
uh description of how to do photos in

2088
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,520
skim today

2089
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,199
works in certain scenarios but it

2090
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,400
doesn't really work in like the the

2091
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,199
internet the sassy scenario

2092
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,440
uh which is

2093
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,719
uh yeah i don't know why there's an echo

2094
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,960
um

2095
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,639
but uh

2096
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:27,920
so yeah

2097
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,000
the photos work somewhere but does it

2098
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,600
work for

2099
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,000
what skim is actually trying to solve

2100
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,280
i guess that's the question and this

2101
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,120
then expands out to a whole bunch of

2102
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,159
other things like passwords

2103
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,719
yeah so absolutely for some of the new

2104
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,719
work you'll you'll be guided through the

2105
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,600
use cases i thought in the charter we

2106
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,080
had some examples of the updates that

2107
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:53,920
needed to happen vis-a-vis the schema

2108
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,280
i'd have to go back and look at the

2109
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,239
charter

2110
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:59,520
so danny you you put this the schema and

2111
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,440
the schema and the protocol

2112
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,679
is going to be gated somewhat by the use

2113
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:06,000
cases but i felt that there was enough

2114
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,159
of an understanding that

2115
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,080
some of the work not all could be done

2116
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,440
in parallel

2117
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,560
if that's not correct then

2118
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,480
i stand corrected

2119
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,239
i i think some of it can be done in

2120
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:21,760
parallel um we if i still need to

2121
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,400
lan like figure out and do a vote or

2122
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,080
whichever on

2123
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,719
how we proceed whether it's the 2.0 or a

2124
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,239
v next just so that we can have

2125
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:32,080
consensus so i'd like to

2126
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,360
i just figure out how we were that and

2127
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,280
put it up to a vote here

2128
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,760
or a show of hands

2129
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,760
on uh do we finalize 2.0 and

2130
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,320
build out a series of extensions

2131
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,199
or do we work straight uh like do we

2132
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:50,080
just move towards 3.0 or you know use

2133
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,600
3.0 as a placeholder when i'm speaking

2134
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,880
sorry

2135
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,480
for whatever the next version number may

2136
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,280
be

2137
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,280
lasers in the queue

2138
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,880
so i think the current version the

2139
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,760
current published specs are 2.0 that's

2140
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,960
how

2141
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,440
they've been described um

2142
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,719
for a long time right so i think

2143
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,280
whatever this is is 2.1 or

2144
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,120
3.0

2145
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,719
um

2146
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:15,920
and i would

2147
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,679
i tried to

2148
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:19,679
i split it up into

2149
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,520
individual github issues and have a

2150
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,360
discussion i mean maybe starting with

2151
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,400
the

2152
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,320
you know any identified fundamental

2153
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,840
stuff

2154
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,120
um

2155
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,280
that actually changes the protocol

2156
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,199
you know in a way that breaks

2157
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,960
maybe breaks backwards compatibility

2158
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,480
compatibility but it's certainly sort of

2159
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,400
there are stuff here that

2160
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,880
maybe is challenges underlying

2161
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,199
assumptions from from the point of view

2162
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:44,960
client implementers and that should

2163
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,040
probably go first

2164
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,800
in the discussion queue to figure out

2165
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,840
sort of you know what their what the

2166
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,719
implementation

2167
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,520
community is thinking about it

2168
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,800
um

2169
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,280
that's i guess what i would do and

2170
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,360
and then you know yeah there are plenty

2171
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,440
of extensibility hooks in scheme there

2172
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,199
there's no need to push everything into

2173
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:06,800
the core brother goal if you don't have

2174
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,960
to

2175
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,560
thank you

2176
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,600
elliot you're in the queue

2177
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,199
thank you

2178
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,400
i largely

2179
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,679
agree with lei over what he just said um

2180
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:23,440
that that having like an issue tracker

2181
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,120
will will help

2182
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,800
um

2183
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,880
you know the

2184
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,040
i think the more important thing to get

2185
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,040
to is understand what good looks like

2186
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,520
rather than what the version number is

2187
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,880
and

2188
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,719
as much as you can increment i think

2189
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:41,120
it's good to increment

2190
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,880
the question is where do we need major

2191
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,120
change and what is incremental

2192
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,560
and

2193
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,120
those can even proceed in parallel in

2194
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,400
some sense

2195
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,960
if if that's what people want

2196
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,920
what

2197
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,199
um

2198
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:58,080
where i i slightly disagree and only

2199
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,360
only

2200
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,000
slightly disagree with life and it's

2201
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,360
such a small

2202
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,800
matter that i probably shouldn't even

2203
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,000
mention it but

2204
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,159
i i think it's important to understand

2205
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:10,480
core protocol implications what needs to

2206
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,600
be there

2207
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,480
what

2208
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,080
in the core what

2209
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,679
what needs to be

2210
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:17,120
in the um

2211
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,880
in extensions

2212
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,120
i'm not sure that that that skin is

2213
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,600
perfectly extensible i think a little

2214
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,840
bit of elaboration in whatever follow-on

2215
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,560
specifications happen should be a lot

2216
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,480
clearer about um for instance uh how do

2217
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,199
you fully normalize right because there

2218
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,040
there isn't a lot of example in that in

2219
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,960
skin

2220
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,040
and it's something that wasn't really

2221
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,840
con i mean i think it was contemplated

2222
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:46,239
but at the time that skim first came out

2223
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:47,199
right

2224
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:49,120
it needed to get done because people

2225
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,040
were waiting for it so now we have a

2226
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,360
little time it's worth at least making

2227
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,639
sure that you know things like

2228
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:57,199
normalization schema language choice

2229
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:58,639
all these things

2230
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:00,800
need a little bit of discussion thank

2231
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,800
you

2232
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,440
um

2233
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,480
janelle you pass on me to say

2234
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,880
yeah well thank you for your feedback

2235
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:21,920
everybody

2236
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,400
um who's provided it and

2237
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,120
i think yeah we're just you know trying

2238
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,679
to do what's right for the standard um

2239
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,920
the standard as it exists and as moving

2240
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,920
forward there's certainly areas that are

2241
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,360
interesting too

2242
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,719
um and it comes up with regards to

2243
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,120
the identity providers you know i think

2244
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,320
prior

2245
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,239
when skim.2.0

2246
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,280
was

2247
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,800
coming about as a standard there's this

2248
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,960
notion of the single authoritative

2249
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,199
source of identity data

2250
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:54,560
pushing that data

2251
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,400
the service providers can actually

2252
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,920
choose experiments

2253
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,800
that of course you must provide to them

2254
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,080
and um in part of our discussions was

2255
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:04,960
well

2256
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,920
should we

2257
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,719
have the service providers report back

2258
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:10,080
which

2259
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,440
attributes they're willing to accept

2260
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,638
from a from a client

2261
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,480
so that because they may not take them

2262
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,719
all they might not take the password for

2263
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,199
example or they also may not take any of

2264
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:22,480
the other attributes

2265
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,080
if they're you know if they feel that

2266
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,360
they're the authority of the phone

2267
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,239
number

2268
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,560
um and not the client they might say

2269
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,600
well we're going to ignore that phone

2270
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,800
number

2271
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,719
and so then this provides

2272
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:34,639
a notion of well then if you send that

2273
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,159
back and the client is expecting to then

2274
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:38,800
read back that data and match it with

2275
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,239
the data they have and there's a

2276
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:42,239
mismatch and how would you reconcile

2277
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,040
that

2278
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,080
um

2279
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,679
or how would the client reconcile that

2280
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:46,639
or

2281
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:48,000
do you move to more of a notion of a

2282
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,560
composed identity profile

2283
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,560
which might have data from multiple

2284
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,719
sources comprising the true

2285
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:55,840
identity

2286
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,000
of that

2287
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,080
individual

2288
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,080
was some of the other things that have

2289
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,000
come up and it comes up to when we talk

2290
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,159
about you know who's the authority on

2291
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,600
the device side

2292
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,080
uh for that device data and things like

2293
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,679
that as well so there's some there is

2294
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,840
definitely some overlap in that area

2295
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,040
um and i think it'd be great to

2296
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,080
get

2297
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,199
feedback on those thoughts

2298
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,520
given the guidance danny and janelle

2299
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,199
you could put

2300
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:31,360
you could put a first rough draft

2301
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,040
together

2302
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,159
and

2303
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:36,719
give that as a start because

2304
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:38,639
we still have to do a call for adoption

2305
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:40,480
for it anyway and i think you'll get

2306
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,880
more interest that way

2307
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,800
given that you have more substance there

2308
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,679
for people to discuss and say well

2309
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,440
this may be missing or we're not

2310
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,280
addressing this part or we don't believe

2311
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,800
this part should be addressed

2312
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,400
and the question is do you have enough

2313
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,280
now

2314
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,840
to get you

2315
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,400
going and then at the next virtual or or

2316
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,080
at the next

2317
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,679
face to face or hybrid

2318
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,560
you can do it that way

2319
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,920
okay

2320
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,920
yep

2321
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,400
okay uh well yeah we're at the end of

2322
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,639
the slides

2323
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,880
uh so i think at this point we'll

2324
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,560
uh sort of try and cut apart what can be

2325
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,320
accomplished uh

2326
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,159
without waiting for use cases what we

2327
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:30,400
think should reasonably we waited uh for

2328
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,320
to make sure that it aligns with these

2329
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,320
cases like is it a solution to a problem

2330
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,080
that you actually want to solve

2331
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,360
um

2332
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:38,639
and then

2333
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:39,520
uh

2334
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,480
we'll we'll work forward from there

2335
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,960
all righty

2336
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,440
well thank you

2337
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,760
thank you

2338
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,239
okay so we keep bringing the mic back

2339
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,199
and forth just for you guys to know

2340
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:58,960
we're trying to do our best is there may

2341
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,719
be some feedback but

2342
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:02,400
if i don't get it close

2343
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:06,879
then some in the remote can't hear me

2344
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,239
um

2345
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:11,760
so next up is phil

2346
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,000
and he was going to present skim events

2347
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,800
there is a draft up

2348
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,679
but he's having audio issues he did send

2349
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:22,400
me a transcript

2350
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,639
but my last question is phil do you want

2351
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:26,719
to give it one last try or do you want

2352
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,480
me to just read the transcript

2353
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,840
what's that

2354
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:45,360
okay he told me to go ahead and read it

2355
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:50,199
so you guys bear with me stay awake

2356
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:55,520
okay if you could share the slides

2357
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,199
great

2358
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:59,679
okay so

2359
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,600
thanks everyone for coming out today

2360
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,440
this presentation is about security

2361
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,639
events profile that i recently published

2362
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,960
as an individual draft

2363
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,040
what are security events and what are

2364
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,400
the propos

2365
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,880
what are we proposing for skim

2366
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,360
you may be wondering what a profile is i

2367
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,520
use that word to indicate we are not

2368
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,400
space specifying something new

2369
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,800
we're simply taking an existing set of

2370
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,199
specs and profiling them

2371
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:29,600
for use within skin

2372
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,760
so what are the security events then

2373
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,639
next slide

2374
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:36,880
oh that was the agenda slide

2375
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,800
next slide sorry

2376
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,080
okay

2377
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,840
what is a security event token

2378
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,679
it is a specialized use of jots profiled

2379
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:50,159
or exchanging secure event messages

2380
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,000
between systems

2381
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,199
in 2015 several groups inside and

2382
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,440
outside of the itf were all planning to

2383
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,360
do the same thing

2384
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,679
morteza and serie of cisco and then

2385
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,600
co-chair of skim

2386
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,159
william dennis of google and myself not

2387
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:08,400
me phil hunt

2388
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,480
then of oracle put together a draft

2389
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,960
specification in the skim working group

2390
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,480
that extended jots for skim events this

2391
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,719
draft was submitted to address skim's

2392
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:21,199
charter item of being able to send

2393
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:24,080
trigger events between systems

2394
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,679
because so many groups were thinking

2395
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,840
about the same thing there was quick

2396
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,719
agreement for oauth 2 open id connect

2397
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,880
and risk incident

2398
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,440
sharing groups i forgot to reset this

2399
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,719
risk

2400
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:38,800
incident sharing groups to work together

2401
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,840
on a common spec which later became

2402
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:42,719
set

2403
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:46,719
or in the itf rc 8417

2404
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:49,600
under the working group sec events

2405
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,960
so why use dots for a couple reasons

2406
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,120
we wanted a json message format that

2407
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,760
could be signed and or encrypted

2408
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,760
we wanted a form that could be secured

2409
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,440
independently of the medium for transfer

2410
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,679
so what is the security event and what

2411
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:07,440
makes it different from the skin

2412
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,800
protocol

2413
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:13,280
one way to think about this is that skin

2414
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:17,280
describes a set of synchronous http

2415
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,960
requests

2416
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,840
along with a message format that work as

2417
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,520
api

2418
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,760
and quotes commands

2419
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,400
however events are simply signed

2420
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,600
statements delivered asynchronously

2421
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,920
enabling a receiver to take some

2422
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,840
independent action

2423
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,480
in skim protocol control lies with the

2424
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,800
requester though the server is free to

2425
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,920
refuse

2426
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,440
while in set

2427
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,760
control lies with the receiver

2428
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,679
why is this important

2429
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:50,480
well in cross-domain scenarios the users

2430
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,800
and group entities represented may not

2431
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,639
be the same population

2432
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,639
and when they are they may not contain

2433
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:58,880
the same attributes

2434
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,360
what often does require coordination is

2435
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,000
a need to link life cycles of resources

2436
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,239
across domains for example

2437
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:09,280
a user disabled in domain a needs to

2438
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,719
ultimately be disabled in domain b

2439
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:15,199
in an event system the event receiver

2440
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:17,120
which has full knowledge of its local

2441
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,159
domain

2442
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,639
is able to take an external event

2443
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,120
request more information if needed and

2444
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,199
then reconcile that event to determine

2445
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,080
what local action should be taken if any

2446
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,639
next slide

2447
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:31,840
okay

2448
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,719
so

2449
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:35,280
the security event token spec

2450
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,600
rc 8417

2451
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,000
is the primary specification for skim

2452
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,199
events

2453
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,960
for those who want to implement set

2454
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,679
tokens you can create sets

2455
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:48,639
using almost any jot library

2456
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,560
i hope to have a new library shortly

2457
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,040
with some convenient builders for java

2458
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,639
shortly

2459
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:56,719
under the sec events working group two

2460
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:59,520
basic delivery specs were defined

2461
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,840
the set push delivery rc

2462
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:06,480
8935 specification allows a publisher to

2463
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,000
post an event

2464
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,400
to a registered web callback endpoint

2465
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:11,520
and

2466
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,920
the set pulling delivery spec rfc 8936

2467
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,880
allows a receiver to initiate http

2468
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,080
requests to retrieve new events

2469
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,480
to enable real-time delivery set polling

2470
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:28,320
also defines use of http long polling

2471
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,320
one aspect of these drafts is they do

2472
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,400
not require the set event publishers to

2473
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,560
guarantee long-term ability to recover

2474
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,760
events

2475
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,159
instead the specifications require the

2476
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:40,639
receiver acknowledge each event received

2477
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:42,480
after the receiver has securely

2478
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:46,320
validated and secured a received event

2479
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,080
when an event is acknowledged the

2480
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,719
publisher is free to forget

2481
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:53,440
every recovery is left to the receiver

2482
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,199
receivers

2483
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,040
why the heck did we do this well i

2484
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,119
believe it was because some set use

2485
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:00,560
cases

2486
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:04,880
like oidc risk open id risk

2487
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,880
called for some publishers to have

2488
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,080
hundreds

2489
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:11,280
of thousands of event receivers

2490
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,960
there were critical concerns that the

2491
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,520
ability for a publisher to retain past

2492
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,560
events

2493
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,119
for each specific receiver that recovery

2494
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:22,239
may not be possible is each event

2495
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:23,600
would take

2496
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,719
hundreds

2497
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,840
of thousands 100k copies

2498
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,000
persisted for a long period

2499
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,840
and if you have a few thousand ops per

2500
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,400
minute that can be a lot of data in

2501
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,480
these cases it's far easier for the

2502
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,760
receiver

2503
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,840
to accept and maintain the event to its

2504
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,199
own needs

2505
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,360
i note that in skim scenarios we likely

2506
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,199
won't have an out of balance cross

2507
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:46,800
domain relationships with event

2508
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,159
receivers

2509
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,400
i would anticipate relationships to be

2510
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,280
one to a few or more likely one-to-one

2511
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,880
exchanges of information between domains

2512
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,199
fortunately the set delivery specs do

2513
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,520
allow for longer event recoveries they

2514
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,440
just don't mandate it

2515
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,199
all this brings me to the issue of how

2516
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:08,000
can we implement this is there something

2517
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,320
that manages event feeds and implements

2518
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,400
the set transfer methods

2519
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,000
for that i want to turn to the

2520
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,360
presentation oh crap

2521
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,119
he's turning the presentation over to

2522
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:20,719
nancy that's me

2523
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:22,000
um

2524
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,239
as i can share some of the work that

2525
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,639
we're doing um

2526
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,840
with the cisco duo team um and it is

2527
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,280
open source so

2528
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,679
next slide please

2529
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:37,600
okay so basically

2530
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,719
we've so hard talked about the sets um

2531
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:43,360
there is a new working group in the open

2532
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,000
id foundation called the shared signals

2533
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,360
and events

2534
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,320
it is a framework that defines an api or

2535
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,159
interface if you will and i've put the

2536
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:53,440
link in there

2537
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,159
that does leverage the use of the

2538
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:59,119
delivery streams using sets

2539
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:02,719
using the set push and the set pull

2540
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:06,320
to manage effectively these streams that

2541
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,679
phil has been mentioning

2542
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:12,480
there are currently two schemas that are

2543
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,080
defined in their

2544
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,159
risk

2545
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:19,280
isn't quite going through last time if i

2546
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,960
recall

2547
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,280
but the one that has been approved is

2548
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,760
the continuous

2549
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,800
continuous authentication and evaluation

2550
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,920
protocol

2551
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,239
fondly known as as cape

2552
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:35,119
and so what i listed in the table is the

2553
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:37,040
different event types

2554
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,760
that are defined in each of the schemas

2555
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,560
um and cape is the one that

2556
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,400
the working group is mainly latching on

2557
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,520
next slide please

2558
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,679
and so i i think i lost the link there

2559
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:58,000
we do have um cisco did implement

2560
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,800
a reference implementation so if you're

2561
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,600
interested to see how it gets used

2562
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,560
um the link is uh

2563
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,719
shared signals guide

2564
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:10,080
dot io

2565
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,239
and if you guys are interested did i put

2566
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:14,320
it in there

2567
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:17,119
oh thank you i thought i'd put it in

2568
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:20,159
there it's there um

2569
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:24,560
basically the flow of um

2570
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,480
the flow that's defined and the shared

2571
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,280
signals and events are in steps two and

2572
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:32,480
three that are being described there

2573
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:36,159
um the one and two is basically an

2574
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,560
endpoint um

2575
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,800
doing the service request to a relying

2576
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,880
party

2577
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,400
and then the actual meat of getting the

2578
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,920
the event

2579
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,840
of um

2580
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,639
i'm a security so more like a security

2581
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:54,800
event like in cape your authentication

2582
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,960
token has been revoked

2583
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,960
is where that registration and pull

2584
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,840
happens in step two and three that's the

2585
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,920
shared signals and event work

2586
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,760
and then the actual enforcement or

2587
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,480
remediation um action

2588
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,000
is in step four

2589
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,440
so this is just like the stratospheric

2590
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:16,960
view of what sse does um we wanted to

2591
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,880
give you that introduction

2592
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,080
um so that you would know about it as

2593
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,880
we now bring it back to skim next slide

2594
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:28,639
please and so the major use case here

2595
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:30,159
that has been talked about since the

2596
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:31,760
beginning of skim

2597
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,320
keeping resources between skim servers

2598
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,119
coordinated and or in sync

2599
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:39,199
the specca that identifies two

2600
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:40,719
variations

2601
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:43,199
the domain-based replication has the

2602
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,040
objective that a single domain has a

2603
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,639
common schema

2604
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:49,119
and a common set of resources

2605
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:51,600
the idea is that coordination messages

2606
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,000
be sent to enable each skim server to

2607
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,119
stay in sync with the rest of the domain

2608
01:39:57,119 --> 01:39:59,199
with some minor exceptions an event

2609
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:01,679
message simply repeats the skim protocol

2610
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:03,600
request that is received

2611
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,920
it contains all the data necessary to

2612
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,840
process the request as if it were

2613
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,119
received

2614
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:11,679
via rc 7644

2615
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:14,400
the base scheme

2616
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:15,760
okay

2617
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,679
coordinated provisioning allows the

2618
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:19,679
receiver to know that a publisher's

2619
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:21,520
resource has changed

2620
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,199
what the type of change was and the

2621
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:24,560
attributes

2622
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,520
changed

2623
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,560
in this case a set does not contain any

2624
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,199
raw data except for the id

2625
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:34,320
and or the external id which already

2626
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,199
which are already shared between domains

2627
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,520
when a receiver gets an event it can

2628
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,080
mark its own resource as stale and take

2629
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,119
action

2630
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:45,360
for example after receiving an event the

2631
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,960
receiver can perform a skim get request

2632
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,119
from the publishing service provider to

2633
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:53,760
see the current resource representation

2634
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,199
and the receiver can then do a

2635
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:58,560
reconciliation of the change resource

2636
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,560
the reason for this two-step approach is

2637
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,719
that it avoids sharing of confidential

2638
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:04,800
information in scenarios that may

2639
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,560
involve out-of-band relays or otherwise

2640
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,400
more importantly if the domains care

2641
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,480
about different attributes a lot of data

2642
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,719
may simply not be necessary because

2643
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:18,400
replication is not the primary goal in

2644
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,400
coordinated provisioning mode the

2645
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,639
receiver only needs to act when an

2646
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,520
attribute it cares about has changed

2647
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,840
then when the receiver does perform a

2648
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,040
skim get to obtain the changed resource

2649
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,119
the server's normal access control can

2650
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:34,639
be used to filter attributes

2651
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:36,080
appropriately

2652
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,239
another advantage is that a receiver can

2653
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,480
wait to do reconciliation by simply

2654
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,960
marking a resource as stale and then

2655
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,440
update periodically either in minutes or

2656
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:48,239
hours in order to avoid repeated get

2657
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:50,639
requests for a rapidly changing resource

2658
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:52,320
such as a group

2659
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,080
we could have sent filtered data in the

2660
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,159
event for each feed subscriber kind of

2661
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,080
like a limited dvr

2662
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,840
but i believe this creates a number of

2663
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,520
problems one

2664
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,440
more event processing is events have to

2665
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:06,159
be specialized for every receiver

2666
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:08,159
and also the publisher has to know what

2667
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,159
data the receiver is actually interested

2668
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:10,960
in

2669
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,800
it has to have more awareness of the

2670
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,400
receiving domain

2671
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,040
this may cause demarcation and control

2672
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,480
issues next slide please

2673
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:22,239
okay

2674
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:24,800
and here what he's showing is that a

2675
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,840
client performs a normal skim protocol

2676
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,119
request via post put patch whatever to a

2677
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:34,159
skim service provider the skim provider

2678
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,480
responds with a successor fail

2679
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,600
if successful the provider then issues

2680
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:42,000
an event to replication receivers who in

2681
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,639
turn repeats the operation locally to

2682
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,320
stay in sync

2683
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,840
in the slide i've shown only one replica

2684
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:50,639
but

2685
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,760
it may be many to hundreds

2686
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,560
okay in the next slide

2687
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,119
for coordinated provisioning

2688
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:01,600
a series of skim operations are

2689
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,920
completed at a skim provider and then

2690
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,840
for each request

2691
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,000
events are sent out to registered

2692
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,280
receivers

2693
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,360
depending on the event a receiver may

2694
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,000
issue a skin get back to the publisher

2695
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,480
for the purpose of reconciliation once

2696
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,639
the modified resource is obtained the

2697
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:20,000
receiver then decides what

2698
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,480
reconciliation action to take

2699
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,239
further because the event simply marks

2700
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:25,440
the resource

2701
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,960
has changed a receiver can opt to wait

2702
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,480
like a minute

2703
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,560
turning multiple changes into a single

2704
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,040
get reconciliation this two-step

2705
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,600
approach treats events as triggers

2706
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,920
to take a future action or to reconcile

2707
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:42,320
the differences between the providers

2708
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,880
next slide

2709
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,159
so

2710
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,400
security

2711
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,639
yeah security signal events have been

2712
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:53,760
talked about by the skim working group

2713
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:56,639
prior to the risk or the shared signals

2714
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:57,600
group

2715
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,760
formation in essence

2716
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,600
these are higher level events that draw

2717
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,480
conclusions based on skim schema

2718
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,480
for example a password has changed or

2719
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,520
reset

2720
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,199
i should point out that these events in

2721
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,440
the draft

2722
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,000
as they are somewhat duplicative of the

2723
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,040
openid foundation shared signal risk

2724
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,320
events

2725
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,480
the reason i put them in the draft is

2726
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,480
that the identifiers

2727
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,320
used in skim events

2728
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:27,440
are the stable skim identifiers

2729
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,760
the ones used in the shared signals are

2730
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,320
somewhat more complex allowing different

2731
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,040
subject identifiers to be used

2732
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,280
i think we need to explore these events

2733
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,480
more thoroughly

2734
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:39,840
thoroughly

2735
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,239
to decide this skim should define its

2736
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,480
own signals or reference the external

2737
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:47,679
specifications like sse

2738
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:49,840
next slide

2739
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,400
because skim is actually a profile of

2740
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,000
http

2741
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,960
one of many http features

2742
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,400
are http respond async preferred

2743
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:04,960
requests as defined in rc 70 to 40.

2744
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,800
if we were to support this feature this

2745
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,560
would be one way skin providers could

2746
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,159
signal request

2747
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:12,400
completion event results

2748
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,560
this just seemed like a no greater

2749
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:17,199
no-brainer to include but i must confess

2750
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:19,040
i don't have a strong use case and i'm

2751
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,880
curious if anyone

2752
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,520
would have a use for this

2753
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,560
uh next slide

2754
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:28,800
okay so this one is just showing an

2755
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,400
overall flow

2756
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:34,719
of how we could do asynchronous events

2757
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:36,000
next slide

2758
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,560
please

2759
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,360
so

2760
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,880
uh this is to the meat of the draft

2761
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,119
the skim event profile defines a number

2762
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:46,960
of common claims

2763
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,040
jots use the term claims instead of

2764
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,800
attributes by the way

2765
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,400
of concern for skim are the following

2766
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,440
toe

2767
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,239
the time of event this is useful because

2768
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:00,159
as we consider how events are collected

2769
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:02,239
and arranged into streams

2770
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:04,159
some time will pass

2771
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:07,119
toe allows set to convey the time the

2772
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:09,199
actual event occurred as the skim

2773
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:12,159
service provider which may be earlier

2774
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:15,119
than the set issuance time

2775
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,520
which he's calling iat

2776
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,880
yet

2777
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,119
toe is important because if events are

2778
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:23,199
received out of sequence the toke can be

2779
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:26,400
used to reorder events

2780
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:30,239
txn is a transaction identifier

2781
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:32,159
which must be unique for each event that

2782
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:34,239
occurs in the skim service this value

2783
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:36,000
may be used to catch duplicate event

2784
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,080
messages that might occur depending on

2785
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,560
the delivery mechanism

2786
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,360
event of course is a claim kind

2787
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,440
of like skim uris

2788
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,000
the events claim is a json structure

2789
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,679
carrying event uri attributes against

2790
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:54,480
which a json object can be attached

2791
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,520
in the skim event profile each event uri

2792
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,920
contains the transaction

2793
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,080
details of the event

2794
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,320
inside an event schema object we define

2795
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,199
four attributes for skim an id external

2796
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:10,080
id attributes and data

2797
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,400
id and external id are obvious

2798
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,119
attribute lists modified attributes when

2799
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,520
raw information is not

2800
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,320
to be shared whereas data is used to

2801
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,520
pass

2802
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:26,159
the raw skim request eg for replication

2803
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:28,320
finally in the current draft

2804
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,040
i'm recommending that the jot subclaim

2805
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,920
be the uri of the skim resource that

2806
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,199
changed

2807
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:37,600
in most cases this gives the receiver

2808
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,920
quick access to do a skim get to obtain

2809
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,520
more information

2810
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,760
in many cases the receiver need not

2811
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,840
parse any other information other than

2812
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,800
the event type uri

2813
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,960
next slide please

2814
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,600
okay subject identifiers before i show

2815
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,360
you what an event looks like i'd like to

2816
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,320
talk about the sec event subject

2817
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:59,679
identifiers draft

2818
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:02,000
that's the draft that the ssc work uses

2819
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,119
by the way

2820
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:05,119
this draft defines many different types

2821
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:07,679
of identifiers that can be specified

2822
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:12,320
like email ip address telephone etc

2823
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:14,639
this draft was spawned

2824
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:17,199
out of the oidc

2825
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,360
world because of the way id tokens were

2826
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,239
used

2827
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:22,480
when an id token was issued the subject

2828
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,239
was not uniquely identified by the

2829
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:26,080
subplane it was always within the

2830
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,560
context of an iss claim

2831
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,639
and the subclaim together it turns out

2832
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:33,920
the iss claim was doing double duty

2833
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,400
it was both the issuer of the toker

2834
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:40,080
token and the issuer of this sub value

2835
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,000
this created problems

2836
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
for the openid clients that wanted to

2837
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,920
issue events they needed to be able to

2838
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,400
specify the originating issuer for the

2839
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,440
sub

2840
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,520
but the jot spec is defined as the

2841
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,840
issuer of the dot rather than the

2842
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:54,960
subject

2843
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,719
in order to do this the subject

2844
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,639
identifier spec

2845
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:01,520
came out this spec has been in process

2846
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,280
for about six years and has been

2847
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:06,159
difficult to obtain consensus

2848
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,960
that said they seem to be getting close

2849
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,440
and are still in last call

2850
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,520
in the case of skim i don't believe we

2851
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,679
have a subject identifier problem for a

2852
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,280
couple reasons

2853
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,320
skim clearly defines the id and external

2854
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,480
id mechanism for this purpose

2855
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,480
when resources are created there is

2856
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:26,840
already agreement on common

2857
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:29,840
identifiers two in a case where a skim

2858
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:32,239
client has forgotten an id

2859
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,880
the event provides a skim uri for the

2860
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,719
resource in the event

2861
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:38,719
and third the event receiver can finally

2862
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:40,719
perform a skin get to obtain any

2863
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:44,000
additional claim it needs to locate

2864
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,320
the corresponding local entity

2865
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,239
i recommend against using the skim

2866
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:50,560
subject identifier draft as this would

2867
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,159
open up skim

2868
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:54,480
receivers to having to process

2869
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:57,440
identifiers not typical of skin

2870
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,280
this optionality

2871
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:01,920
would decrease interoperability in order

2872
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,480
to align with a problem domain

2873
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:07,119
with unresolved standard agreements on

2874
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:09,280
identifiers

2875
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:11,840
next slide

2876
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:14,880
so in this example

2877
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,480
this is a

2878
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:19,599
typical event in this case a create

2879
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:20,800
event

2880
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,320
is being shown

2881
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:24,639
note that inside the events object we

2882
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:26,800
define a common set of attributes you've

2883
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:28,800
got the id external id data and

2884
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,239
attributes

2885
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,320
typically in dbr cases we show the

2886
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,159
actual transaction using the data

2887
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:35,280
attribute

2888
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,800
this attribute corresponds to the

2889
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,119
original skim request

2890
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:41,360
when this event is done for coordinated

2891
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,679
provisioning the data is not provided

2892
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:46,320
and instead attributes is provided with

2893
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,800
a set of attributes issued

2894
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,880
note that the create event actually

2895
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,760
includes an id whereas the skim create

2896
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:56,080
request does not

2897
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,719
why well remember set is an event that

2898
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:00,560
has already happened

2899
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,360
so

2900
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:04,480
the skim create event shows the id that

2901
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:09,520
was actually assigned okay next slide

2902
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:12,080
in addition to repeating the skim crud

2903
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,000
events there are a few other events that

2904
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,119
are important

2905
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:16,800
the feed events are about a learning a

2906
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,639
receiver about a new entity that they

2907
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:20,560
may not be aware of this happens when

2908
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:23,199
the user population in one domain is a

2909
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:25,760
subset of another for example users

2910
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,320
provision to sfdc

2911
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,880
might be users in azure that may have

2912
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,840
the role

2913
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:36,159
crm when sally has the entitlement of

2914
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:37,760
crm added

2915
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,920
sfdc is alerted

2916
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:40,880
of

2917
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:43,360
that the sally resource is now part of

2918
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,639
the fiend

2919
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:48,159
sfdc may need to first obtain the sally

2920
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:50,159
resource in order to provision sally

2921
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:51,599
into crm

2922
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:54,320
since no sally create event will have to

2923
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:57,520
will have been previously observed by

2924
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,679
salesforce sfdc

2925
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:02,639
in addition to the skim create put patch

2926
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:05,679
delete events i've also added activate

2927
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:07,760
and deactivate events because different

2928
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,360
service providers may have different

2929
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:12,320
meanings regarding regarding active and

2930
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:13,440
inactive

2931
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,480
etc a more generic event is defined so

2932
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,960
that publishers and receivers can better

2933
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:22,400
coordinate um on activation

2934
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,480
for now i've only defined two risk-like

2935
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,760
signals

2936
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:28,560
auth method change and password reset

2937
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,239
we should keep talking about how we want

2938
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:32,320
to approach these events

2939
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,159
these are different in that the audience

2940
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:36,480
of the event may not be a skim system

2941
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,560
client or provider

2942
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,400
finally as previously discussed the

2943
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:43,440
async response event is also included

2944
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:45,839
next slide

2945
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:48,560
in the event profile i've described a

2946
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,400
couple different delivery mechanisms in

2947
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,080
part because i felt it important to

2948
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:54,960
describe how events might be exchanged

2949
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,880
and how it might be managed looking at

2950
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,040
this i saw two road categories for

2951
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,239
delivery

2952
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:02,000
bus based systems and point point

2953
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,520
systems

2954
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:06,000
nancy me i've already spoken about the

2955
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,920
shared signals event framework and the

2956
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,679
set transfer specs

2957
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:11,520
but the other i wanted to point out was

2958
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,119
message buses

2959
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:15,199
many companies may have large

2960
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:17,440
investments and message buses

2961
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:19,679
in the skim case they're useful because

2962
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:21,520
you don't have to describe complex

2963
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,920
hierarchies of server interconnects that

2964
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:25,440
mandate master

2965
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:26,639
servers

2966
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:28,960
all barriers to global infrastructures

2967
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,520
and scale instead message buses become

2968
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,840
convenient for a number of reasons

2969
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,920
a bus can implement infinite event

2970
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,000
recovery if desired

2971
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,719
each skim server only connects to one

2972
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:42,719
bus rather than each other

2973
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:44,800
the bus takes care of delivery recovery

2974
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,880
and fault tolerance having each server

2975
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,639
connect to one bus rather than each

2976
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:50,400
other dramatically simplifies

2977
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,000
configuration

2978
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,679
credential management and the number of

2979
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:55,360
event transfers

2980
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,520
finally a bus can also act as an

2981
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:00,000
auditable record for changes in systems

2982
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,840
over time

2983
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:04,639
still with all those benefits when we go

2984
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:06,719
cross-domain we want to control the flow

2985
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:08,639
through a limited set of connections or

2986
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:09,760
gateway

2987
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,360
in this case

2988
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:14,639
ssc becomes advantageous

2989
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:15,760
next slide

2990
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,840
so what's out of scope because events

2991
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,159
are statements of fact of what has

2992
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:22,480
occurred rather than commands

2993
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,320
the spec doesn't prescribe what a

2994
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,560
receiver must or should do other than

2995
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,239
the message itself

2996
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:30,560
the breakthrough of set is to avoid

2997
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,639
prescriptions and to focus on triggers

2998
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:34,480
or signals that enable independent

2999
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:35,760
action

3000
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,599
because there are many delivery systems

3001
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:39,440
the spec will only talk about the basic

3002
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:42,360
mechanisms and any privacy and security

3003
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:44,560
considerations that flow from those

3004
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:45,760
systems

3005
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:46,960
thanks

3006
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,960
okay

3007
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,599
i was slower than phil sorry

3008
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,760
we have five minutes before we're done

3009
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:58,239
we can take comments questions so tim

3010
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:00,560
tim capela microsoft and just uh

3011
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,239
disclosure i'm the chair of one of the

3012
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:04,639
chairs of the ssc working group um

3013
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,880
can you go back one side

3014
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,320
i think the the statement around

3015
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,760
commands i think is super important here

3016
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,520
right so when we look at sse and what

3017
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,080
it's doing it's it's a statement of fact

3018
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,920
that in the view of the transmitter

3019
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,119
right so

3020
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,840
my only concern here is

3021
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:22,400
to take a dependency on ssc in a

3022
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:25,280
protocol those are more commands than

3023
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,599
signals right your in my opinion at

3024
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:28,800
least the way i understand it right you

3025
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,400
are you are

3026
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,800
using this method to convey

3027
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,199
protocol operations versus

3028
01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:37,920
observations by a single party if that

3029
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,040
makes sense so that's that's my only

3030
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,440
concern i i'm super happy to see sse

3031
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,520
getting

3032
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,360
visibility here um that's just my only

3033
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,400
concern right because that's been a

3034
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:48,719
super important distinction

3035
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:51,040
for sse at least as its kind of position

3036
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:54,560
say doesn't mean it can't change but

3037
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:02,320
all right uh leslie was on so

3038
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,639
i guess i'll echo that and also say that

3039
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:07,119
that like the implementation complexity

3040
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:09,119
of this worries me a little bit

3041
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:10,000
um

3042
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,679
in like the way

3043
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:13,119
if i were

3044
01:56:13,119 --> 01:56:14,800
starting from a white sheet of paper i

3045
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,239
would probably

3046
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:19,520
limit myself to just signaling

3047
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,679
that something

3048
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:24,320
has happened to a schema resource and

3049
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,159
let the receiver figure out what to do

3050
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:28,560
with that information whether it means

3051
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,800
re-synchronizing the schema resource or

3052
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,800
not sending along

3053
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:36,159
a lot of data with the the event

3054
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:39,040
adds a whole bunch of complexity around

3055
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,199
stuff like item potency and you know

3056
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:44,000
access control and the security model

3057
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,199
is affected

3058
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:46,880
there's there's so much complexity in

3059
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:49,040
this that i again i i worry about

3060
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:51,760
implementability i i would

3061
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:52,880
maybe

3062
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:54,480
like

3063
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,400
ask the working group to think about

3064
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,159
sort of whether this is actually needed

3065
01:56:58,159 --> 01:56:59,920
or whether we can get away with a very

3066
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,599
very simple event-based model for

3067
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,040
synchronization you're saying that

3068
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,119
something has happened and let the skim

3069
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:08,159
client figure it out

3070
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:11,920
okay um so i'm just gonna echo phil here

3071
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:13,520
from the chat

3072
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,280
but i'm not sure tim it might have been

3073
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,679
to your comment uh of that's why i

3074
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:20,639
anticipate dbr happening

3075
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:23,440
over buses versus

3076
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:25,119
cooperative arrests

3077
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:27,040
yeah i guess i guess

3078
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,040
i i don't think you want two different

3079
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:30,159
skim is supposed to be very

3080
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:32,400
authoritative correct so i don't think

3081
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:35,360
you want two different pieces of skim

3082
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,719
for the operation of the protocol that

3083
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:38,320
one is do what you want and one is

3084
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:39,679
authoritative like that that's

3085
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:41,199
concerning to me right if you're

3086
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:42,880
ultimately yeah i don't know that again

3087
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:44,800
i can be easily convinced i'm just that

3088
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:45,840
was my first reaction should be a

3089
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,520
question of clarifying

3090
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:52,440
the applicability and use case yep

3091
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:00,239
okay um

3092
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:02,480
did he have questions that i didn't okay

3093
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:05,280
so phil actually had questions that i i

3094
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:08,800
failed to go through

3095
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:12,159
so in the interest of time

3096
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:14,560
perhaps what we'll do is

3097
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:17,599
solicit more feedback over the mail list

3098
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:20,080
and then we can talk about applicability

3099
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:23,199
and adoption at a later point

3100
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:25,599
based on on the questions that phil

3101
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:27,599
has posted

3102
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:29,679
um

3103
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:30,880
okay

3104
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:33,280
we have a minute and a half left any

3105
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:38,159
other orders of business questions

3106
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:41,360
we actually stayed on time

3107
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:42,320
all right

3108
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:45,920
thank you um oh one last logistics

3109
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:48,400
does the group want to continue with the

3110
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:52,239
uh every four-week virtual

3111
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:53,920
for progress

3112
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,880
every six weeks

3113
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:02,639
i'm going to say every six weeks um let

3114
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:04,639
me put a poll

3115
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:07,679
do you want to continue

3116
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:11,520
with an every six-week

3117
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,360
virtual ver

3118
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:15,199
if i could only type

3119
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:17,599
that would be dangerous okay

3120
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:20,000
um can you raise your hand if if you

3121
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,239
want to continue with every six weeks

3122
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:25,638
we'll have a virtual

3123
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:35,679
how many participants do we have

3124
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,040
yeah no i was looking at this

3125
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,599
to see when

3126
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:54,480
we kind of have rough consensus

3127
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:56,960
so i i can put that on the mail list as

3128
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:59,520
well

3129
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:01,920
and we can try and schedule a virtual

3130
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:04,480
for the next six weeks and then

3131
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:07,199
we'll evaluate after that

3132
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:08,880
all right

3133
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,119
with that i thank you

3134
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:14,480
for joining and participating and we are

3135
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:15,920
right on time

3136
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:19,239
thanks everyone

3137
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:23,819
[Applause]

3138
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,360
yeah it was funny because you kept

3139
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:42,639
telling me

3140
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:44,800
closer but then

3141
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,040
it's like because i was watching the

3142
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:51,560
chat and you're like there's a

3143
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,000
hey

3144
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,159
so i actually think

3145
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:05,440
doing

3146
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:07,040
maybe i need to read the

3147
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,199
it's the notion of hey you need to

3148
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:11,520
synchronize jesus christ

3149
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,840
now you sure
