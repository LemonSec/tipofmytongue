2
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,600
uh

3
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
i think we can start it's the top of the

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,520
hour one o'clock

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680

welcome everybody to the lisp working

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,520
group session for the people in the room

8
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,159
and everybody that is online i hope

9
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,119
every everybody is fine

10
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,479
um

11
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,400
the usual not well

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
you supposed to read this

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,360
during the registration process uh the

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,080
ietf

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,840
some tips about this hybrid setup so

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
in person you can log in in the

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,159
lightweight tool midiko tool is the

18
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,600
small

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,360
mobile phone icon that you have on the

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,799
agenda

21
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,840
by that you automatically sign the blue

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
sheets and if you wish you can actually

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,960
if you are a presenter decide to share

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,200
the content so your slides and you can

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
control the the slides

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,799
plan b is i share and you just say next

27
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
okay

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,280
as for the good old times

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,479
remote participants is the

30
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,119
mythical setup we had in the last two

31
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,318
years basically so you you

32
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,319
you see the the video screen audio

33
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,440
stream

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,959
the jabber uh

35
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,840
chat okay as usual

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200
for the questions remote and here in the

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
room you queue up so you raise your hand

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
from the mythical tool

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
and you for the person here in the room

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
you go to the mic only when it's up to

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,319
you to ask the question you don't need

42
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,480
to physically queue up okay

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,200
and when you start speaking please give

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,560

uh

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
just a a small reminder of the code of

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,959
conduct which is important here in the

49
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,120
iaetf is about

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
respecting everybody here in the room

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,760
and online

52
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,599
to having personal discussion always

53
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,840
based on technical

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,959
points

55
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
and now that everybody's already

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,958
configured here okay so

57
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,000
uh

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,360
i forgot i'm luigi uh joel is online

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
here we are the coaches of the groups

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
padma our secretary is also

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,519
currently online remotely on the medical

62
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,560
system

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,599
here you have the usual pointers for

64
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,599
everything the charter the jabber room

65
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,200
three mythical

66
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,360
agenda and slides so here also the

67
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
material the slides that you are seeing

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,200
right now

69
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
um

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,680
a quick update on the status that

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,879
of our working group so we have uh a few

72
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,760
documents five actually that are already

73
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,640
in the

74
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,360
rfc editor queue which is a good point

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,280
okay they are just a little bit stuck

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,799
there because

77
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,680
that they have references to documents

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,879
that are still in the pipeline actually

79
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,720
we have five

80
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,159
that are in the

81
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,120
in alvaro's queue

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
because they passed the working group uh

83
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
last call i mean so

84
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,920
they alvaro needs some time to process

85
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
not only our documents but all the the

86
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,199
the working groups that he is

87
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,880
overseeing right

88
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
and

89
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,199
there is the it's difficult to read but

90
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,040
the last document at the bottom is the

91
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
young model

92
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
which has have been discussed i think

93
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,960
last year and i'm sure we are critical

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,440
close to the working group plus calls so

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,080
at some point this year we may

96
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,560
go for it i would say

97
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
okay

98
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,040
um

99
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,479
today

100
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,639
the other working group documents are

101
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,360
the

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,720
uh

103
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,680
lisp l2l3 id mobility we will have a

104
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,040
presentation today the young model uh

105
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,000
um i just said

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,520
uh

107
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
will not be discussed today there is a

108
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,720
mistake in

109
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
in the slides and then there are a few

110
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
documents actually that are there and we

111
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,120
should try this here to discuss whether

112
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,320
or not we want to move them forward

113
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,360
uh and so go for uh conclude the work

114
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,400
and go for a working group plus call or

115
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
check whether the working groupers want

116
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
to drop

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
the

118
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,720
this work um

119
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,919
we have a few tasks to be accomplished i

120
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,759
would say there is the

121
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,560
the not traversal document

122
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
that should be done and there was a an

123
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
explicit request in the charter we have

124
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
it in the chapter so would be good if we

125
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,560
also focus on

126
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
on this one this year

127
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,080
um

128
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,160
the lisptdt

129
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
rfc

130
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,000
so 81111

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,600
we have a earlier location in that

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,880
document but the document is

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,720
experimental

134
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
which means to to make the allocation

135
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,960
permanent

136
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,479
we need to

137
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,720
uh

138
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,520
move the document the list ddt uh on the

139
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,280
standard track

140
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,039
so

141
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,440
we have to think about have a

142
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,560
one eight one one one piece in order to

143
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
standardize

144
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,520
also the the ddt system okay what does

145
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,758
it mean

146
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,039
so there is uh the fact that uh

147
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,039
in the ayana we have a lisp packet type

148
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,319
defined in

149
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,880
this rfc

150
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,520
is experimental so could not be

151
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,280
permanent because is experimental

152
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
now

153
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
to make it permanent and the point is we

154
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,880
are renewing this for the second time

155
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,080
which means

156
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,720
uh the first time we just asked second

157
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,319
first renewal was we with the ad alvaro

158
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,840
that said that's fine

159
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,280
now we have a d and ist that has to say

160
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,479
it's okay

161
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,000
so

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,479
we don't have so much time

163
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,599
so

164
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,840
because i don't know how much we can

165
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
ask continue asking to renew the

166
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,440
allocation okay

167
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
so we we

168
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,240
i think these are two two main things we

169
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
should try to accomplish this here so

170
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,840
the nut and

171
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,759
ddt base let's say okay

172
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,199
and as for the agenda today

173
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,759
the administrative is over uh we have

174
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,919
aid mobility alberto will be present

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,319
okay

176
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,360
okay alberto beast will present so funny

177
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,599
so you you will present a reliable

178
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,440
transport okay

179
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,360
then we have bernard

180
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,080
heindel if i pronounce correctly which

181
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
will present the crown based lisp okay

182
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
and then sharon will give an update on

183
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,879
the lisp mobility routing so unless

184
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,800
there is anybody who wants to do any

185
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
agenda bashing

186
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,360
fabio you can come up you want me to

187
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,000
share okay

188
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,399
all right so this is a quick update um

189
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,640
about the eid mobility

190
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,799
draft

191
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,919
yeah so this is the usual suspect of

192
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,760
authors

193
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,839
there were a few comments that came up

194
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,240
uh in the last

195
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,360
itf

196
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,560
online

197
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,839
and

198
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,720
we

199
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,640
didn't have a chance to update the

200
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
document

201
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,120
yet

202
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,640
but

203
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
you know

204
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,920
there was some work on layer 2

205
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,480
multi-homing

206
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
that needs to be done to complete the

207
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,040
the last section in the document itself

208
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,920
um

209
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,680
i just have an update

210
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
on the

211
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,959
discussion that went in the mailing list

212
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,640
so we can go to the to the next slide

213
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,440
and

214
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,640
basically uh what this was raised at the

215
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,360
at the last meeting as i as i said right

216
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,480
so

217
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,440
the question is how do we identify the

218
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,959
uh layer 2

219
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,720
multi-homing groups

220
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,920
and the

221
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,080
the discussion and the problem is you

222
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,360
know uh if there is a

223
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,560
site that is multi-home uh how can you

224
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,760
identify universally uh the

225
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
um

226
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
the group um when there are multiple

227
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,080
unlock that are present in that site

228
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,959
so

229
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,000
um

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,560
there was some discussion should we

231
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,680
use

232
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,720
the site id or should we go up for

233
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,120
a new identifier

234
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,920
at all so next slide

235
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,079
and it seems that the conversation is

236
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,920
going toward using a new identifier the

237
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,560
internet segment id

238
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,880
it's a 32-bit value

239
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,120
that will identify

240
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,240
uniquely

241
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,920
the group of xdrs

242
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
the

243
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
xcrs that are multi-home they get regis

244
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,320
they get to register their

245
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,519
esid

246
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,320
with the corresponding lock and in this

247
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,920
way the mapping system can aggregate the

248
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
multiple airlocks

249
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,399
so that they all part of the same

250
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,440
group

251
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,079
in this way the two issues that you want

252
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,680
to solve are

253
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,079
individuate univocally with the

254
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,040
designated forwarder select it

255
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,640
and

256
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,680
basically

257
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,200
have a way

258
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,959
that you can reconcile when there is a

259
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,760
split horizon solution

260
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,600
um

261
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
in addition

262
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
uh in this way

263
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,959
ethernet segment id can also be

264
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,760
associated to eids not only uh 200 lock

265
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,560
and in this way you can deal with the

266
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,279
alliancing that allow for

267
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,519
load balancing

268
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,200
when multi-arming is

269
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,959
is active

270
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,800
and yeah so this i think is the part

271
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,640
that uh where progress was made um

272
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,279
we will update the the text to reflect

273
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,360
this consideration here

274
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,440
and i think that's the last slide there

275
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
is another one

276
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,040
uh okay the last slide

277
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,279
and there is dino in the queue for a

278
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,640
question hey dino

279
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,920
we miss you you're me this is dino

280
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
hey

281
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,480
hi

282
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
long time you can hear me okay

283
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,000
so um

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,360
i um

285
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
i remember recalling uh that there was

286
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,079
no reason not to use the site id do you

287
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,519
know why that has changed and um because

288
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,959
because now we have an issue because

289
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,120
what if the site id is different than

290
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,639
the esid

291
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,680
is are the are the xtrs known to be in

292
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,440
the same site or not

293
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
um so

294
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,399
and the reason why at last itf we talked

295
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,959
about or the ietf in the summer we

296
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,800
talked about um

297
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,320
using the site idea so we wouldn't have

298
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,800
to change the packet formats

299
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,160
so do you know

300
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,720
what um what uh

301
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,120
came up to want to make that change

302
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,880
yeah um can i take that yes

303
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,760
yeah so you know this is actually

304
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
reflecting the

305
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,200
the discussion on the mailing list where

306
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,360
you set a nation is a good point

307
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,560
that an xtr may have different vlans

308
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
so you may have different

309
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,440
segments on the on the xtr

310
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,839
and then you may or may not want to put

311
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,079
them uh in the same site id or like the

312
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:08,880
same

313
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,480
using a single site i need to cover all

314
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,279
those

315
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,279
different layer 2 segments

316
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,000
so we were kind of um

317
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,279
assimilating your point and trying to

318
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,399
to

319
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
to to be coherent with the discussion on

320
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,760
the list

321
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,320
ah so that's what's confusing because

322
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,680
the um

323
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,880
the slides say that it's an esid for two

324
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,160
xtrs where it's actually an esid per

325
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,760
vlan per pair of xtrs or more than one

326
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,120
is that true

327
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
yeah i guess

328
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
yeah maybe yeah the flash were not the

329
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,920
specific

330
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,320
i guess one way to put it is

331
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,959
the esid would be for layer two segment

332
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,720
which i guess you can say like turbulent

333
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
if you wish

334
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,800
does that make sense now

335
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,920
yeah maybe you should call it a vlan

336
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,360
segment idea something like that but and

337
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
it needs to be clear

338
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,600
um

339
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
and this these are put in registers

340
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,079
that's going to be a long list of

341
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,600
it could be a long list right

342
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,519
uh yeah but i mean if we have different

343
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,199
segments there are different segments

344
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,000
right

345
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,240
yeah i'm not sure and now i'm going to

346
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,199
have up to 4 000 entries in it so

347
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,360
there's a lot of protocol machinery that

348
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,600
has to be done

349
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,160
so regarding the the name i may need to

350
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,639
check i believe that ethernet seminar is

351
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,240
what other protocols use as well but i'm

352
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
fine if we want to call it here bill an

353
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,399
id either way i think at least for me i

354
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,079
don't know if someone else has no okay

355
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,760
it doesn't matter really what the name

356
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,920
is that's just a moot point

357
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,639
but i'm worried about the scalability of

358
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,320
this now can't can't we say that um

359
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,199
um one one or more xtr's are

360
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,120
selected as a designated forwarder for

361
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,839
all vlans

362
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,240
like a default

363
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,760
because this is the big change of the

364
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,279
map register and i don't know if it's

365
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,360
worth it for l2 um

366
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,160
for l2 um overlays that's the thing i'm

367
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,320
worried about there's there's a big cost

368
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,120
here

369
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,399
in um

370
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,279
designing this in for the benefit so i'm

371
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,800
making a judgment call that's all

372
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,279
yeah um i don't have an answer for you

373
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,240
dinner and actually you are the

374
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,920
multicast especially so i would one and

375
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,800
ask you

376
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,600
um

377
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,759
so the the esid

378
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,600
is intended to address at least three

379
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,880
problems like this in the frequent

380
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,959
multicast the split rise and then the

381
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,560
the alliancing on on the on the 80s

382
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,959
so if you have a specific

383
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,160
you know optimization for the

384
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
residential for water case we can

385
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,839
certainly

386
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,079
include that

387
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,279
yeah what i'm

388
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,759
what i'm suggesting is use site id and

389
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,040
you use designated forwarder election or

390
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,079
selection

391
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,920
for all vlans that's all

392
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,199
and you just

393
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,120
you make that statement and we don't

394
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
have to change the packet formats

395
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,920
uh i'm not entirely sure that

396
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,680
we are back in the program that we have

397
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,000
originally right that you may have

398
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,480
multiple villains in the same xtr yeah

399
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,519
but i didn't suggest it's a all or one

400
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,399
um

401
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,240
issue that's how we could solve the

402
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
problem

403
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,199
because now you have now you have to

404
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,160
list each vlans that are active well

405
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,560
you have to you have to potentially have

406
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,639
up to 4 000 entries in the map register

407
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,639
which makes the packet really large

408
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,680
right

409
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,639
and even if vlans are not in use if one

410
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,720
gets configured at some point

411
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,560
you have to know who the designated

412
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,199
forwarder is at um

413
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,880
at the

414
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,560
you have to do it before you configure

415
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,800
the vlans at the site i think

416
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,560
or you're going to have a broadcast loop

417
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
right

418
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,079
yeah regarding the number of vlans

419
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,920
uh

420
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,759
another financial i mean i

421
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,959
so can you have really like let's say

422
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,039
a registration where you would have all

423
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,679
the vlans configured at once because

424
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,640
you

425
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,959
usually you send a

426
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,799
a registration which is eid to unlock

427
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
right

428
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,240
and then we need to add an identifier to

429
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
to map the airbox but also to mount the

430
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,559
the id for the aliasing case

431
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:24,819
so

432
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,367
[Music]

433
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,880
albert it doesn't matter if it's um

434
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
all it could be 50 and that's still a

435
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,960
lot right because now you have to list

436
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,440
everything

437
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,320
string

438
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,200
and

439
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,559
you understand what you're saying you

440
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,480
know i'm thinking from the you know kind

441
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,760
of operation of the protocol that

442
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
typically you send a single eid on the

443
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,320
map theoretically you can send more

444
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,240
but typically you send just one eid

445
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,640
right per map register message

446
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,640
so

447
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,678
um

448
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,400
yeah but if

449
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,600
yeah you might

450
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,280
i mean no you may want to pack them

451
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,160
right

452
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,440
you may but typically we don't do that

453
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
i don't remember now the text on the biz

454
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,840
documents it may even say that this is

455
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
not

456
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,440
yeah i don't want to to code the test

457
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
with without having the rfs on top of me

458
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,440
in front of me but um

459
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,799
yeah that's why i'm saying it's not

460
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,000
worth it because there's a lot more

461
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,240
discussion that has to go in like how

462
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
you're going to do it

463
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,080
so let's let's let's do this dinner

464
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,480
let's maybe for the next atf we

465
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,799
between now and then we can look at the

466
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,320
scalability of the you know number of

467
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,360
villains

468
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,960
and we can discuss in the next idea of

469
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,640
how to how to handle that sounds good

470
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,240
you can even start the discussion

471
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,480
yeah yeah

472
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
do you want to send in one

473
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,080
note to the mailing list and we use that

474
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
to start the basically what you're

475
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,120
saying is that we should consider

476
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,039
scalability because

477
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,480
there are

478
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,120
up to 4 000

479
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,679
entries uh for each id any id can be uh

480
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,480
grouped in registration

481
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,640
yeah and the other problem is

482
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,480
is that there's one

483
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,280
there's one segment id per map register

484
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,880
where if it's if you're going to put

485
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,160
multiple

486
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,960
mac address eids in the map register

487
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
then you have to have an e es

488
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,200
es id per eid which means it has to go

489
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,679
in the eid record

490
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,160
which means now you have to specify

491
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
wherever an eid record is used in all

492
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,640
the messages you have to specify

493
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,799
what the segment id is

494
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,280
and for layer 3 you don't even need it

495
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,799
so you're gonna end up using up the

496
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,440
space uh inefficiently for layer three

497
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,039
that's why i think it should be all or

498
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,080
nothing

499
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,320
you you select the designated forward

500
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,240
for the site for all vlans

501
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,039
so if we end up with a map register that

502
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,720
is too big there is something that

503
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,000
solves it that is called reliable

504
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,360
transfer we're going to talk about that

505
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,760
in a second so

506
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,440
so we gathered that you support the

507
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,960
transfer

508
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,039
we are stretching it a bit

509
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,039
okay that's okay i think we have an

510
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,840
action uh dino if you can post

511
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,240
a note to the mailing list uh regardless

512
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,559
scalability considerations and we can

513
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,280
take it from there

514
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,799
yep sounds good i'll do it thank you

515
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,360
thanks dino

516
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,520
so

517
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,760
the queue seems empty so all right

518
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,039
that's how you can

519
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,280
come up

520
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,039
so now very timely right reliable

521
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,960
transfer solving some issues like two

522
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,880
large map registers um

523
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,400
so next

524
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,799
okay uh yeah this is again

525
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,240
trying to

526
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,559
summarize or address some

527
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,960
changes that has happened on the draft

528
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,760
uh well i mean no no no but um in the

529
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,880
mailing list

530
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,720
that we have discussed since last itf

531
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
mainly these two points

532
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,559
that is um

533
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,520
if an etf supports travel transfer how

534
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,640
does it know that you know the map

535
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
server supports it too so it can switch

536
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
to rival transfer

537
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,159
and and then the question about what

538
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,000
about other transfer protocols that are

539
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
not just tcp and we've been there the

540
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,840
main the main example so next

541
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,440
so the problem of um

542
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,600
an etr that

543
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,960
wants to use variable transfer but

544
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,720
doesn't know if the map server supports

545
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,600
it right

546
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,799
so

547
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,880
by default the atr is going to always

548
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,280
start with udp map registers that is

549
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,200
what the protocol specifies

550
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,840
and at some point it needs to

551
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,559
to do something right so it can switch

552
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,440
to

553
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,360
to variable transfer if the maps are

554
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,919
supposed to so so how can we deal with

555
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,880
this next

556
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
and

557
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,720
i think this is what was discussed um

558
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,240
as part of the you know the follow-up

559
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,159
front from last meeting that is okay we

560
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,760
have some bits available on the

561
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,000
map register message so we could

562
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,440
potentially use one to signal that the

563
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
etl wants to establish a reliable

564
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,799
transport

565
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,080
with the map server a real

566
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,320
transformation with an observer

567
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,200
so

568
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
this is the classical discussion that we

569
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,760
have had in you know multiple

570
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,559
times in the working group that is we

571
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,559
set up a new bit to one

572
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,240
uh if the

573
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
and we're gonna see the bits in in the

574
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
next couple of slides we set the new bit

575
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
to one if the map server supports

576
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,240
drivable transfer it's gonna reply with

577
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,080
with the the equivalent bit in the

578
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,159
modified set to one as well

579
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,480
if it doesn't superior transfer or the

580
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,960
map server is another one that

581
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,360
uh or sorry if if it supports triable

582
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,919
transfer but it doesn't want enable or

583
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,520
if the mapster is another one that

584
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,600
doesn't supervise transport then the

585
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,280
maven notify is going to come back with

586
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,080
the with the bit to zero so that way the

587
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,039
etr knows if it can or cannot establish

588
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,880
a available transfer session with the

589
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,960
windows server so next

590
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,520
uh so this is showing the

591
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,080
possible location of the

592
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,760
travel transfer bit

593
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,440
on the map register

594
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,320
we seems which seems straightforward i

595
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,640
think the the next slide i think the map

596
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,320
notify one may be more interesting

597
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
because uh one question for the working

598
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,919
group is

599
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,440
um where do we put the bit on the

600
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,679
magnitude five so this slide is showing

601
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,840
the beat in the same position as in the

602
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,080
map registers it's kind of mirroring the

603
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,000
map register

604
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,960
methods

605
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,640
but we don't need to put it there i

606
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,320
honestly don't have a strong opinion

607
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,720
there i don't know if anyone wants to

608
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,480
to comment on that

609
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,080
but this is something we need to to

610
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,679
decide where the

611
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,279
the the bit goes

612
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,960
next

613
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,400
did you take questions

614
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,520
i think it should be uh

615
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,640
that lowercase r bit in the map notify

616
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,520
should be um next to the record count

617
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,520
field because if you need to use um

618
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,440
more bits in the map notify you want to

619
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
keep the contiguous bits there say you

620
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,799
need

621
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,440
10 bits then you would have to split up

622
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,520
that new field on either side of the

623
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
yard so i'd make it right justified

624
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,640
that's that's that's fine with me yeah i

625
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,840
don't know if anyone has any other

626
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,320
opinions

627
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,799
so yeah unless someone wants to do

628
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,320
otherwise we can

629
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,000
put it close to the record count

630
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,840
okay i guess you can continue

631
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,640
okay the

632
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,240
the other point to discuss is quick

633
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,600
support

634
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,880
um

635
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,799
i guess that there are two questions

636
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,159
regarding quick

637
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,039
and i'm not a quick especially so i may

638
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,960
miss some some aspects here but one

639
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,640
point is which port are we gonna use for

640
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
quick

641
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,440
rebel transfer right for

642
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,640
tcp travel transfer is evident we use

643
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,200
for the d42 in tcp

644
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,960
and that's fine for

645
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,279
quick uh shall we

646
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,520
reserve a different port

647
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,400
so we just use

648
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,000
4342 udp with quick on top so we use any

649
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,279
port that we specify as default

650
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,000
um to be honest i don't have an answer

651
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,080
for for this one

652
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,720
um maybe let's see let's just chat with

653
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
bina before we move to the second okay

654
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
do you know

655
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,080
um yeah you can't use 4342

656
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,120
because then the list daemon

657
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
in the implementation will receive quick

658
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,200
encoded messages

659
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,919
and so it has to just use quick as it's

660
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,559
defined today

661
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,039
so what

662
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,400
if you use 40 42 right

663
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,480
how did you see this dina because i for

664
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,799
me right now it's an open question like

665
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,600
which part do we use

666
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,159
use the use the udp port number that's

667
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,080
assigned to quick in the standard

668
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,039
i i did a quick search on the i didn't

669
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,720
find it but i may be

670
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,240
you know missing it because i'm not

671
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,159
quick ester so is there you know if

672
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,120
there is a

673
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,080
quick port on the quick standard

674
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
absolutely

675
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,039
okay fair enough or it can't run over

676
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,320
udp

677
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,640
right so

678
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,440
um

679
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,520
yes and send it on the list maybe or

680
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,840
send it to the authors of the draft and

681
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,200
we can use that number um

682
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,279
you don't have to specify it

683
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,960
just like you're not specifying how to

684
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,000
use

685
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,720
well you're specifying how to use tcp

686
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,520
because um

687
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,720
um let's see

688
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,880
if you want

689
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
give me the phone you don't send an

690
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,600
application doesn't send over udp and

691
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,000
then sends over quick it interfaces with

692
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,720
quick directly right but on which part

693
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,360
that's the question

694
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,799
so for me the question is which port

695
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,080
number oh i see because the the reliable

696
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,840
transport now

697
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,760
for over tcp

698
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,159
uses 4342

699
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,200
tcp

700
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,440
that's correct

701
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,600
oh i think this is another udp port

702
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,720
number then

703
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,520
right

704
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,640
yeah

705
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,039
that's yeah that's what i'm trying to do

706
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,520
that doesn't that doesn't make sense

707
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,320
i think we're missing something

708
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,440
i i think that there is a different

709
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,200
difference between

710
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,159
the quick socket that you open and you

711
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,480
decide a certain port number and what is

712
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,720
going on the wire on the wire you will

713
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,799
see quick with the

714
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,440
port number quick port number somehow

715
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
i'm not sure i'm not an expert yeah

716
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,600
there is just a wireless but we need to

717
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,679
climb so

718
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,000
this is okay so what number one should

719
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,960
say

720
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,840
um should we reserve quick port 4342

721
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,200
but that is not because on the wire you

722
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,279
don't see two udp headers in this

723
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,240
message correct

724
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,520
so

725
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,799
if i i mean he if you want to connect

726
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,600
with tweaks on a specific port number

727
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,039
maybe this is

728
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,600
doable how is it is done i don't know

729
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,760
but we should just look at the same

730
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,240
technique i would say but

731
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,559
we need to check and discuss on the main

732
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,240
list but i think we should make it

733
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,360
consistent with tcp right use the same

734
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,600
control port number for that transport

735
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
layer so to speak

736
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,159
so you know the the substrate of of

737
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,279
quick is gdp as far as i know they do

738
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,679
you know upper things but the baseline

739
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,399
is is udp so yeah yeah but the

740
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,320
application doesn't care about it just

741
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,559
like the application doesn't care

742
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,200
that lisp can run over

743
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,960
the

744
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,919
lisp the application that runs over tcp

745
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,799
doesn't care that tcp runs over ip

746
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,559
just like it shouldn't care that quick

747
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,440
runs over udp because it's a lower layer

748
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,799
and it's not

749
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,480
it's modular and it doesn't need to know

750
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,399
that information and shouldn't touch it

751
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,279
because

752
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,440
the one who's originating

753
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,480
the udp packet is the quick protocol not

754
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
list blisp just runs over

755
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,440
a quick socket so to speak right

756
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,320
but

757
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,080
the there are the documents the list

758
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,760
documents today they are very clear on

759
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,960
which ports we should use for tcp or udp

760
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,200
right so at least at least a demon or

761
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,679
this one and then it's gonna listen on

762
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,000
on those ports and and be able to parse

763
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,640
and understand the least messages right

764
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,399
yes agree so what i'm trying to say is

765
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,679
we say that lisp runs over udp port 4342

766
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,520
over tcp port 4342 and over quickport

767
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,000
4342.

768
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,200
that's all

769
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
so what confused me and what triggered

770
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,679
the question that number one has udp

771
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,360
here okay

772
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,159
so

773
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,200
i think that

774
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,799
we are you know going to a more

775
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,559
fundamental question and i guess this

776
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,679
may be a quick discussion but so

777
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,760
tcp and gdp you identify those by the

778
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,000
protocol identifier right

779
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,600
quick as far as i know and i may be

780
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,679
completely wrong it has no protocol

781
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,440
identifiers you have a

782
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,480
udp

783
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,799
header so that the protocol is the

784
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,918
reserved port number

785
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,159
yeah apparently nobody here is a quick

786
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,559
expert

787
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,880
i would say that we check and we discuss

788
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,760
this on the mailing list

789
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,120
specific point let's do that sounds good

790
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,880
on

791
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,039
the other side of the question is

792
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,120
if the etr supports more than one

793
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,880
variable transfer

794
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,760
typically tcp and quick

795
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,039
how does it know which one to use

796
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,559
the authors of the graph are leaning

797
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,240
towards leaving this and implementation

798
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,600
choice

799
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,919
so that if you support two you could

800
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,320
potentially pro four four for those two

801
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,960
and and pick whichever server replies or

802
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,640
whichever you you like if it replies the

803
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,679
two

804
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,960
um

805
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,720
i don't know if anyone has

806
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,679
any specific opinion on on this i i have

807
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,240
a comment on this i do agree this could

808
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
be a

809
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,559
an implementation choice the fact that

810
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,600
you don't

811
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
necessarily

812
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,600
need to implement tcp

813
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,080
you don't need to use quick

814
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,000
as long as you have the basic which is

815
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,399
udp

816
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,000
now

817
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,600
how do i signal

818
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
that i can do more than udp this goes to

819
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,960
the periphery slide if there is the

820
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,320
reliable transport beat it does not tell

821
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,840
me whether i should use tcp or quick

822
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,519
it does not so probably sound too pro

823
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,279
or or you you use one bit per different

824
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,080
transport you have a t-bit for the tcp

825
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,320
you have a qubit for the

826
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,080
quantum bit not a quick bit

827
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,600
it's a suggestion i mean this may be

828
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,840
uh i i can send an email on the mailing

829
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,159
list so that we discuss this point

830
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,159
um yeah that's that's that's fine yeah

831
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,440
um

832
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,720
i guess that we're not gonna see a reset

833
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,559
transport protocols

834
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,760
well we don't have zillions of transport

835
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,080
protocols

836
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,440
so i

837
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
i i i don't think we we're going to

838
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,320
waste so many beats

839
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,600
okay

840
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,960
i think that's a good discussion for the

841
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,360
mailing list

842
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,559
is something to be bonded somehow okay

843
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,840
um

844
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,399
okay that's it

845
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,240
oh no no there is a very final question

846
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,039
sorry yeah yeah working group adoption

847
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,320
are we

848
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,720
fine is there anyone that wants to say

849
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,159
something before we call for a working

850
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,360
group foundation of the document have

851
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,080
been

852
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,919
sitting as an individual draft for too

853
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,760
long i think and and it's becoming more

854
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,279
and more relevant

855
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,199
uh

856
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,760
i have one one final comments just on

857
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,399
the content in general on

858
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,839
the document these are about the

859
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,440
security part i don't remember how is

860
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
um

861
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
dealt with and just came up to my mind i

862
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,918
mean if we use tcp me we may want to use

863
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,639
tls in order to secure the communication

864
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,440
i mean

865
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,079
if if we push this document forward it's

866
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,800
like lipsec i mean we

867
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,119
there will be a thorough security review

868
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,280
so we we have to make sure that it goes

869
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,760
through doesn't mean that we need

870
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,599
this to be done before adoption to be

871
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,719
clear

872
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,599
okay

873
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,800
but uh i i would put it as a

874
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,040
action item that we check whatever

875
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
should be done i don't i don't remember

876
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,280
to be honest

877
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,960
yeah yeah so

878
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,359
otherwise we we got stuck somewhere else

879
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,040
along the path we just

880
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,000
we know how it works

881
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,160
you're right that the security reviews

882
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,760
may point to that so

883
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,720
yeah okay okay good as for the adoption

884
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,200
uh i don't think there is any issue we

885
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,480
can we can call for adoption here now

886
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,400
and then check on the mailing list as

887
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,000
usual okay so we'll try to use the the

888
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,800
amazing tool that

889
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,280
uh that we have here for to check for

890
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,960
adoption this

891
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,400
so

892
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,640
if you agree that this document is

893
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,800
worthwhile and should be adopted we work

894
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,560
and we solve all the issues that have

895
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,720
been discussed right now you go on the

896
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,920
mythical

897
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,440
and you are raise your hand

898
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,280
for for people in the room and

899
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,280
remotely

900
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,079
i will close it now

901
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,599
and uh we we have a clear consensus i

902
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,079
mean i'm not sure this was it to read it

903
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,599
but uh

904
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,920
and ninety percent or more of the people

905
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,320
arise there that participated in the

906
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,800
poll lies at their hands so i guess

907
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,359
at this stage uh we go

908
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,400
check on the mailing list

909
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
and the next

910
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,079
no we concluded

911
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,599
this part

912
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,320
quick question on the poll

913
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,560
um that's assuming

914
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,520
yeah this is dino um it assumes that the

915
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,000
if we go the reliable transport uh

916
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,720
document goes working group document

917
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,800
that the best documents don't reference

918
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,599
it

919
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,280
or otherwise

920
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,400
we have another dependency correct

921
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,280
uh anyway the busy arguments are already

922
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,520
there and out we we

923
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,720
we fix any issue that is rised during

924
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,000
the itafe review or the different area

925
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,640
review or the isg review but

926
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,480
there is no reference there uh there is

927
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
no reference as far as i remember

928
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,320
yeah and you're not and you're not

929
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,119
proposing to put a reference there right

930
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,839
yeah yeah yeah no no no no no no no no

931
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,440
no right okay good i just want to

932
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,480
clarify okay okay okay

933
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,720
okay thank you a bit so

934
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,959
better

935
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,240
it's weird

936
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,880
i feel uncomfortable to read all the

937
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,599
the details and it's not consensus rough

938
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,480
consensus anyway sorry bernard go ahead

939
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,119
so thank you my name is bennett handle

940
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,280
first time at the itf and i'll give you

941
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,560
a short update

942
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,320
on the draft handle

943
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,200
this ground-based

944
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,560
rfc

945
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,640
uh about the mobility and multi-link

946
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,000
solution for safety critical

947
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,320
communication aviation it's a specific

948
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,839
use case for lisp

949
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,640
in in this domain the next slide please

950
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,480
and the search structure i want to give

951
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,200
you an overview about the the the lisp

952
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,320
scope

953
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,240
in in this specific solution and the

954
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,920
concept and

955
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,599
uh how we we using lisp to to

956
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,280
to provide multi-link

957
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,520
usage and the local policy overwriting

958
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,599
if you have multiple

959
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,599
routing

960
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,079
links to the aircraft

961
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,359
and i want to conclude with with some

962
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,680
standardization requests

963
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,839
for this idea troop so next slide please

964
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,599
so the ground-based lisp soap we are

965
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,359
mainly working here

966
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,200
for safety critical communication in

967
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
aviation and the ground-based lift

968
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,160
solution

969
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,079
is implementing one mobility and

970
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,440
multi-link

971
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,240
uh solution for this um safety grid

972
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,480
communication aviation and we're mainly

973
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,920
standardizing this on ako

974
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,839
this system enables the aircraft and the

975
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:00,880
ground

976
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,200
applications and hosts

977
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,320
to use

978
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,160
multiple air ground

979
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
access networks during all phases of

980
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,640
flight it distributes all the relevant

981
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
information

982
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,280
to the mobility and multi-link decision

983
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,960
elements which you will just explain

984
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,560
that in the next slide

985
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,599
on ground and in the airport ips system

986
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,640
so one specific protocol

987
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,280
we're using um

988
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,520
for exchanging information between the

989
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,839
aircraft and the ground it's called the

990
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,920
air ground mobility interface protocol

991
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,480
that's a domain specific protocol

992
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,800
and we will only specify this in iko and

993
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,480
it's not

994
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,960
uh focus here in itf and we're not

995
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,359
planning to to standardize

996
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,800
this here

997
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,920
and we are using lisp here mainly to

998
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,160
distribute all the information

999
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,920
uh from this uh acme proxy to the egg

1000
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,079
that's located in the access networks to

1001
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,400
the to the ground ground border routers

1002
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,720
which are lisp xdr

1003
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,280
routers um and

1004
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,839
this ground ground border routers

1005
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,200
uh the multi-link policy enforcement

1006
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,599
points for the uplink traffic

1007
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,839
i think this will be more clear in the

1008
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,240
next slide when you see the architecture

1009
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,680
things

1010
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,119
next slide please

1011
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,640
so here we see the reference topology

1012
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,880
it's subdivided in four segments on the

1013
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,000
left side

1014
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,880
you see the the aircraft segment

1015
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,680
where we have an 810 ips system

1016
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
and we have here

1017
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,079
a downlink decision and enforcement

1018
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,319
point and the aircraft is typically

1019
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,280
connected to multiple

1020
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,680
via different radio access technologies

1021
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,119
to multiple

1022
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,880
so-called airground

1023
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,800
communication service providers this

1024
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,960
could be either satellite providers like

1025
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,800
emails after iridium

1026
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,640
or terrestrial based

1027
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,520
providers like medial mode 2 the current

1028
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,280
existing one or the ldac so these are

1029
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,480
very

1030
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,160
domain specific

1031
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,560
radio access technologies

1032
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,839
um

1033
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,560
you see here the next segment is the

1034
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,920
airground

1035
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,920
um

1036
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,000
excess network segment where we have

1037
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,800
this acme with the main specific

1038
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,119
protocol end point on ground

1039
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,040
the end point in the aircraft is sitting

1040
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,160
in the in dayton ips system and with

1041
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,000
this domain specific protocol we're

1042
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,079
exchanging all the information

1043
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,560
to the acme ground proxy which then

1044
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,040
forwards this to the next segment which

1045
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,640
is the lisp segment

1046
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,720
and that that's right called ground

1047
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,040
based since all the lisp elements are

1048
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,960
located here on ground there's an

1049
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,800
alternative proposal where all the lisp

1050
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,640
elements located in the aircraft

1051
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,319
and finally uh the last segment is then

1052
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,280
the operator and the user segments

1053
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,680
that's mainly nsb so air navigation

1054
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,480
service providers like fva or not

1055
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,680
or airlines like lufthansa or

1056
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,160
british airways and so on

1057
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,520
you see here all the appropriations

1058
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,359
we are using one important i want to

1059
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,640
mention

1060
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,359
the mmb the mobile network prefix

1061
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,119
so this is

1062
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,560
a unique

1063
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,599
globally unique

1064
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:24,160
ipv6 prefix administratively assigned

1065
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,119
to an aircraft so which the aircraft is

1066
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,960
using for communication

1067
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,880
during all the uh phases of flight

1068
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,440
and this is uh 60 ip version 6 prefix

1069
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,599
which is

1070
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,880
used from the ip version 6 area that is

1071
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,800
iko asking

1072
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,359
from epic

1073
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,839
address space so next slide please

1074
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,599
thanks so

1075
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,920
a few words about the concept

1076
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,000
so typically the aircraft starts with

1077
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,480
attaching to one or more of this

1078
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,040
airground access networks mainly by

1079
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,920
using specific radio access technology

1080
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,599
specific

1081
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,640
means

1082
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,800
it needs typically to authenticate to

1083
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,520
the to the access network

1084
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,720
and then the access network uh forwards

1085
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,920
typically

1086
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,240
that announces that this mobile network

1087
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,480
prefix is reachable over the specific

1088
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,040
airground access network and that sorry

1089
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,160
the the e in remote they ask to you you

1090
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,240
speak closer to the mic

1091
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,440
otherwise they don't hear you sorry

1092
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,839
sorry

1093
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,400
um so then

1094
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,480
the aircraft it advertises the

1095
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,920
reachability

1096
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,640
by by

1097
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,960
by sending the mobile network prefix to

1098
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,920
the

1099
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,839
to the access network and for that it

1100
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,599
using the this

1101
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,240
already mentioned acme protocol in

1102
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,040
addition where the acme protocol

1103
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,480
we also

1104
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,760
um

1105
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,079
exchange information like

1106
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:06,839
uh

1107
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,960
then the link status and some

1108
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,160
specific traffic scope traffic scope

1109
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,280
here

1110
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,480
um summarized by a sub mmp

1111
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,560
so a sub network of the mobile network

1112
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,319
prefix

1113
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,880
and with this the aircraft is able to

1114
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,280
announce routing preferences to the

1115
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,400
ground for the acting uplink traffic

1116
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,920
meaning which

1117
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,880
which

1118
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,520
link the aircraft

1119
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,839
recommends for uplink traffic for a

1120
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,720
specific traffic scope

1121
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,119
so what in addition

1122
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,240
as an extended acme information

1123
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,520
there is some need for sending 4d to

1124
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,480
trajectories to the ground meaning the

1125
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,319
current position of the aircraft with

1126
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,000
the timestamp

1127
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,880
that's

1128
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,520
for some users

1129
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,640
needful to to use this for a policy

1130
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,480
decision on the uplink

1131
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,440
traffic and then it and some users need

1132
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,839
also a digital signature from the

1133
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,920
aircraft so that they can verify the

1134
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,800
identity and the integrity

1135
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,480
of the information that is forwarded

1136
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,319
so

1137
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,640
this information then is sent to the

1138
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,280
acme ground proxy and the acme ground

1139
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,920
proxy we're currently using a

1140
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,400
northbound interface to forwarding this

1141
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,960
and mapping this information to the lisp

1142
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,599
control plane mapping the preferences to

1143
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,200
list priorities

1144
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,160
and

1145
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,040
this

1146
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
can be used by the ground ground router

1147
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,960
so the list peaks they are

1148
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,200
on the other side to getting all the

1149
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,560
preferences

1150
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,280
and can can use this preference for

1151
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,000
uplink routing decisions

1152
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,760
for that we're using the pubs up

1153
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,079
mechanism that means the ground ground

1154
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,000
router subscribes to the mmp

1155
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,800
to this mobile network prefix and it

1156
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
should also automatically subscribe with

1157
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,079
this to all the sub prefixes

1158
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,160
in this example we have two sub prefixes

1159
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,760
a1 and a2

1160
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,400
and i think in the next slide explaining

1161
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,079
how this will be used

1162
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,960
so next slide please

1163
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
so this is the multilink usage that

1164
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,359
means the preferences are sent down and

1165
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,800
in this example

1166
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,760
the aircraft sending a preference for

1167
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,079
for the sub network a1

1168
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,920
should be using the upper

1169
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,960
the lower the green one the lower axis

1170
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,480
network and the sub

1171
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,240
prefix a2

1172
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,079
should use the the upper access network

1173
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,040
and the decision in point

1174
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,520
is the ground ground router so

1175
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,440
it receives all the preferences the

1176
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,560
mappings

1177
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,400
from the eid so the mobile network

1178
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,520
prefix and all the sub mmps the sub

1179
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,720
networks

1180
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,040
at the cache in the cache of the ground

1181
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,520
ground router and it using this to make

1182
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,800
the decision

1183
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,359
that the a1 traffic should be forwarded

1184
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,280
over the

1185
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,119
airground xsb

1186
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,200
and then

1187
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,880
day two traffic should be forwarded over

1188
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,040
the axis network a

1189
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,599
so that's mainly the multilink that we

1190
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,680
uh how we're using

1191
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,680
a lisp for for

1192
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,079
for a multi-link scenario

1193
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,480
and so the next slide you have three

1194
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,440
minutes

1195
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,359
left

1196
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,400
thank you

1197
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,839
so the uplink local policy is a use case

1198
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,160
i mentioned already there are some users

1199
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,359
they're using this only as a

1200
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,920
recommendation and to want to use

1201
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,200
additional information to overwrite this

1202
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,680
that means in that example

1203
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,160
the local policy writing day two traffic

1204
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,520
it should also go over the access

1205
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,800
network so that means we need for this

1206
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,520
but this a policy decision point

1207
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,800
uh which is located somewhere in the in

1208
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,960
the in the atso domain

1209
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,520
and with this it reads out

1210
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,000
the preferences from the

1211
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,839
coming from the aircraft

1212
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:12,720
and

1213
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,800
is able to override this

1214
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,760
by by the local policies and for that

1215
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,720
information doing so we need

1216
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,720
some additional information

1217
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,200
that just results in the last slide it's

1218
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,280
the next one thank you

1219
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,240
so this is what we are requesting

1220
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,280
from the uh our support from the

1221
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,920
from the itf from the list working group

1222
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,400
the most important point is that

1223
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,920
we need

1224
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,520
in our domain

1225
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
standards for the lisp control and data

1226
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,119
blame protocol

1227
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,640
so the lack of these standards is

1228
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,800
currently the major risk for our

1229
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,119
ground-based lisp solution so that's an

1230
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,559
absolute must so that the rc 6830 and

1231
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,400
6833

1232
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,400
should go on the standard track without

1233
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,559
that it's very difficult for us

1234
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,839
to use this uh that pops up

1235
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,960
publish subscribe functionality for lisp

1236
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,079
we

1237
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,319
we would ask if you can move this from

1238
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,359
the experimental to the standard track

1239
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,559
in

1240
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,800
addition because we are using the pub

1241
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,280
sub functionality for the mobility

1242
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,920
in addition we we asking for some

1243
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,559
additional clarifications and functions

1244
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,359
like a selective subscription operation

1245
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,359
and what happens after d request

1246
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,760
registration explicit selective

1247
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,359
unsubscription and so on so a few items

1248
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,960
we we

1249
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,480
would like to

1250
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,800
have some clarifications and some

1251
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,640
discussions on that

1252
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,280
we asking for a network mobility support

1253
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,559
so that means

1254
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,200
there is perhaps a flag that shows that

1255
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,280
this is a mobile network

1256
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,520
and we could not automatically remove

1257
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,720
all longer sub prefixes as you have seen

1258
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,280
we're using sub prefixes

1259
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,040
for traffic scoping

1260
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,200
and this would help inside the mapping

1261
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,319
system

1262
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,640
to deregister

1263
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,079
or remove

1264
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,559
longer sub prefixes

1265
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,400
we want to include the network ability

1266
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,480
feature to draft

1267
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,440
to the draft etf list be a demobility

1268
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,720
proposal

1269
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,960
that's something that would help us

1270
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,720
to refer to this

1271
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,079
and finally

1272
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:24,960
some

1273
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,880
thing that would also help us to

1274
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,640
transport more information instead of

1275
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,960
lisp i mentioned the 4d trajectory

1276
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,839
snapshot digital signatures should be

1277
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,440
forwarded from the aircraft over the

1278
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
acme

1279
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,520
to the ground ground router over the

1280
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,839
lisp control plane so if there existing

1281
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,319
a mechanism to allowing that

1282
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,640
that would help to use lisp for that

1283
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,040
otherwise we have to use an alternative

1284
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
solution for that

1285
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,559
and

1286
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,480
we would also like to get an advice from

1287
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,200
you if you're either giving this in a

1288
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,839
specific change requests to the

1289
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,839
to the to the itf to the list by deaf

1290
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,319
working group or an alternative approach

1291
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,960
we could create an experimental ifc

1292
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,200
for multi-link mobility that more or

1293
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,800
less describes

1294
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,359
the needed the additional needed

1295
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,960
additional needs

1296
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,480
and we referencing to the all the other

1297
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,359
uh rfcs generic pops up and mobility

1298
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,200
rushes so whatever is the better process

1299
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,640
yeah

1300
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,559
thank you

1301
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,400
yeah that concludes my presentation

1302
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,880
thank you yeah this is albert akavedo

1303
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,160
thanks for your presentation i think

1304
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,319
it's a very interesting use case and

1305
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,240
also thanks for the for this slide i

1306
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,520
think it's super clear what you're

1307
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,520
asking and that's always something which

1308
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,720
is good

1309
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,280
i'm curious about the well the first

1310
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,960
bullet point i cannot comment maybe

1311
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,040
which you can comment i think it is what

1312
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,800
it is and the last one i don't have any

1313
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,960
opinion either but regarding the public

1314
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,400
subscribe could you

1315
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,480
elaborate a little bit further on the

1316
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,240
selective subscribe

1317
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,000
and explicit selective and subscription

1318
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,359
and wildcard

1319
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,680
i don't understand that

1320
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,160
subscribe wins we we we subscribing only

1321
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,240
for one or for a number of specific

1322
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,240
multiple network prefix for a number of

1323
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,920
specific eids

1324
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,400
not for all okay we want to do a list of

1325
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,440
eig's we want to subscribe okay so not a

1326
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,400
prefix but slash 32s inside that perfect

1327
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,319
right for example yeah with the wildcard

1328
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,960
32 40 42.

1329
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,839
okay and then uh the digital signature i

1330
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,599
don't understand it either

1331
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,000
yeah the digital signature is something

1332
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,960
that some users on ground would like to

1333
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,960
verify if there come preferences from

1334
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,480
the aircraft to the ground how the

1335
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,400
uplink traffic should should be sent

1336
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,640
that this is forwarded over the acme

1337
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,359
over the lisp domain to the to the faa

1338
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,359
for example to the absolute domain and

1339
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,440
they want to verify that this message

1340
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,359
comes originally from the aircraft that

1341
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,200
means it's

1342
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,440
signed digitally signed and this should

1343
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,800
be forwarded over all the different

1344
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,640
protocols currently we're doing this

1345
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,800
over the domain-specific acme but there

1346
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
is no way to forward this over lisp it

1347
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,599
would help us if we have a specific part

1348
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,480
of lisp where we can use a specific data

1349
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,800
forwarding user-specific data

1350
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,480
over the mapping system to all the

1351
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,680
extras okay but that's just yeah

1352
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,640
it would

1353
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,640
make it simpler for us

1354
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,640
uh otherwise we need an alternative

1355
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,720
protocol yeah i understand yeah thank

1356
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,400
you so much i better you have one

1357
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,040
sentence and we move forward

1358
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,680
i think we support most of that let's

1359
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,359
discuss after the

1360
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,440
meeting yep thank you

1361
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,280
on the requirements i would say you send

1362
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,119
an email to the mailing list

1363
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,839
with with what is needed for you so that

1364
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,480
the discussion takes place there as well

1365
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,400
sharon okay thanks thank you

1366
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,599
okay so the main purpose of this

1367
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,599
discussion now is there is no change to

1368
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,200
the

1369
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,200
rfc draft list next to a network

1370
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,480
hexagons

1371
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,119
uh it's in the viral queue

1372
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,640
but uh there is a lot of progress in the

1373
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,920
industry

1374
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,720
uh which i want to update you and

1375
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,559
experience we're getting by deploying

1376
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,119
with multiple carriers in japan in the

1377
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,160
us

1378
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,800
with aws wavelength

1379
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,040
um so basically

1380
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,920
sorry this thing doesn't the listener is

1381
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,200
not something on its own it fits to

1382
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,960
industry consulting work

1383
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,599
in the auto edge industry

1384
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,359
which aims to unify what is termed vtv

1385
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,040
or vehicle-to-vehicle

1386
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,640
architecture where vehicles tell each

1387
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,119
other about immediate problems

1388
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,400
which doesn't work

1389
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,119
and v2c which is an aggregation into the

1390
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,240
cloud

1391
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,079
by all vehicles

1392
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,599
overnight

1393
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,119
takes a few days

1394
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,839
so we are able to unify

1395
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,640
with

1396
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,079
the immediacy uh and programmability

1397
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,400
the immediacy of b2v the probability of

1398
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,799
vehicle to cloud but eliminating the

1399
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,760
ability impossibility of v2v

1400
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,160
every car gets multiple points of view

1401
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,400
over the same things from

1402
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,160
beyond life on site

1403
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,040
which is a big problem and the lag of

1404
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,839
the cloud using one architecture the

1405
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,520
question is why

1406
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,520
sharon you need to stay close to the mic

1407
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,960
we can't hear you

1408
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,280
you need to stay right

1409
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,799
sorry sorry

1410
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,200
the question is was over launched so why

1411
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,839
do we tie this whole structure with

1412
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,839
application routing

1413
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,200
and not with kafka and database queues

1414
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,599
and all these mechanisms and let me try

1415
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:38,559
to

1416
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,079
clarify that so

1417
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,680
try to do it as quickly as i can so

1418
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,599
first of all the volume

1419
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,599
if you're talking about a city of a

1420
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,680
million active vehicles like paris la

1421
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,400
and i want to use um 10

1422
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,559
of their vehicles to sample what's going

1423
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,160
on for double parking hazards blockades

1424
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,319
sudden stops

1425
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,839
things like that

1426
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:04,319
then i'm talking about in any given

1427
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,440
second

1428
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,559
um

1429
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,359
10 of the vehicles are sampling they're

1430
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,400
moving at 30 meters per second they need

1431
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,079
10 frames

1432
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,880
per second in order to capture a point

1433
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,319
of interest that means a million frames

1434
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,559
per second for the city

1435
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,880
and half a terabit okay

1436
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,440
these are have to be processed

1437
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,319
by gpus the best case for gpus is a

1438
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,559
thousand frames per second that means i

1439
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:33,920
have to really distribute between

1440
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,640
multiple sites in the city

1441
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,839
that's routing that's not a kafka job

1442
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,440
and

1443
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,319
then i have to consolidate

1444
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:47,119
this amount of traffic in the city so i

1445
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,520
can upload just the exceptions

1446
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,440
and changes to the cloud using one

1447
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,160
gigabit links okay

1448
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,839
on the downstream next

1449
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:58,480
time

1450
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,720
on the downstream if i have a million

1451
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,040
vehicles that over the next second are

1452
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,520
going to be in 10 tiles

1453
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,599
depending on the traffic pattern and i

1454
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,839
have a thousand

1455
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,559
active events in the city of people

1456
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,160
unloading loading

1457
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,119
making offenses jaywalking

1458
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,599
affecting a hundred tires each

1459
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,160
that every second i have to calculate a

1460
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,200
joint

1461
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,520
over a million vehicles times a thousand

1462
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,760
events at a billion times a thousand

1463
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,160
times it's a trillion that's impossible

1464
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,480
to do the only way to do it

1465
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,480
is using feeds

1466
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,400
which are already

1467
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,480
pre-joined

1468
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,480
multicast fields and scenario

1469
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,160
application uh

1470
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,160
multicast feeds

1471
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,480
uh that scales really well

1472
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,720
all right so that's why application

1473
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,000
routing

1474
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,160
it relates to a lot of the discussions

1475
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,160
these ideas

1476
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,040
what do we get we get something like um

1477
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,440
an air traffic control for the city

1478
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,440
so just like in air defense missile

1479
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,040
defense i

1480
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,920
uh separate the space into

1481
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,160
zones so to know what's going on in real

1482
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,200
time

1483
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,200
that's what i'm doing on the road

1484
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,000
using crowdsource this is improving the

1485
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,319
driver experience but really

1486
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,040
looking forward to the near future

1487
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,319
that's the only way to scale av density

1488
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,079
not to get avs

1489
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,160
into situations which are hard to get

1490
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,319
out of because then i can gridlock the

1491
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,119
city when the number of avs goes up and

1492
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,920
also reduce the cost of an avr i cannot

1493
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,920
have a 10 000 car with a ten thousand

1494
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,680
dollar computer so that's what we're

1495
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,680
after

1496
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,520
slide down

1497
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,359
the way we do it is you know that

1498
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,839
already from the draft we use an eid

1499
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,839
space to divide the earth pre-divide the

1500
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:50,799
problem into

1501
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:53,760
eid and hexagons and we use the crowd to

1502
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,079
post data and process them in the next

1503
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,359
account so this is familiar

1504
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,839
uh there is a nice animation here of a

1505
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:04,480
car driving you can check it out offline

1506
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,079
we cannot do it here

1507
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,119
but the rtrs are steering

1508
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,079
the uploads to the hexagons

1509
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,160
where all the uploads for a given

1510
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,520
location

1511
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,799
are being processed and consolidated

1512
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,839
sorry

1513
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:22,640
yeah

1514
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,079
next slide

1515
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,079
that's the upstream on the downstream

1516
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,880
what you can see is once a detection

1517
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,680
a change an exception was detected

1518
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,720
there is a notification from the eid

1519
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,160
to the rtr and to the rtr in the cloud

1520
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,720
replication is done by the rtr this

1521
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,440
scales the multi-billion john

1522
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,079
next

1523
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,839
this is uh trying

1524
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,720
multiple providers there's a lot of uh

1525
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,960
edge providers in the game right now

1526
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,920
also amazon but it's not the only game

1527
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,359
like in cloud

1528
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,640
uh the oems have uh

1529
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,880
computational facilities in the city

1530
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,200
other companies and this is a trial

1531
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,319
going on in

1532
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,799
japan there is a deployment in new york

1533
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,880
and there's a big trial going on in

1534
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
nevada with

1535
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,240
with aws next

1536
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,440
okay so

1537
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,440
just to understand

1538
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,040
what does application routing solve here

1539
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,640
list

1540
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,799
so in a cloud situation

1541
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:29,119
i load balance

1542
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,920
clients between servers

1543
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,480
okay because it's all shared

1544
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,960
uh storage

1545
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,760
in an edge situation like this

1546
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,359
i cannot load balance the clients

1547
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,760
these clients have to be in this service

1548
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,440
these clients have to be in this service

1549
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,359
because there the service is the

1550
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:52,000
location has to consolidate

1551
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,799
so

1552
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,880
what i have to do is solve a bunch of

1553
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,599
issues using application route

1554
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,839
so i am instead of balancing clients on

1555
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:00,880
services

1556
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,440
i'm balancing services on servers i'm

1557
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,839
moving servers around based on

1558
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,040
activity

1559
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,920
okay

1560
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,480
and that is solved by the lisp

1561
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,839
interaction

1562
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:15,040
i have a problem of geoprivacy

1563
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,440
associating with a service

1564
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,520
means that if i'm uh subscribed to a

1565
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,359
parking service the parking service

1566
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,920
providers knows where i am all day long

1567
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,520
that's impossible

1568
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,680
um

1569
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,359
when i'm driving between location i'm

1570
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,160
changing context that's a dns

1571
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,760
multi-second

1572
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,760
break in the service that's uh

1573
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,640
unacceptable this is all that and if i'm

1574
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,559
changing carriers i'm changing my

1575
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,040
identities and that's unacceptable and

1576
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,280
they saw that

1577
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,240
sharon we are out of time okay

1578
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,520
so

1579
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,960
just uh

1580
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,400
a few two sides or three slides

1581
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,319
so let's solve all these problems next

1582
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,359
okay

1583
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:01,839
if i put this in the mac

1584
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,599
then i have a terabit per second from

1585
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,200
the mobile core

1586
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,400
split into using um metro ethernet to

1587
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,839
the local zones

1588
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,760
and solving the capacity problem well

1589
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,079
next

1590
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,880
i'm solving the queuing problem if i

1591
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,000
have

1592
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,839
a q per vehicle at 5 megabits per second

1593
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:25,520
10 microseconds 10 milliseconds a way

1594
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,280
and i optimize the queuing from the

1595
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,000
uplink using rtrs i cannot bring

1596
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
processing to the mech there's no space

1597
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,240
and the rtr are able to solve that

1598
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,920
problem and the high availability

1599
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,799
problem

1600
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,119
next

1601
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,680
and downstream the joint problem we

1602
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,359
talked about

1603
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,359
next

1604
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,039
it's really important to understand that

1605
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,680
this is just one piece of this industry

1606
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,440
specification

1607
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,920
but it's the connector between

1608
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,880
auto edge and 3gpp why

1609
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,960
because 3gpp interface is to an

1610
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,880
application server there is no

1611
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,640
application server for the distributed

1612
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,119
edge application application routing is

1613
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,960
the application server

1614
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,200
okay

1615
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,720
that's it

1616
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,640
okay thank you very much uh shadow no

1617
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,960
i'm sorry but we don't have time for

1618
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,920
question

1619
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,720
uh

1620
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,359
i thank everybody i say goodbye take

1621
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:24,240
care

1622
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,880
see you again in philly online remote

1623
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,599
we'll see okay

1624
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,038
i

1625
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,000
he was stuck with other documents that

1626
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,039
apparently were very huge

1627
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:09,119
so he promised me

1628
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,359
to start look at the list document

1629
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,880
what happens he has to review the

1630
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,680
documents and

1631
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:23,960
show then
