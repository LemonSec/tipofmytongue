1
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,199
so i'm conscious that uh it's now half

2
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,240
past

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,680
two in vienna

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,520
uh half past whatever the hour is

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
wherever you are so uh i think that's

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,039
probably our cue to kick off ed are you

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,119
alive and well

8
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,840
yeah

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,559
excellent so um welcome everyone uh

10
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,520

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,079
ietf113dtn working group uh what we

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,760

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,440
has joined us to

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,879
say a few words about the operation of

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,000
the ipn sig and his opinions on state of

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,160
play of dtm so what i'm going to do is

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,760
going to run through these chair slides

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,160
pretty promptly

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,800
because vince on a bit of a timeline and

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,079
then we can get straight on to him and

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,760
then get on with the regular working

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,039
group business so um as this is an ietf

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,720

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,760

before and have not read the note well i

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,880
strongly recommend you go away and do it

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,240
in your own uh time it covers ipr

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,600
behavior the fact that you are uh waving

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,400
your rights to restrict uh it gives us

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,439
the rights to record for posterity the

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,280
any comment you may make at microphone

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
and if you turn on your camera etc

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,240
uh the bcps which cover this in detail

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,079
are detailed on this slide please reach

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,280
out to the chairs the ad or anyone else

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
within an all-time idea it can point you

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,240
at the actual material

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,360
uh because this is the first fully uh

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,759
hybrid i would say post covid but i

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,799
think that might be a little bit

43
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,240
ambitious meeting um there is an

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,640
in-person participant tool as well as a

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,479
remote participant tool this is to keep

46
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,799
meet echo operating well between those

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,399
who are set in the room and those of us

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,439
like myself dialed in uh if you we're

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,840
operating a single mic queue so if you

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,280
have questions please download the uh

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,000
meet echo lite onsite tool

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
onto your phone i think it's all done as

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
a web browser

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,720
and that should allow you to join the

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,040
queue correctly and we can manage a

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
single queue without hopefully too much

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
disruption it's been working well so far

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,560
uh so yeah if you are on site please

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,080
keep your audio and video off otherwise

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,760
we get terrible feedback loops remote

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,519
participants it's just like it's been

62
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,319
for the last two years so um just

63
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,480
operate the meat echo website

64
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,000
as as

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you always have done

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
so uh here is a little bit of uh

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
boilerplate just in terms of the main

68
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
agenda for our atf-113 is here we'll

69
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
cover the working group agenda in a

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,040
minute uh meet echo further information

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,879
is also here the irony being that i'm

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,480
displaying this through meet echo so if

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
you can't see this how do you see the

74
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,680
url but hey

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,599
and if you need any technical uh

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,599
assistance there's a dedicated issues

77
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,959
page

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,319
if you are stuck in the room and none of

79
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
this is working i suggest tapping the

80
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
shoulder of the person next to you

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,879
maintaining covet distancing and ask

82
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,560
them for help and they can hopefully

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,239
show you a smartphone with some kind of

84
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,599
url i'll point you in the direction

85
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
someone who can help

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,040
so agenda

87
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,840
we

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,879
uh this is the admins

89
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,640
administrator from the chairs a quick

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,319
five minutes just to cover where we are

91
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,680
and what we're doing

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,080
uh and then we've got uh vint kindly for

93
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,720
25 minutes and then we're kind of into

94
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,159
the meat of new charter items updates on

95
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,319
existing documents and

96
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,920
ed and i both have a couple of questions

97
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,200
to put to the working group which we've

98
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,440
done as a set of slides

99
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,360
which we'll squeeze in at the end we've

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,959
got quite a packed schedule so we've

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,120
only got five minutes for open mic

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
so you'll have to excuse the fact that

103
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,040
i'm speaking quite fast and clicking

104
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,760
buttons quite quickly

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,599
administrative so there is an integrated

106
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
note-taking tool it was called codemd

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but i believe mitocho have moved to a

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,319
different tool it's markdown based it's

109
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,439
interactive our secretary adam is

110
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,480
currently

111
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
hopefully logged into it i haven't

112
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,959
checked please help him get

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,120
the minutes correct particularly around

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
your name which is always difficult to

115
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
grab off the mic

116
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,720
and just double check if you're making

117
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,240
comments that it's been captured

118
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
correctly and and your point was was

119
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
correctly documented and if you're just

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,680
feeling generous please help us out

121
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
keeping those minutes an accurate record

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,199
for for posterity

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,840
as usual the the mailing list is dtn at

124
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
itf.org

125
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,880
that's where the main business of the

126
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,199
working group happens so long drawn out

127
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,840
conversations we will point at the list

128
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,320
and please subscribe monitor and

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,240
contribute on the list would be great if

130
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
you want to contact the chairs it's dtm

131
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,720
hyphen chairs ietf.org that's a great

132
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,440
place for procedural questions

133
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,360
if you start asking us technicalities we

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,960
will probably redirect you back to the

135
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,479
list and continue the conversation there

136
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,759
in public

137
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,520
um

138
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,919
one thing i did want to add after

139
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,320
ietf112

140
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,280
was

141
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,039
we did discuss our recharge that

142
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,880
rechartering has happened i recommend

143
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,960
people to look at the new charter page

144
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,759
for the dtn working group it is as was

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,280
agreed at

146
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
the previous itf meeting we've had the

147
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,199
sign off from the iab

148
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,520
it's fully approved and we can move

149
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
ahead with the topics we wanted

150
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,759
and also most important

151
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,840
we have four rfcs so the

152
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,520
last four six years of hard work

153
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,639
updating bundle protocol tcpcl bp sec

154
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,600
uh default security context around ppsec

155
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
are now a nice set of rfcs so well done

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,440
the working group that nicely bookends

157
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,800
the previous

158
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,919
epic amount of work we put in and

159
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,240
allows us to start a new chapter really

160
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,360
from this meeting onwards looking at uh

161
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,440
the next steps for the dtm working group

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,319
and i think that loans unless ed has

163
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,840
anything to say do you want to jump in

164
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,759
no that was a wonderful introduction i

165
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,600
just wanted to say congratulations for

166
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,520
getting those first four rfcs done and

167
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
we're looking forward to the work well

168
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,199
that's more charter

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,759

would like to repeat that

181
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,240
congratulations this this working group

182
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
it has been nice working with with this

183
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,800
and recharging went really well and

184
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,160
thanks to the chairs and thanks to the

185
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,039
authors to the 48 who has put a lot of

186
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,759
effort to get things right so

187
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,680
vent after you

188

then we can see your speaker notes

190
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,840
rather than your screen just

191
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,719
for reference

192
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,599
and i think you're on mute

193

need to do to get it to show the full

198
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,840
screen

199
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
it seems to have grabbed the wrong

200
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,120
window

201
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,440

to invade the meeting i haven't been a

216
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,839
participant in the dtn working group

217
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,640
and

218
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
so i actually appreciate your tolerance

second congratulations on all the

220
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,279
progress that you've made

221
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,440
and third

222
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,080
we you have many many folks around the

223
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,560
world who are very very uh excited about

224
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
the work you're doing the work you will

225
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,800
do with under the new charter and the

226
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,600
opportunity to demonstrate for

227
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,279
many others of the efficacy of the

228
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,440
standardization that you've already

229
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,720
accomplished

230
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,080
so

231
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,360
i we are i am representing in this talk

232
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
the interplanetary networking special

233
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,959
interest group which will is in the

234
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,519
process of becoming the interplanetary

235
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,279
networking chapter of the internet

236
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,399
society

237
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,480
uh the special interest group was formed

238
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
in 1998

239
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
and it was parallel to the work that

240
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,920
began at the jet propulsion lab and has

241
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,279
now expanded

242
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,959
to a wide range of

243
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,839
uh nasa laboratories as well as other

244
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,399
space fairing agencies like issa and

245
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,920
jaxa and others

246
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
so

247
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
the

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,640
effort over the past what now almost 24

249
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,760
years

250
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,480
has yielded a great deal of output

251
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,040
including all the work that you've done

252
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,880
so the ipn sig group uh is as a small

253
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,560
board uh yosuko kaneko is the chair he's

254
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
also

255
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,800
a

256
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,519
senior member of jaxa scott burleigh is

257
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,920
the vice chair uh and has recently

258
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,279
retired from

259
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,360
the jet propulsion lab but is still

260
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,680
extremely active as you all know

261
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,079
in dtn matters mike snell is the

262
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,720
secretary treasurer and has uh served

263
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,040
the ipm sig for many years i'm just a

264
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
member of the board

265
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,800
oscar garcia who's present today in the

266
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,680
call

267
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,399
is

268
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,360
also the chair of our projects working

269
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,959
group and extremely active in

270
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,399
implementing uh both the dtn protocols

271
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,880
and also applications that go on top of

272
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,600
them as is alberto montia and keith

273
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
scott all of you know is uh extremely

274
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,600
active at mitre

275
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,120
and then the ccsds

276
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
program

277
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,800
for standardization of the

278
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,560
bundle protocols

279
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,320
we have over 800 members scattered i

280
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,519
won't say exactly uniformly but not

281
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,839
not too uniformly around the world which

282
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,480
is very satisfying there's a lot of

283
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,160
interest in the work that you're doing

284
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,959
and and in the prospects of

285
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,360
interplanetary networking

286
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,760
the ipn cig has created a number of

287
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,399
working groups in order to progress

288
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,480
its efforts the strategy working group

289
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,760
produced a report in 2021

290
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,120
uh which

291
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,279
is available on the website

292
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,519
and it looks to the next hundred years

293
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,839
of evolution of the interplanetary

294
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,000
backbone network there's a projects

295
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,240
working group led by oscar garcia and

296
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
it's actively

297
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,920
implementing and testing

298
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,639
the protocols and i'll come to to that

299
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,320
in the next slide there's an

300
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
architecture and governance working

301
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
group which is asking the question

302
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,519
what does this look like as it

303
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,399
begins to evolve as we leave

304
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
planet earth and we begin to build an

305
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,720
interplanetary backbone

306
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,399
what are the terms and conditions for

307
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,560
operation one of their multiple parties

308
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,000
who are implementing pieces of the

309
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
interplanetary backbone what are the

310
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
rules by which uh

311
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,120
the

312
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,519
entire operation functions

313
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,079
and uh as we ex

314
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,600
extend our human operation

315
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
beyond planet earth

316
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,560
exactly what does jurisdiction look like

317
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,360
what are the rules of the game

318
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
for uh

319
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
for operating

320
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,800
in space so this is uh still uh more or

321
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,959
less uh i'm sorry i'm being distracted

322
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,240
by the fact that there are a bunch of

323
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,120
guys hanging uh on the side of the

324
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,000
building cleaning my window

325
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,720
there's nothing more slightly uh you

326
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
know weird feeling i'm on the 16th floor

327
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,240
of the building and there are people who

328
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,600
are watching this presentation

329
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,480
uh there is a library um

330
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,800
which is accumulating a great deal of

331
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,720
information about interplanetary

332
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,680
networking and i urge you to have a look

333
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,000
and also to contribute

334
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,200
to that of course all the work of the

335
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,120
dtm working group will show up in the

336
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,360
library there's an outreach working

337
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,760
group which is intended to

338
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,399
draw the attention of the general public

339
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,639
to the uh work that you do the work that

340
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,079
the ipm state is doing and ccsds in

341
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,279
order to

342
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,320
stimulate interest in space exploration

343
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,199
and also the commercialization of space

344
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,040
speaking of which the last working group

345
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
is is a business working group which is

346
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,560
trying to understand what will be the

347
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
way in which commercialization of space

348
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,279
unfolds and many of you who are watching

349
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,760
the return to the moon will know that

350
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
there are for-profit companies spacex

351
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,760
and many others that are quite

352
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,320
interested in um

353
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
what it might mean to operate in a

354
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,560
commercial sense

355
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,079
off earth

356
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,800
ranging from mining on the moon to

357
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,839
manufacturing in zero gravity to

358
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,519
entertainment and

359
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,720
travel

360
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,639
all of those things are

361
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,079
possible and we are i think at the cusp

362
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,079
of that change

363
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,360
as we see

364
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,240
companies like spacex and others

365
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
blue origins

366
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,519
beginning to explore the possibility of

367
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,000
i would say popular space travel

368
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,079
and so i think all of you might look at

369
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,639
2022 as a

370
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,839
kind of a

371
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,120
a knee in the curve of possibilities

372
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,320
or

373
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,120
we're making use of space travel

374
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,000
uh their strategy report is uh mentioned

375
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,680
in the last uh

376
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,600
line here of this slide

377
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
and i draw your attention to it because

378
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,920
it's our attempt to summarize what might

379
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
happen over the past over the next 100

380
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,040
years or so

381
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,079
here are our intentions at least as i

382
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,959
interpret them as the interplanetary

383
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,040
networking special interest group

384
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
the first one is to implement and test a

385
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,600
terrestrial and low earth orbiting

386
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
network based on the dtm protocols that

387
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,839
you standardized and the idea here is to

388
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,920
make sure that people can see that this

389
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,399
actually works that it's a reliable

390
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,680
robust uh and resilient system

391
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,160
we want to assure ourselves that the

392
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,399
technology the implementation of the

393
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,079
technology is

394
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,199
solid

395
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,959
before we start sending things off

396
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,199
planet to distant locations because it's

397
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,360
harder to fix things remotely than it is

398
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,839
to fix them while we're still

399
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,320
in a terrestrial operation

400
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,920
so this is partly to

401
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,480
persuade ourselves and others that we

402
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,839
have a scalable and operational system

403
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,360
in particular

404
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,120
we're very interested in assuring that

405
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,519
the network management and security and

406
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,839
configuration features of the design are

407
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,600
actually implemented

408
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,199
effectively and can be used easily

409
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,040
by anyone building a piece of this

410
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,120
interplanetary backbone

411
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,720
i'm sure all of you

412
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,800
by this time appreciate the network

413
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,680
management in a highly varied delay

414
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,759
and potentially disrupted environment

415
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,000
does not look like

416
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,839
the network management that we've come

417
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,399
to know in the terrestrial internet ping

418
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,639
is not your friend in the interplanetary

419
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,240
environment

420
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,399
we're interested in showing

421
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,199
that

422
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,519
these protocols are capable of

423
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,839
supporting useful applications and so

424
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,160
we'll be testing messaging and real-time

425
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,240
video and federated artificial

426
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
intelligence and machine learning

427
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,959
among a number of other applications and

428
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,799
we encourage all of you

429
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,880
as you think about possible ways of

430
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,480
using the protocols that you've

431
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,559
standardized to

432
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,439
inject those ideas into ipm sig as well

433
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,599
one thing that's uh i believe pretty

434
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,160
clear to all of us is that there will be

435
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
multiple parties operating pieces of the

436
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
interplanetary backbone in the same way

437
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
that there are many parties operating

438
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,720
pieces of the terrestrial internet

439
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,880
and so we're going to have to make sure

440
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,120
that a multi-network

441
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,000
uh construct actually works well that

442
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,160
the independently operated but

443
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,840
cooperating portions of the

444
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,480
interplanetary backbone can actually uh

445
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,720
interwork in the same

446
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,799
fashion that the terrestrial internet

447
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,520
has uh has demonstrated and so that's a

448
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,240
very important uh

449
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,679
issue to resolve and finally uh on this

450
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
line anyway we also need to make sure

451
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,440
that various implementations of the

452
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,000
bundle protocol will interwork uh

453
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
successfully

454
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,000
so that's another opportunity for us to

455
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,559
demonstrate the quality of the of the

456
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,160
work that you've done

457
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,039
we are expecting to collaborate with a

458
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,960
wide range of different parties the

459
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,520
project working group involves about 20

460
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,840
or 30 people as oscar garcia can tell

461
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,320
you who are all working on various and

462
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,640
sundry demonstrations of the

463
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,559
of the technology uh the you uh nasa of

464
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,120
course has a dtn working group and they

465
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,600
are parallel to the work that you do and

466
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,679
they're busy uh implementing the

467
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,760
protocols and testing them in a variety

468
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
of environments including the

469
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,919
international space station and looking

470
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,480
forward to uh the return to the moon

471
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,600
lunanet

472
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,640
at nasa moonlight at esa among others

473
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,760
uh are

474
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,080
programs that are being undertaken by

475
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,200
the space agencies in the return to the

476
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,280
moon and of course we expect the dtn

477
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,160
protocols to be a part of all of that

478
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
at utica college there's a very active

479
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
engagement in the implementation and

480
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,280
test of the protocols as well as uh el

481
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,440
modio who is also present at this

482
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,480
meeting

483
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,240
who has a testing laboratory and i've

484
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,640
left out a number of other players and i

485
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,120
apologize if if i didn't include you in

486
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,000
this list i just want to make sure that

487
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,400
all of you appreciate that there is

488
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,880
significant and growing interest

489
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,120
uh in the in the work that you've

490
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,360
already accomplished to say nothing of

491
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
what you're going to do in this newly

492
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,960
chartered period

493
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
i mentioned earlier that

494
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,160
the commercialization of space and the

495
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,880
departure from from earth

496
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,039
creates all kinds of really interesting

497
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,120
questions about the governance

498
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,039
of um

499
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
of operation in space not just of the

500
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
interplanetary backbone network but all

501
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
the other ancillary things that one

502
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,440
could imagine whether it's mining on the

503
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,320
moon or space laboratories uh you know

504
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,679
habitations

505
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,320
uh on mars you know as we look further

506
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,120
out into the future the question is how

507
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,679
is that all going to work and it's not

508
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,480
obvious now one thing that i can tell

509
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,679
you is that

510
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,559
in the

511
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,760
artemis

512
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,679
return to the moon missions

513
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,520
a substantial amount of work on

514
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,440
governance was undertaken in what's

515
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,919
called the artemis accords

516
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,720
which are adjunct to the many space

517
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,600
treaties that have already been agreed

518
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,799
in the past the artemis accords

519
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,679
take a fairly broad look at uh what it

520
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,919
will be like to function

521
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,760
uh in on the moon uh with multiple

522
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,799
national and private sector entities all

523
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,360
interacting with each other exactly what

524
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
does that jurisdiction look like how

525
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
will disputes be um

526
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,280
resolved if there are any what does it

527
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,600
mean to own private property on the moon

528
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
how do we fence off historical sites

529
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,720
like the

530
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
landing uh the july

531
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,200
landing in 1969

532
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,919
uh among other sites and of course uh

533
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,960
extending that to sites on mars and uh

534
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,679
and other planets and uh and moons of

535
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,200
our solar system

536
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
so this governance framework discussion

537
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,440
is bound to

538
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,320
get off into a variety of weeds and it

539
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,360
does require substantial attention in

540
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,760
order to make sure that we can operate

541
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,400
in space in a in a friendly

542
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
and cooperative way and finally um this

543
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,679
is the last slide and also the last

544
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,400
bullet point uh we're very interested in

545
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,480
drawing public attention to

546
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
the work that you're doing and the

547
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,159
notion of an interplanetary backbone and

548
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,960
so we're looking at if you remember

549
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,559
the search for extraterrestrial

550
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,480
intelligence seti at home

551
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,559
allowed people to download an app that

552
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,200
would take in radio signal

553
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,600
received digitized radio signals to look

554
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
for irregularities

555
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
we'd like to do is build an

556
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,960
ssi solar system internet at home

557
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,000
to allow people to help us exercise a

558
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,720
terrestrial implementation of the bungle

559
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,640
protocol system

560
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,520
in order to test its ability to scale up

561
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,720
uh and to manage uh various and sundry

562
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,880
you know failure modes to identify and

563
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
recover from them

564
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,000
so there is a very uh significant uh

565
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,520
agenda that the ipn sig has adopted and

566
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
i hope that many of you

567
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
who are already

568
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,280
planning on standardization work will

569
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,840
join us in implementation test and

570
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,679
demonstration as well

571
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,919
so i'm going to stop there let's see if

572
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,520
i can stop sharing

573
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,120
my slides

574
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,919
and

575
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,240
return to uh

576
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,200
to the

577
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,480
meeting

578
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,559
and thank you for the time i didn't take

579
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,200
20 minutes or 25 minutes and i think

580
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,880
that that's good because you have so

581
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,640
much work to do that giving you back a

582
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,480
little bit of time seems like it's a

583
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
good thing

584
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
and you've had enough of it surf anyway

585
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
so i'll stop there and

586
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,559
i have a few minutes before i have to go

587
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,159
to do something else if there are

588
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,360
questions

589
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,640
or

590
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,320
observations that any of you want to

591
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,799
make or corrections if i've misstated

592
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,200
anything

593
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,919
so if if we don't have someone uh sort

594
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,760
of coming up to the my task of the

595
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,840
specific questions uh the one i would

596
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,000
have is i i look at the audience

597
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,320
participation uh here the the number of

598
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,880
folks we have which is higher than uh we

599
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,960
typically have and so that says to me

600
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,799
that we may have a few people here who

601
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,679
are

602
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,000
new to dtn as a set of technologies new

603
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,919
to the bundle protocol

604
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,360
as as

605
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,440
as the mind behind the initial uh

606
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,600
intention for standardizing store and

607
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,360
forward could you give just a couple of

608
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,880
sentences to those who may not be

609
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,520
familiar with bundle protocol on why

610
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,360
this is the protocol for doing this kind

611
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,039
of activity

612
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,440
uh well i'm happy to do that

613
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,039
many of you will

614
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,480
perhaps remember that in 1997

615
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,240
a pathfinder

616
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,640
robot vehicle was landed on mars

617
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,679
successfully after 20 years of failure

618
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,400
the previous success was 1976 with the

619
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,640
two viking landers and then nothing

620
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,240
worked for a long time so there was

621
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,159
great celebration that we finally got

622
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,760
back to mars

623
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,559
uh

624
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,880
with a successful landing

625
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,679
uh

626
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,760
the following spring at the jet

627
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,159
propulsion lab i went out to meet the

628
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,760
team that was responsible for the

629
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,320
communications support for that

630
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,919
pathfinder

631
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,279
project

632
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,600
and we asked ourselves then what should

633
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,799
we be doing now that is to say in 1998

634
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,760
that might be needed 25 years later

635
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,000
and we came to the conclusion that we

636
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,480
should think about an internet for the

637
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,039
solar system in order to support demand

638
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,039
and robotic space exploration and of

639
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,480
course from today's perspective also to

640
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,039
support commercialization of space

641
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,840
so we said well can't we use tcp it

642
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
works okay on earth why wouldn't it work

643
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,600
on mars and the answer is well it will

644
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,039
work on mars

645
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,600
however we started doing the math

646
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,400
for interplanetary distances

647
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,960
and discovered very quickly the tcp with

648
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
a 40-minute round-trip time has a lot of

649
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,640
trouble with flow control

650
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,000
so we decided it was time to rethink

651
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,120
this very different parametric space

652
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,360
recent protocols needed in this very

653
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,760
different parametric space and we began

654
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,159
to design the bundle protocols and as

655
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,679
all of you know we've been through now

656
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,320
seven iterations of the bungle protocol

657
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,720
design hopefully this one

658
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,240
will be stable

659
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,039
and we can now stick with implementing

660
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,080
and

661
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,440
reinforcing

662
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,520
and standardizing it

663
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,200
but you can tell

664
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,880
that the speed of light is simply too

665
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,200
slow and we can complain to mr einstein

666
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,640
about this

667
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,720
but nobody's found any way to fix that

668
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,679
so

669
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
we've had to adapt our protocols to

670
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,080
accommodate not only the variable delay

671
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,360
which is significant but also disruption

672
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,559
caused by

673
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,200
orbital dynamics and planetary rotation

674
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,919
which we don't know how to stop either

675
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,520
so um

676
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,919
that's what led to the work that you are

677
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,000
now presently engaged in

678
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,480
uh and it's uh it's actually been a lot

679
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,600
of fun to be forced to rethink

680
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,400
uh

681
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,640
uh networking protocols in a different

682
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,200
context

683
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
brilliant thank you thank you ven um

684
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,840
zahed you've got a question in the queue

685
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,080
hello i hope you can hear me right

686
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,799
yeah so first of all thank thank vin for

687
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,679
being here with us and sharing this

688
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,039
really exciting

689
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,360
ideas and agendas i mean this this this

690
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,039
looks really cool um uh so i think i

691
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,960
have two questions to you and not really

692
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,440
about this old technology one one was

693
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,240
like

694
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,000
um

695
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,279
for for this itf working group um and we

696
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,880
have reached our day i don't know like

697
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,520
if you have seen that when we're more

698
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
looking towards the addressing and how

699
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,600
to reach things and maintenance and

700
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,039
stuff like that do you have any

701
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,640
particular

702
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,960
suggestion or like an expectation from

703
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
this working group

704
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,679
that

705
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,600
that we can take on with us

706
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,320
as you are here

707
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,399
i'm sorry i didn't i are you asking

708
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,880
about a solution to ad

709
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,200
no i'm thinking i'm actually more likely

710
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,320
what do you think what is your

711
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,240
expectation and what is this ip6

712
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,399
expectation from the dtn working group

713
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,360
in itunes oh oh oh well well first of

714
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,200
all of course we want you to

715
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,080
continue to refine the protocols and

716
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,799
take and to take into account

717
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,840
that not only do we have to deal with

718
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,600
these highly variable delays and

719
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,520
disruption but we also want this to work

720
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,880
in real time

721
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,120
so if for cases where we actually have

722
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,039
low latency

723
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,799
i would like to be able to do streaming

724
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,679
video like we're doing right this moment

725
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,679
i'd like to be able to build

726
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,000
applications that will

727
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,760
function reliably in the same way that

728
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,600
they function in the present day

729
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,399
internet

730
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,240
is just that the

731
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,360
architecture has to include the entire

732
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,919
range of delay and disruption

733
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,919
and so when it when we have low latency

734
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,279
everything should work pretty much the

735
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,120
way tcpip does

736
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
but yeah when we don't have low latency

737
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,720
it has to work

738
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,279
in the way that we intend with the dtn

739
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,279
so that's one thing the second thing i

740
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,840
think is that we'd like very much to see

741
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,720
more energy put into applications

742
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,520
uh to understand

743
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,120
what it means to build a delight

744
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,520
tolerant application

745
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,840
and finally uh i mean among many other

746
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,200
things i i'd like to exercise the naming

747
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,440
and addressing structures

748
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,679
in order to regularize them and come to

749
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,440
agreement about how that should be

750
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,679
managed as you all know we have in the

751
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,679
internet the iana the internet design

752
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,399
numbers authority and on the ccsds side

753
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,480
we have senna

754
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,799
and i'm hoping that that will be a

755
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,840
parallel operation that we can rely on

756
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,679
and finally commercialization you should

757
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,080
be thinking what does this mean

758
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,000
to use this stuff

759
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,760
in this mixed environment where you have

760
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,440
government investment in government

761
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,960
operations and we have commercial

762
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,679
operations how does that actually work

763
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,679
and can we make it work in the same

764
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,000
successful way that we have in the

765
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,120
internet on earth

766
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,679
yeah thanks thanks for this i think uh

767
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,520
from your what your expectation from

768
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,360
this working was like i think we're

769
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,640
already dealing couple of things the

770
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,080
addressing thing the maintenance things

771
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,000
that the configuration part of it i

772
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,679
think this this is great and the real

773
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,120
time thing i think we then we need to

774
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,159
have engage a bit broader itf community

775
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,240
to that one like what because we already

776
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,320
have some established protocols for

777
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,480
those kind of use cases and bringing the

778
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,159
boundary protocol and the same kind of

779
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,799
thing might be a bit like we need to

780
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,960
think a bit more holistic way of looking

781
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
at it and see like how this fits into

782
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
current architecture but i think the

783
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,880
point you made like getting the

784
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,960
architecture uh this electron

785
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,360
architecture into the into the so-called

786
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
internal way of doing things it'd be a

787
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,960
nice combination to look on so thanks

788
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
for those words and thanks thanks for

789
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,240
being here

790
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
well thank you all very much i do need

791
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,640
to go off to another meeting but i wish

792
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
you well and the rest of this one

793
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,039
and certainly again thank you for all

794
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,799
the work that you're doing because it's

795
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,919
enabled

796
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,720
us

797
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
uh to be uh

798
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,279
active in promoting the interplanetary

799
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,559
backbone work that your efforts support

800
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,360
so

801
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
i'll bid you adieu safe journey thank

802
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,200
you very much vint

803
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,240
thank you and uh yes run run if you i

804
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,840
know you've got a hard stop so thank you

805
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,039
very much

806
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,200
thanks so much

807
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,120
thanks

808
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,200
so uh just as i i joined the cube

809
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,679
briefly because we i have a presentation

810
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,440
at the very end of of the agenda for

811
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,240
this meeting covering um

812
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,840
two of the points been raised about uh

813
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,240
naming and addressing and some of some

814
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,000
early steps forwards which would allow

815
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,279
some applicability within the

816
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,519
terrestrial internet so for those of you

817
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,960
who can bear it now that vinta's

818
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,679
finished please stay until the end um

819
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,519
because we're going to cover some topics

820
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,279
there which which should open things and

821
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,919
in the rest of our agenda is equally as

822
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,240
interesting but a big thank you for vint

823
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,799
in retrospect for uh for speaking so ed

824
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,120
i'm going to hand over to you because i

825
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,919
have spoken a lot

826
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,919
oh no that that's totally fine but i i

827
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,760
think that now in the interest of time

828
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,120
we should go into our agenda items my my

829
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,440
understanding uh is that

830
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,399
we are going to present slides uh for

831
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,039
our presenters and manage them so that

832
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,360
uh individual presenters don't need to

833
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,039
share their screen and otherwise go

834
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,880
through their clients is that correct

835
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,039
so uh the latest version of meet echo

836
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,640
has the ability to share slides

837
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,519
centrally and to effectively pass the

838
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,159
next slide please functionality to the

839
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,679
individual presenter so they'll get a

840
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,120
little strip appears at the bottom of

841
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,039
the slide deck in their window and they

842
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,279
can click forwards and back so

843
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,399
scott i will pass the slide control for

844
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,000
this slide deck

845
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,360
and you should see within your meet echo

846
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,279
that you now have a little strip across

847
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,960
the bottom of the presentation view

848
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,159
which allows you to step through the

849
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,200
slides

850
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,679
how elegant uh can you hear me

851
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,840
yes we can hello scott

852
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,399
hi all right well let's let's start then

853
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,960
um and i'll try to get through this in

854
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,240
25 minutes um uh i've got two

855
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
presentations here one on bundle bundle

856
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,159
encapsulation one on quality of service

857
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,640
which are a couple of the items that are

858
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,440
in the new charter uh the uh bundle

859
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,760
model encapsulation presentation

860
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,320
actually is a very little change from

861
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,600
the one i gave in spring of 2021 this is

862
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,480
uh

863
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,120
to refresh everyone's mind on

864
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,360
uh what this is about and uh and to

865
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,159
introduce it to anybody who

866
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,240
missed the earlier presentation on it i

867
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,679
think this is a

868
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,320
an important um

869
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,840
technological feature for uh

870
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,799
for deploying a useful delay tolerant

871
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,919
networks in the future so um i i think

872
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,519
it's worth spending a little bit of time

873
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,320
on

874
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,360
um

875
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,240
is this gonna work

876
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,480
okay good i'm gonna slide two all right

877
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,240
uh the overview of the presentation i'll

878
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,640
give a short history of uh

879
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,600
vibe

880
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,000
uh and uh talk about

881
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,279
custody signaling in that context the

882
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,159
current

883
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,519
uh vibe design and uh

884
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,760
possible applications and then just a

885
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,559
note on the future use of the thing

886
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,760
um

887
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,559
you know short history

888
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,600
uh

889
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,120
uh vibe actually goes back to 2009. uh

890
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,480
some of our colleagues at mitre

891
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,639
corporation put together this uh

892
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,719
internet draft um

893
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,520
in uh august of that year and the idea

894
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,918
at that point was that uh one bundle

895
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,359
encapsulation would be a

896
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:21,918
a bundle protocol application now the

897
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,239
basic idea of five is that you use one

898
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,280
protocol

899
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,520
to send uh bundles um that is the the

900
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,440
the payload of

901
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,359
a

902
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,960
bundle is another bundle um it's

903
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,320
tunneling

904
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,639
and the same kinds of advantages of

905
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,839
tumbling in

906
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,839
in the internet uh applied to

907
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,679
um a bundle model encapsulation in in

908
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,918
dtn the specific motivations uh cited in

909
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,320
in in that original draft were uh

910
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,480
support for for content centric

911
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,400
networking uh forwarding cash bundles um

912
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,800
targeted custodial retransmission of

913
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,280
multicast bundles which was

914
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,920
an open problem at that time and

915
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
security in particular

916
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,480
defense against traffic analysis

917
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,599
which

918
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,880
nothing else that we were looking at at

919
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,160
the time

920
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,520
would provide

921
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,759
um

922
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,599
we were busy with a lot of other things

923
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,280
so bob never really went anywhere um for

924
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,200
the ensuing four years

925
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,560
um and

926
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,240
and i picked it up again

927
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,320
in 2013 um but with a slightly different

928
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,640
um

929
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,760
organization that is instead of being uh

930
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,040
instead of looking at vibe as an

931
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,359
application on top of bundle protocol

932
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,520
um i think it's important to look at it

933
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,599
as a convergence layer protocol

934
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,760
underneath on the protocol so it

935
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,200
you know still have bundles and bundles

936
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,520
it's a question of

937
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,359
where you you

938
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,240
stack them in the stack and and in

939
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,440
particular the idea at that time was

940
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,320
um

941
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,640
we were trying to disentangle routing

942
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,560
from security there were problems with

943
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,119
the original

944
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,720
security protocol for for bundle

945
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,359
protocol and in particular it was like

946
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,240
really

947
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,359
locked into

948
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,040
this notion of security sources and

949
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,680
security destinations that

950
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,079
made it possible for security to get in

951
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,599
the way of

952
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,320
effective routing and this is a a

953
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,480
mechanism for for getting around that if

954
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,040
we wanted to preserve the specific

955
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,119
security source and security destination

956
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,640
features

957
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,040
um

958
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,800
at the same time there was a lot of

959
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,640
discussion of custody transfer in 2015

960
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,400
2016.

961
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,839
in particular there were a couple of

962
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,400
things that were discovered that

963
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,160
what made it just not work that is

964
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,560
custody transfer as in funnel protocol

965
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
version 6 had

966
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,920
two

967
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
significant problems one was

968
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
that

969
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,280
the retransmission depended on accurate

970
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,200
uh estimation of round trip time so that

971
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,680
you could know when to retransmit and

972
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,359
the general case that was not possible

973
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,960
because

974
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,680
you didn't know who was going to be the

975
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,240
recipient and from and therefore from

976
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,560
whom you should expect a custody signal

977
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,720
so you had no way of knowing

978
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
when to expect that signal and

979
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,200
when to determine that it was late uh

980
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,320
another uh serious problem was that the

981
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,960
bundle fragmentation by non-custodians

982
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,280
which is perfectly okay

983
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,880
couldn't be prevented and it would

984
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,200
defeat custody transfer because the

985
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,079
uh uh anything that took custody of

986
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,599
of the

987
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,880
fragments

988
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,720
those custody signals would not match up

989
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,800
with any bundle that

990
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,240
any current custodian had had custody of

991
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,200
uh

992
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
at the same time though

993
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,200
there were scenarios especially

994
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,040
um scenarios in involving unidirectional

995
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,720
links where

996
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,240
uh some sort of

997
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,839
delay tolerant asymmetric

998
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,760
acknowledgement system is going to be

999
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,640
needed uh and bundle protocol is an

1000
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,440
obvious uh mechanism for delay tolerant

1001
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,000
asymmetric acknowledgement so why not

1002
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,359
use it for

1003
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,839
custody transfer

1004
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,920
so um

1005
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,640
the the concept uh

1006
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,000
that that emerged was that uh

1007
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,320
and i'll i will put this as a

1008
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,839
as a proposition that um bundle protocol

1009
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,680
transmission reliability is something

1010
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,240
that needs to be accomplished uh between

1011
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,320
neighboring protocol nodes it needs to

1012
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,079
be accomplished at the convergence layer

1013
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,200
because

1014
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,480
of the same problems that

1015
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,119
custodial re-transmission um

1016
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,040
um

1017
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,000
ran into in in bbv6

1018
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,880
uh

1019
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,200
in in that sense if custody transfer is

1020
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,240
gonna happen

1021
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,079
at uh as a reliable transmission

1022
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,240
mechanism that it needs to happen at the

1023
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,400
convergence layer so you should use

1024
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,480
bundle protocol as a as a convergence

1025
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,800
their protocol and of course hang on

1026
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,520
blibe is already doing that so why not

1027
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,960
just add

1028
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,359
uh custodial re-transmission as a a

1029
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,839
feature of vibe so that vibe would

1030
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,920
do uh two things

1031
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,480
independently or or concurrently

1032
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,280
um across domain security with sources

1033
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,920
and destinations and giving us a defense

1034
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,640
against traffic analysis and also

1035
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
reliable convergence theory transmission

1036
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,760
over asymmetric path

1037
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
um

1038
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,119
separately from all of this

1039
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,599
back in 2012 there were researchers at

1040
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,000
the university of colorado boulder that

1041
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
had designed a

1042
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,640
more bandwidth efficient definition of

1043
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,960
bpv6 custom transfer

1044
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,040
it was documented in an internet draft

1045
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,880
that actually never got posted

1046
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,839
um

1047
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:58,640
uh

1048
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,960
sebastian kuzminski and uh andrew

1049
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,760
jenkins at uc boulder were the

1050
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,359
developers and it was very effective uh

1051
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,560
it was developed as a as a prototype and

1052
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,119
implemented as an option in the

1053
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,880
interplanetary overlay network

1054
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
implementation of dtm

1055
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,680
and

1056
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,520
uh and has been in use in um

1057
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,440
in operational

1058
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,880
transmission from the international

1059
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,560
space station for

1060
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,240
um

1061
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,920
about five years now and and very well

1062
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,040
received

1063
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,720
uh it's been highly successful in

1064
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,960
operations the user community likes it a

1065
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,880
lot and so

1066
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,760
uh

1067
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,280
if if we if we take this uh aggregated

1068
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,440
custodial signaling concept and use that

1069
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,160
as

1070
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,079
as

1071
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,920
the implementation of

1072
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
of the custody transfer idea

1073
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,760
in

1074
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,720
a

1075
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,560
bundle of bundle encapsulation the

1076
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,640
result is this uh draft that was posted

1077
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,520
in

1078
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,440
may of 2018

1079
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,960
and has been sort of sitting there

1080
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,240
waiting for somebody to do something

1081
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,440
with it since then

1082
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,400
what you end up with is

1083
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,319
aggregate custody signaling as an

1084
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,760
optionally

1085
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,560
reliable convergence layer protocol

1086
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
underneath bundle protocol

1087
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,359
and the encapsulated bundle

1088
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,760
could can be encrypted and or assigned

1089
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,920
and providing additional

1090
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,839
security features that

1091
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,119
bpsec itself does not

1092
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,200
um

1093
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,480
so um

1094
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,119
here's the the

1095
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,200
single slide sort of laying it all out

1096
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,720
the payload of the encapsulating bundle

1097
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,760
comprises a transmission id which is

1098
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,359
used for uh

1099
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,759
linking

1100
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,560
custom signals back to the bundles that

1101
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,000
are being acknowledged

1102
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,079
uh the expected time of acknowledgment

1103
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,480
for that bundle and and that's

1104
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,040
important for for signaling

1105
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
to the recipient

1106
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,440
when to um

1107
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,400
wrap up the advocate uh custody signal

1108
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,200
and send it back so so that it'll arrive

1109
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,400
in time to

1110
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,000
um

1111
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,760
to

1112
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,240
turn off the re-transmission timers for

1113
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,040
the

1114
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,839
bundles that are being uh acknowledged

1115
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,079
and then the encapsulated bundle

1116
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,160
the acknowledgement itself

1117
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,040
uh

1118
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,440
is um an aggregate um structure that

1119
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,560
is uh

1120
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,200
conveyed in a new administrative record

1121
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,760
that is sent you know in a bundle that

1122
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,880
responds to the the uh

1123
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,480
bundles themselves

1124
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,400
and it includes a

1125
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,200
custody transfer disposition code

1126
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,520
such as it's a reason code essentially

1127
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,240
and then sequences of of consecutive

1128
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,680
transmission ids overseas bundles

1129
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,200
if the acknowledgement is not received

1130
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,440
by the expected time then transmission

1131
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,680
of the encapsulated bundle is assumed to

1132
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,280
have failed and the encapsulated bundle

1133
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
is uh re

1134
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,520
queued for reform

1135
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,480
um

1136
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
something that that uh

1137
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,920
came up in in discussion of this with um

1138
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,400
uh with goddard space life center quite

1139
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,079
recently is what if

1140
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,400
one or both of the participating nodes

1141
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,720
don't have accurate clocks uh we have

1142
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,760
the

1143
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,880
um

1144
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,400
bundle lifetime

1145
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,720
mechanism uh

1146
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,240
provided for for for operations of

1147
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,960
you know at the bundle protocol but what

1148
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,880
about bundle model encapsulation is this

1149
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,000
going to be an expected time of

1150
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,440
acknowledgment how is that going to be

1151
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,599
expressed so that that needs to be

1152
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,640
addressed

1153
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,359
in

1154
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,040
the next

1155
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,720
edition of

1156
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,119
of this internet draft

1157
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,400
uh some some mechanism that enables the

1158
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,119
sender to say here's when i expect

1159
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,440
um an acknowledgement and and for the

1160
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,079
receiver to understand that and

1161
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,839
and use that as a

1162
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,760
trigger for sending the acknowledgement

1163
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,160
uh aggregated

1164
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,879
signals back

1165
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,000
uh

1166
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,280
okay uh given all of that i'll very

1167
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,720
briefly run over a couple of the

1168
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,520
applications for this technology and

1169
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,560
then

1170
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,640
move on to the next presentation and

1171
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,160
maybe take questions for everything at

1172
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,599
the end

1173
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,359
um

1174
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,800
i think that bundled bundle

1175
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,880
encapsulation actually

1176
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,119
is kind of if you set your mind to

1177
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,800
thinking about it there are

1178
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,319
a a a number of weird kinds of scenarios

1179
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,839
that uh vibe might be helpful for

1180
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,680
here's the the one that

1181
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,599
the the nominal

1182
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,359
mechanism that

1183
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,640
we use uh

1184
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,160
before which is uh custodial reliability

1185
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,000
now that custody transfer has been

1186
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,800
removed from bundle protocol we still

1187
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,160
want to have it

1188
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,119
here's a place for it to be and here's a

1189
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,520
pictorial representation of how that

1190
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,880
would work

1191
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,240
um

1192
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,400
uh similarly across domain uh security

1193
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,599
um

1194
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,920
it may be that uh for

1195
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,040
large parts of the end-to-end path

1196
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
uh the bundle doesn't uh need any

1197
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,280
particular security and and then it it

1198
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,640
needs to to cross a danger zone and in

1199
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,280
across that danger zone you encapsulate

1200
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,839
the original

1201
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,480
um uh

1202
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,319
uh unencrypted

1203
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,040
bundle as the payload of

1204
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,079
of a protected bundle an armored bundle

1205
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,200
that

1206
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,599
crosses the no man's land

1207
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,040
um

1208
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,839
defense against traffic analysis if you

1209
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,599
um

1210
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,359
even if the the

1211
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,800
original bundle is uh safely encrypted

1212
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,160
you may still want nobody to know

1213
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,160
where it's going to where it ultimately

1214
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,319
comes from and you can do that by

1215
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,440
um

1216
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,960
encapsulating it uh in

1217
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,079
in in a

1218
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,079
bundle between

1219
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:10,960
two

1220
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,800
well-known uh

1221
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,560
points of the network

1222
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,200
and and the the final destination is not

1223
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,520
revealed until the bundle reaches

1224
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,760
uh a safe part of the network

1225
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,880
um

1226
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,839
uh but that sort of transientness

1227
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,200
of security can be extended to

1228
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,119
entrantness of quality of service it may

1229
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,440
be that the bundle doesn't need any

1230
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,240
particular quality of service mechanism

1231
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,720
applied to it while it's

1232
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,000
in um

1233
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,119
local subnets but across the the trunk

1234
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,160
line of

1235
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,640
of the network it it

1236
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,960
it needs some sort of special markings

1237
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,359
so that it's handled in a

1238
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,359
responsible way and the that sort of

1239
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,680
quality of service marking can be done

1240
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,119
uh with bundled bottle encapsulation

1241
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,960
um

1242
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,800
again the the transientness of

1243
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,079
of vibe

1244
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,520
is um helpful for things like um

1245
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,760
critical forwarding that is uh one of

1246
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,599
the features of

1247
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,160
the expanded extended class of service

1248
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,000
mechanism developed for ebb six is this

1249
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,960
critical

1250
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,079
uh bundle idea that

1251
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,040
ensures that the bundle has got the

1252
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,880
greatest possible chance of getting to

1253
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,960
its destination well maybe it doesn't

1254
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,160
need

1255
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,440
all of that is additional sort of

1256
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,400
multicasting and

1257
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,640
multi-copying for for all of its and

1258
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,960
path but maybe for part of the the

1259
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,119
journey it does and a way to do that is

1260
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,079
to

1261
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,680
encapsulate it

1262
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,680
encapsulate the original bundle in a in

1263
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,000
a critical bundle and that critical

1264
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,880
bundle

1265
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,319
you're sort of guaranteed is going to

1266
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,480
make it to the to the far end of the

1267
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,119
danger zone and then the original bundle

1268
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,960
uh can be removed from that and

1269
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,359
multicast in the same way maybe only

1270
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,880
uh

1271
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,280
part of the network

1272
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,280
needs to care about multicasting enough

1273
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,800
in in a way to ensure that that

1274
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,960
the bundle reaches its destination by

1275
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,920
sending forward multiple copies

1276
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,880
um

1277
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,640
source path routing uh is a a

1278
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,599
sort of bizarre but actually potentially

1279
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,480
useful uh thing you can do with

1280
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,480
with a bundle of bundle encapsulation

1281
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,480
just encapsulating multiple layers that

1282
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,880
will sort of guarantee that

1283
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,720
the

1284
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,400
the point-to-point

1285
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,440
uh transmission of the bundle along a

1286
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,599
specific sequence of

1287
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,680
uh forwarding elements

1288
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,720
um and combinations of these things

1289
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,040
certified multicastle you know there are

1290
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,720
a number of weird things that

1291
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,960
that that you can do with unfunded

1292
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,559
encapsulation and still be well within

1293
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:11,920
the

1294
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,640
the the rules and the

1295
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,559
guard rails of

1296
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,359
a responsible bundle transmission

1297
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,230
um all right so uh let's um

1298
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,680
[Music]

1299
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,440
switch over to the other

1300
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,440
presentation and i'll try to knit

1301
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,760
through it quickly

1302
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,040
sorry scott do you want to take

1303
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,119
questions on this now or

1304
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,520
i i i can't if there are some

1305
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,400
that are

1306
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,960
ready right away uh i wanted to make

1307
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,319
sure to get through everything and not

1308
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,960
hold everybody up so um

1309
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,200
okay i have one very quick question on

1310
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,000
that sorry uh on about slide 12 or

1311
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,240
something you said something about

1312
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,599
uh one or both parties not having uh

1313
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,800
clocks i wanted to just go into your do

1314
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
you mean they both don't have a a

1315
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,359
synchronized wall clock or do you mean

1316
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,000
they both can't count seconds or

1317
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,200
milliseconds

1318
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,559
uh uh they uh they uh imagine um one or

1319
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,359
both of uh well actually imagine the

1320
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,680
sender in particular um

1321
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,160
does not have a its clock is zero it's a

1322
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,440
broken claw

1323
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,960
and so

1324
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,520
right and so it's it's identifying

1325
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,559
bundles

1326
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,880
strictly on the basis of

1327
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,000
a counter

1328
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,920
and um

1329
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,680
but it can't measure time in any way

1330
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,040
the only only way it can express the

1331
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,559
retransmission the preferred rate

1332
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,200
transmission time is is is in an

1333
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,160
interval

1334
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,119
yeah okay thanks yeah yeah

1335
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,559
uh joshua you're in the queue if it's a

1336
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,160
quick one go for it or we'll hold to the

1337
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,240
end

1338
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,000
uh we'll see if this uh unmuting

1339
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,160
actually works correctly or not uh so

1340
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,760
this is joshua deaton over here at the

1341
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,599
marshall space flight center

1342
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,000
uh and uh just a quick question might

1343
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,800
just be my uh ignorance from uh

1344
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,040
being new to this particular group uh

1345
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,280
for this vibe are we considering

1346
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,640
specifically tying vibe and ct together

1347
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,040
or are we considering it more as bi

1348
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,359
being a standard and ct being more as

1349
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,200
kind of like an extension of vibe

1350
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,240
so

1351
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,480
i'm going to step in as chair here i

1352
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,880
don't think that is clear in the charter

1353
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,119
they are down as two related but

1354
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,599
possibly separate topics and

1355
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,520
i want to ask that question as well but

1356
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,359
can we let scott get to the end of his

1357
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,640
presentation and pick it up there

1358
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,880
because i think that's quite an in-depth

1359
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,079
series

1360
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,400
thank you

1361
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,920
okay

1362
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,800
um

1363
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,040
let's switch to the other

1364
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,640
and i'll this one is much shorter

1365
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,160
one second while i close this

1366
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,599
is this in the same slide deck scott or

1367
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,760
is this a different no it's a separate

1368
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,640
deck

1369
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,800
okay uh do uh you should be able to

1370
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,520
change deck by the little button in your

1371
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,960
little toolbar you should be able to say

1372
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,520
open new slide deck and find the next

1373
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,680
set of slides uh

1374
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,079
oh okay i thought you guys were doing

1375
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,720
that i can do that if you want

1376
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,680
uh if you can yeah that'd be great okay

1377
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,480
so

1378
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,200
uh oh i have to tell you to stop slide

1379
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,160
sharing

1380
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,520
i then share and it is that one

1381
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,480
chef

1382
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,000
um

1383
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,720
give you the control back there

1384
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,200
excellent um oh

1385
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,598
and the little bar can i get that bar

1386
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,960
you should have that bar i have clicked

1387
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,760
the

1388
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,839
give

1389
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:03,759
control i'm not seeing it and yes

1390
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,160
i'll keep clicking it or i'll try doing

1391
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,240
it

1392
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,520
let me try re-sharing there it is i got

1393
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,800
it got it okay cool yep okay good

1394
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,920
uh

1395
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,559
okay uh the next is a quality service

1396
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,880
and um in addition to um bundle um to um

1397
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,440
uh custody transfer being removed from

1398
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,640
bono protocol in the bpp7

1399
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,079
specification quality of service had

1400
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,119
been in

1401
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,200
in bpv6 and it also is removed from

1402
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,119
bpd7 so here's a

1403
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,400
a

1404
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,880
an attempt to cover the quality of

1405
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,920
service

1406
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,520
um

1407
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,720
issue for

1408
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,800
bpv7 and um

1409
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,040
and elicit the conversation on this

1410
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,000
topic

1411
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,240
so what i will uh suggest to start off

1412
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,760
with here is that the

1413
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,960
the fundamental job of the bundle

1414
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,640
protocol agent is to

1415
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,720
forward bundles to topologically

1416
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,640
adjacent bp nodes that's basically what

1417
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,440
a bpa does it needs to do a lot of other

1418
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,119
things in order to do that it needs to

1419
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,359
compute robson

1420
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,760
various other things but but the thing

1421
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,440
that it mainly does

1422
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,400
is forward bundles to um to other

1423
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,720
nodes that are topologically adjacent to

1424
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,440
it using convergence their protocols to

1425
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,559
do that

1426
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,040
so when when multiple bundles are queued

1427
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,280
up to be forwarded to a given

1428
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,240
topologically adjacent vp node how does

1429
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,400
the bpa decide which one to forward next

1430
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,200
and

1431
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,720
the bp specification is uh silent on

1432
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,280
this uh by default

1433
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,680
the queued up bundles are just forward

1434
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,720
up forwarded in in queue order in first

1435
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,440
in first out order

1436
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,119
quality service would be a mechanism for

1437
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,000
um

1438
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,960
uh

1439
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,000
would be an

1440
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,920
alternative algorithm for making that

1441
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,960
decision

1442
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,160
uh on

1443
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,720
on various bases

1444
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,440
and among the considerations here are

1445
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,599
uh how urgent is this bundle which one's

1446
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:10,720
you know the book you should send the

1447
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,359
urgent ones before others um

1448
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,240
and and assurance that is a guarantee is

1449
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,280
that

1450
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,319
if some

1451
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:19,280
um

1452
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,000
an application has has negotiated a

1453
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,680
guarantee that it gets

1454
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,480
20 of the bandwidth from a to b

1455
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,079
then uh if it's um

1456
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,119
if it's if it's time for it to get some

1457
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,359
some some of that bandwidth then that

1458
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,920
bundle should go even if other bundles

1459
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,160
are are a higher

1460
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,480
are higher priority more urgent

1461
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,319
so um

1462
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,640
a quick um

1463
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,280
survey of quality of service

1464
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,160
um

1465
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,559
that that i drew mostly from from

1466
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:53,839
wikipedia

1467
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,440
uh

1468
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,920
uh the the zeroth order solution for for

1469
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,000
quality services over provision right if

1470
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,559
if you've got so much bandwidth that

1471
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,119
every bundle that you present uh to be

1472
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,000
forwarded uh is forwarded immediately

1473
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,720
then quality services move

1474
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,960
there's there's no queue so the next

1475
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,799
bundle that goes out is the one that is

1476
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,440
going out right now

1477
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,760
you can over provision to some extent

1478
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,440
but

1479
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,400
i will suggest that we'll never actually

1480
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,640
be so over provisioned that

1481
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,960
this is a total solution

1482
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,760
so um

1483
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,720
next

1484
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,960
quality service in the internet

1485
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,920
uh i am very very far from being an

1486
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,079
expert on quality service the internet i

1487
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,880
hope i will not screw this up too badly

1488
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,319
my understanding is that um the the two

1489
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,000
general flavors of

1490
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,720
uh internet qos have been integrated

1491
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,280
services and differentiated services

1492
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,599
um uh inserv

1493
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:56,960
is a

1494
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,400
negotiated

1495
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,040
service reservations for

1496
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,119
sender and receiver

1497
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,520
pairs

1498
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,960
it was the earliest of the

1499
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,160
quality of service mechanisms

1500
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,640
developed for operation on the internet

1501
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,119
and and it worked fine but it doesn't

1502
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,119
easily scale because the

1503
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,880
the number of uh sender receiver pairs

1504
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,079
that you need to support can uh increase

1505
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,440
exponentially

1506
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,400
also it's it's sort of not a a good

1507
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,960
choice for a dtn because it's not delay

1508
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,599
tolerant uh negotiation in general is

1509
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,680
not a delay tolerant mechanism

1510
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,040
so um

1511
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,920
diffserv looks like a closer fit

1512
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,760
um it's

1513
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,799
somewhat

1514
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,640
newer in the internet although been

1515
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,119
around for many years

1516
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:51,520
there's a differentially differentiated

1517
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,280
services code point

1518
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,640
uh code

1519
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,400
a value that is asserted in the packet

1520
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,240
header a six bit number

1521
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,599
that selects per hop behavior and the

1522
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,000
parameters of per hop behavior are

1523
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,160
things like priority

1524
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,480
subject to admission control uh

1525
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,359
assurance of transmission uh

1526
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,280
that's the

1527
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,559
reservation

1528
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,119
um uh sort of uh

1529
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,319
mechanism

1530
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,799
again provided that the traffic rate

1531
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,440
that was negotiated is not exceeded

1532
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,680
and also likelihood of dropping a packet

1533
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,240
when the link is congested those are are

1534
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,160
among the parameters that go into the

1535
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,960
per hop behavior options

1536
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,720
there is no guarantee

1537
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,040
that a given router will exhibit the

1538
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,040
requested behavior for a given packages

1539
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,720
that is uh there isn't anything that

1540
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,640
that

1541
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,880
disqualifies a router

1542
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,839
that happens not to

1543
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:50,400
um

1544
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,520
conform

1545
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,440
to the requested services

1546
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,160
and

1547
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,440
um

1548
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,079
that that um

1549
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,160
the penalty for that uh

1550
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,960
non-conformance is really outside the

1551
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,400
protocol it's a

1552
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,079
matter of business

1553
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,400
um

1554
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,240
and

1555
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,720
then the the last part of this survey is

1556
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,400
okay what did we do in

1557
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,079
version six there was a class of service

1558
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,680
value defined in rfc 5050 uh based on

1559
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,400
the the idea that uh dtn is somewhat

1560
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,520
like uh

1561
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,200
mail and so the

1562
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,319
postal

1563
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:29,760
model of

1564
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,960
of of class of service was introduced

1565
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,799
uh three classes of of uh service bulk

1566
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,960
standard which is like first class mail

1567
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,680
expedited which is like express mail

1568
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,160
the processing of this was not defined

1569
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,799
as usually understood to be a priority

1570
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:48,799
but nothing in the protocol said it had

1571
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,480
to be

1572
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,920
and

1573
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,799
it was frequently observed that this is

1574
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,480
all on the honor system that is it

1575
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,040
doesn't cost anymore to mark a bundle

1576
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,400
that's expedited

1577
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,520
than to mark it as bulk so why would not

1578
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,200
all data be

1579
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,520
uh all bundles be expedited why would

1580
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,599
you say oh my

1581
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,280
please don't send my

1582
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,559
my bottle

1583
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,280
uh slowly i don't care you probably

1584
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,599
wouldn't do that so

1585
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,000
the the there was limited

1586
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,510
um

1587
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:21,920
[Music]

1588
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,559
utility to to the class of service

1589
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,359
as defined in rfc 5050 which is why it

1590
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,799
is removed so um there was

1591
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:31,520
so

1592
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,880
an additional

1593
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,359
internet draft that extended that class

1594
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:39,520
of service mechanism uh prototyped in

1595
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,839
in the ion

1596
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,119
implementation there was a

1597
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,040
that extended class of service included

1598
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,599
an ordinal tag which is a

1599
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,280
more layers of

1600
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,400
um

1601
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,280
of prioritization for expedited bundles

1602
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,760
so scott um i'm watching i'm watching

1603
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,200
the clock you're five minutes over at

1604
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,359
the moment can you uh can you

1605
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,599
can you accelerate in some way uh yeah

1606
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,119
yeah i am trying to but i've got a

1607
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,040
little bit of a late start also uh i

1608
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,400
have trouble there

1609
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,680
there are um uh service selection flags

1610
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,480
best effort reliable critical

1611
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,079
and um

1612
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,359
and a numeric label a data label that

1613
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:18,880
is undefined

1614
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,799
and but likewise that's just you know

1615
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,559
anybody can say anything

1616
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,640
so um

1617
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,200
a a problem with mechanism

1618
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,880
called service quality of service

1619
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,319
mechanisms that

1620
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,640
discussed here is that there's

1621
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,079
an assumption there's no head of line

1622
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,920
blocking that his course quality service

1623
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,839
gets a chance to operate i mean fairly

1624
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:40,480
frequently and that's that's the case

1625
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,599
for ip because packets are very small

1626
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:44,960
uh

1627
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,400
bundles are

1628
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,200
not

1629
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,440
bundles can be very large so head of

1630
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,280
line blocking is very possible and that

1631
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,240
would uh inhibit the operation of

1632
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,160
quality of service mechanism

1633
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,480
uh we still need something

1634
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,559
uh i'm

1635
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,440
suggesting here that uh what we might do

1636
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,559
is is add a bundle processing

1637
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,599
flag

1638
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,680
for uh quality service handling is

1639
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,880
requested and and and

1640
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,720
only allow that flag to be turned on if

1641
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,880
the bundle is

1642
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
less than 64k

1643
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,599
so that quality service makes sense and

1644
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:22,640
then

1645
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,960
along with that say that all bundles

1646
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,520
with quality service flags set to one

1647
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,079
get handled uh before and it bundles for

1648
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,839
the set to zero so that quality service

1649
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:36,319
wins um and

1650
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,880
given that you might define a quality

1651
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,280
service extension block that has uh some

1652
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,240
sort of

1653
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,640
uh type of service request something

1654
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,520
like the the flags and ecos

1655
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,839
and or a numeric

1656
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,200
data label

1657
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,720
um

1658
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,280
and then adam and i and a registry of

1659
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,640
data labels

1660
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,520
and

1661
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,559
the the corresponding requested per-hop

1662
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,280
behaviors in future rfcs

1663
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,720
and again let

1664
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,280
implementation of perhaps behaviors be a

1665
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,799
node implement administration

1666
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,520
responsibility with no guarantees same

1667
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,839
as basically deaf serve that's the end

1668
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,640
of this presentation so um

1669
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,319
any questions

1670
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,319
talk about now in the remaining 12

1671
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,720
seconds

1672
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,440
thank you scott sorry to rush you though

1673
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,559
it's um

1674
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,400
we've got a tight schedule

1675
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,319
thank you for all of this um i think

1676
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,359
it's

1677
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,440
uh particularly the second part i think

1678
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,039
you're you're heading definitely in the

1679
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,480
right direction as far as i'm concerned

1680
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,839
that's me speaking personally not my

1681
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,920
chair hat on um going back to your first

1682
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,119
presentation uh the the the the elephant

1683
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,119
in the room is

1684
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,240
can we do reliability without uh sorry

1685
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,640
custody transfer without requiring

1686
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,880
bundle and bundle encapsulation

1687
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:53,680
and

1688
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,319
and the answer certainly we could have

1689
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,839
uh i i in my mind it only makes sense to

1690
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,680
do it as a reliable convergence their

1691
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,520
protocol i don't i don't think it makes

1692
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,839
sense anywhere else for the reasons that

1693
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,000
we removed it um

1694
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,359
from uh

1695
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:10,799
bpv6

1696
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:14,079
uh so it certainly could be a a separate

1697
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,599
um

1698
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,920
reliable convergence layer

1699
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,240
protocol distinct from bundle and model

1700
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,920
encapsulation

1701
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,200
my

1702
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,799
argument here is

1703
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,520
why i have two when you can use one to

1704
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,480
do

1705
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,920
both jobs but uh i'm

1706
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,079
certainly open to talking about doing a

1707
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,280
different way

1708
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,039
my my reason for not combining the two

1709
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,119
was was simply thinking in terms of

1710
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,920
overhead if if if the custody transfer

1711
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,240
mechanism uses an extension block or or

1712
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,240
some administrative record

1713
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,400
then you're not having to encapsulate an

1714
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,480
entire bundle and it's

1715
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,280
um you know bp sec information or what

1716
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,119
however you know these bundles can get

1717
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:57,680
quite fat if you're not doing a full

1718
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,359
encapsulation that might give you some

1719
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,280
more efficiency on the wire or am i

1720
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,960
misunderstanding that because i haven't

1721
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,240
got data

1722
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,960
if you if you um

1723
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,640
if you're using

1724
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,799
a

1725
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,720
if you're implementing

1726
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,520
a reliable conversator protocol every

1727
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,680
every reliable every every converge

1728
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,440
their protocol encapsulates the entire

1729
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,200
bundle right so you really don't get

1730
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,799
away from the capsule

1731
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,480
in something

1732
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,160
okay thank you thank you i need to go

1733
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,599
back and reread this but thank you

1734
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,240
go ahead zahid

1735
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,599
so scott uh i okay i came up because of

1736
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,240
the third bullet on the current slide uh

1737
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,280
so

1738
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,760
no guarantees as dissolved

1739
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,680
so basically i think they if you look

1740
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,200
into the if you would like to learn

1741
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,440
something from the dip serve that it

1742
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,960
actually not

1743
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,680
it didn't get deployed that much or it

1744
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,559
if it get deployed it didn't used so it

1745
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,799
didn't deliver what it promised for

1746
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,640
so i mean i think

1747
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,160
if you really would like to get the

1748
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,400
reliability really

1749
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,000
get together differential service and

1750
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,599
everything

1751
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:09,440
we might actually need to think a bit

1752
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,799
more before we kind of mimic what is in

1753
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,920
deep serve just like question here i

1754
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,160
mean it all depends on what we want but

1755
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,400
but deep server is a not successful one

1756
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,240
that's what i'm saying uh

1757
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:26,720
right i i uh i i if i came across as as

1758
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,720
advocating that we implement diffserv

1759
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,799
then i misspoke i think this serve is uh

1760
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,920
is a very uh reasonable example of the

1761
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,880
kind of

1762
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:37,839
thing we

1763
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:40,240
want to do i don't think it's the model

1764
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:40,960
for

1765
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,400
bundle protocol

1766
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,440
yeah

1767
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,839
that's that's then i'm in the same place

1768
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,280
thank you

1769
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,039
because that's exactly what i think i

1770
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:50,240
think

1771
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,480
this this reliability thing you know

1772
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,079
whatever prioritization we talk about

1773
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,359
what about like kind of different

1774
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,680
services we talk about this

1775
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,920
service not really an ideal model for

1776
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,960
that one

1777
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,760
i i am further with you on that no

1778
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,319
problem thank you sure

1779
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,280
okay i'm i'm gonna draw a line under the

1780
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,960
the queue at this point thank you very

1781
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,839
much scott

1782
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:15,599
um this is both all three of these

1783
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,440
subjects are really important and and on

1784
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,000
charter and we need to continue um

1785
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,520
possibly even an interim on some of

1786
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,520
these topics might well be worth it so

1787
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,079
we have a bit of time to drill into some

1788
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,760
of this but we'll take that to the list

1789
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,920
to see if there's an appetite for that

1790
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,799
so uh right i'm going to retract your

1791
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,480
ability to show slides

1792
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,599
and

1793
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,920
uh thank you very much brian uh it's uh

1794
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,599
you let me

1795
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,839
share your

1796
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,559
single deck of everything and

1797
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,640
give you permission to

1798
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,400
take control

1799
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,359
and

1800
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,680
um on you go thank you very much all

1801
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,520
right i can see it

1802
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,680
and uh i combined all my slides together

1803
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,119
so i'm just going to go through them uh

1804
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,000
it's the rough order of priority here

1805
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,920
um so the first thing to talk about is

1806
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,599
is maybe the simplest

1807
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,280
which is the administrative record type

1808
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,559
registry

1809
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,799
and what this represents is

1810
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:15,039
oops

1811
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,238
that um in rfc 9171 there was an

1812
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,839
explicit table of

1813
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,439
record types

1814
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,198
and

1815
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:24,399
bpv6

1816
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:26,719
itself did not define a pre-existing

1817
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,000
record but another rfc after bpv6

1818
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,080
defined this registry

1819
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,040
and uh the point of

1820
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,679
what this topic is doing is just adding

1821
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,359
bpv7

1822
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:42,158
to

1823
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,439
the iana registry as a column indicating

1824
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,479
the

1825
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,000
applicability in the same way it was

1826
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:48,960
done for

1827
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,279
uh bundle processing flags

1828
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:55,120
block processing flags and block types

1829
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,560
and

1830
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,198
the other thing that recently i noticed

1831
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,040
was that

1832
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,439
as scott just mentioned the ccsds did

1833
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,198
standardize an aggregate custody signal

1834
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:10,158
and that code point was never actually

1835
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:13,279
rolled back into the iana registry

1836
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,920
so i'll talk about that in a second

1837
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,319
but all this is doing is it's just the

1838
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,238
bookkeeping of making sure that the

1839
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:23,120
registry is accurate and up to date and

1840
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,600
then as a side effect of that it becomes

1841
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,520
then usable for bpv7 allocations so

1842
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,560
vibe

1843
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,359
and

1844
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,359
an allocation

1845
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:36,560
uh needed for acme to do um node id

1846
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,560
validation both would make use of this

1847
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,679
registry and the registry as it sent

1848
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,600
before was specification required uh

1849
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,679
there's no plan on changing that

1850
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,520
and because it's specification required

1851
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,719
then

1852
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:50,960
uh on the next slide here i'll show what

1853
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,839
the the changes would look like that um

1854
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:56,640
code points one two and four

1855
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,800
were already pre-existing

1856
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,320
four actually was the one that was

1857
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,280
missing

1858
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,280
but because it's documented

1859
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,360
in a specification it probably does

1860
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,960
belong there just to indicate that it is

1861
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,719
in use

1862
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,719
and then

1863
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,400
the only other thing this document does

1864
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,080
is it makes a reservation for high value

1865
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,719
code points which because these are cbor

1866
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,960
encoded eventually

1867
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,560
mean that

1868
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,000
that last line is 32-bit values

1869
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,159
so that's four byte encoding all of the

1870
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,520
unassigned

1871
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,239
specifications required are

1872
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:33,360
16 bit values

1873
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,320
and the majority of the specification is

1874
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,159
just text wrapping around

1875
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:41,440
the iana table

1876
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:46,159
update um so on this topic then

1877
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,199
uh this is still an individual draft um

1878
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,000
i'm

1879
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,719
requesting adoption of the document and

1880
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,400
and then at that point

1881
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,679
details could be worked out about

1882
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,280
exactly

1883
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,120
what the text says and what the tables

1884
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,080
contain

1885
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,760
but this is really just a

1886
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,840
currently a placeholder for

1887
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,840
there needs to be some kind of a record

1888
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,360
of

1889
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,719
administrative record type allocations

1890
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,280
um so that's it on this topic

1891
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,840
uh are there any questions immediately

1892
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:22,960
okay just saying noted your uh request

1893
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,880
for working group adoption we'll do the

1894
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,960
uh the relevant um administrative here

1895
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,480
on the list and and just put it out

1896
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,080
there see if anyone's got any objection

1897
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:30,800
but

1898
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,719
it's a very sensible stretch

1899
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:34,080
okay and it's quite short that's the

1900
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,600
intent is it's just touching this one

1901
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,840
table and that's it yeah

1902
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,199
yeah indeed

1903
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:40,880
you've got slightly noisy mic there's a

1904
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,239
bit of fuzz on that if you can

1905
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,679
okay thanks

1906
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,040
try to take care of that

1907
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,600
uh the next uh topic is a cozy context

1908
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,960
for bpsec

1909
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:57,199
um this was discussed at earlier ietf

1910
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,920
so i'm going to get right into detail

1911
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,159
and some of this material is overlapping

1912
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,920
with previous discussion but the idea is

1913
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,280
that

1914
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,800
bp sec

1915
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,560
has

1916
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,080
a default security context that's

1917
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,159
intentionally limited in scope it does

1918
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,880
the job that it needs to for

1919
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,960
a number of symmetric key

1920
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,159
algorithms

1921
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,880
um it doesn't include things like key

1922
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,960
identifiers uh

1923
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,120
that would be needed for uh certain

1924
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,440
rollover situations um

1925
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,600
and it it's not

1926
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,920
a bp stack is made to be extensible but

1927
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,320
the default security context um

1928
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,280
are just limited by design

1929
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,239
so

1930
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:41,280
for uh internet facing uh

1931
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,840
nodes and interpretation especially for

1932
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,360
things that like scott was just talking

1933
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,159
about

1934
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:47,679
security gateways

1935
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,880
processing and unprotected

1936
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,040
external network things like

1937
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,480
where you have to interoperate retain

1938
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,760
agencies

1939
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,880
that's where pki is really the

1940
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,400
current

1941
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,400
standard of interoperation

1942
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,440
and one way to get pki uh immediately

1943
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,800
off the shelf

1944
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,960
is using um cose the seaboard object

1945
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,880
signing in encryption

1946
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,360
and uh it is

1947
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,640
almost

1948
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,719
purpose built for this kind of

1949
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:21,520
one directional

1950
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,080
security application

1951
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:24,960
and

1952
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,520
on the next slide i'll show

1953
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,199
some information about

1954
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,199
the the idea here is that this is

1955
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:34,640
falling in the existing bp sec paradigm

1956
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,239
it's using existing parameters and

1957
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:37,120
result

1958
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,640
allocations

1959
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,600
everything

1960
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,440
it's very nice that kosa actually does

1961
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,040
fit extremely well within the bpsec

1962
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,280
framework that's already in place

1963
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,600
and uh

1964
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,800
part of

1965
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,280
what this is gonna do is it's it's

1966
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,440
adding more

1967
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,719
um

1968
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,360
even more extensibility to to bp bpsec

1969
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,400
that

1970
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,520
in a

1971
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,800
even in a tightly constrained

1972
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,320
environment there are

1973
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,400
abilities to use pki

1974
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,239
uh with cos a that are already in

1975
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,480
practice and in use in other

1976
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,640
applications

1977
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,800
and the last gain is really that the

1978
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,760
cose

1979
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,000
as an active working group is already in

1980
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,679
progress of

1981
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,000
uh standardizing on some hybrid public

1982
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,600
key encryption and post quantum

1983
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,840
cryptography algorithms so these things

1984
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,080
are already being worked there in active

1985
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,520
development

1986
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,840
and a cosec security context would be

1987
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,320
able to take advantage of these things

1988
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,360
when they become available

1989
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,760
so the idea here is that one context

1990
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,199
would be given

1991
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:46,800
for both bib and bcb and it's the

1992
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,679
type

1993
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,280
identifiers that distinguish the

1994
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,800
different uses and this is how kosa

1995
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,199
already operates that there's one cose

1996
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,480
structure

1997
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,640
and within that structure

1998
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,640
there's a differentiation between

1999
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,440
signing mac behaviors and

2000
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,760
encryption behaviors

2001
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,719
and

2002
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:07,920
uh cose also brings with it the ability

2003
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,800
to use a pki environment and also the

2004
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,360
the ability to transport pki secondary

2005
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,800
information so cos a itself can embed

2006
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,760
um

2007
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,080
things like x 509 certificates and in

2008
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,800
the future potential other certification

2009
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,800
data

2010
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:29,679
then uh the one thing that cos a does

2011
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:32,480
not define is a real usage profile coset

2012
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,360
is

2013
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,239
fundamentally a container for security

2014
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,280
data

2015
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,640
but it doesn't give you a

2016
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,960
tight definition of what belongs

2017
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,960
in a coset message

2018
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,800
and so part of this document is defining

2019
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,640
how do you put a cose message in a bp

2020
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,280
sec block and the other part of it is

2021
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,840
what is the profile with which the cosa

2022
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,840
is supposed to be used

2023
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,800
so this interoperability profile

2024
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,840
covers some symmetric key behavior

2025
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,640
key wrap behavior and

2026
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,600
the main

2027
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,360
new addition for bpsec would be the pki

2028
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,199
behavior and the asymmetric key behavior

2029
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,280
so this table indicates

2030
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,480
these would be the

2031
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,920
minimum

2032
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,000
interoperability requirements and some

2033
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,360
of these things are required the

2034
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,640
symmetric key behavior and some of these

2035
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,400
are recommended to asymmetric behavior

2036
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,199
now

2037
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,880
this is for an interoperability profile

2038
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,040
this doesn't constrain

2039
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,000
or require any particular network

2040
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,920
to use any of these algorithms

2041
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,840
operationally this is just saying

2042
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,800
for an interoperability um this is what

2043
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,080
should be supported

2044
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,320
and uh none of these algorithms would be

2045
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,159
surprising uh to anybody who's using

2046
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,280
modern pki that these are the current

2047
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,800
um

2048
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,880
i would say state of the art of

2049
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,960
of uh

2050
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,800
current pki

2051
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,679
and pki over x 509

2052
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,159
especially

2053
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,040
and that is also one thing that

2054
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,719
the second point on this last slide is

2055
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:07,440
that

2056
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,480
um

2057
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,960
the main benefit here to a network

2058
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,040
operator is that

2059
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,640
this uh

2060
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,800
structure this cose messaging behavior

2061
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,400
is going to work

2062
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,480
i would say off the shelf in an existing

2063
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,760
environment where entities already have

2064
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,760
a pki x 509 environment i already have a

2065
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,080
certification authority already have

2066
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,159
infrastructure for distributing

2067
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,560
certificates and keys

2068
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,120
this is purely on the wire

2069
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,920
how to get that information

2070
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,840
embedded into a bbsec

2071
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,480
block uh

2072
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,239
so this document hasn't been touched in

2073
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:47,520
a while um

2074
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,880
so the there's a at least one known

2075
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,040
change that's needed just to bring

2076
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,000
this

2077
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,840
security context into alignment with the

2078
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,080
rfc 9173

2079
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,760
it's not a change in the information

2080
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,520
content it's only a change in

2081
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,120
encoding and it's not even on the wire

2082
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,360
encoding it's

2083
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,719
additional authenticated data encoding

2084
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,800
there are some secondary questions that

2085
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,400
this is currently not a

2086
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,800
working group document but if it were to

2087
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,880
become a working group document

2088
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,040
then we would need to deal with

2089
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,000
more details like

2090
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,760
processing requirements

2091
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,679
beyond bp sec related to the fact that

2092
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:28,960
when you're dealing with pki

2093
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,400
environments there's no distinction

2094
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,719
between

2095
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,760
identifiers and identity that is

2096
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,000
authenticated

2097
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,040
so just little details that uh

2098
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,400
need to be worked out for

2099
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,080
interoperability

2100
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,159
and then the the second item is is

2101
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:48,080
really about uh

2102
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,159
are there additional minimum

2103
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,520
cose header

2104
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,960
contents so for example s mime

2105
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,120
as it stands right now does have a

2106
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,199
minimum that is more heavyweight

2107
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:02,400
than what's in this draft document but

2108
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,760
maybe

2109
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,920
that's not really necessary and

2110
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,120
this would be something that would be

2111
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,360
worth taking uh

2112
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,199
advantage of learning

2113
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:13,199
from the s mime

2114
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,239
um

2115
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:15,280
upkeep

2116
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,480
working group

2117
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,280
uh

2118
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,440
what is valuable and what's not valuable

2119
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,040
especially in a large environment like

2120
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,239
what s mime has to support

2121
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:30,719
so that's my last slide on this topic

2122
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,560
and um

2123
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,840
it's not stated on the sl oh go ahead

2124
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,760
yeah all right just to jump in on the

2125
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,320
queue uh with my chair hat off but but

2126
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,480
just speaking uh from a bp sac

2127
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,280
perspective uh i'm a i'm a fan of this

2128
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,760
work uh i think that the you know part

2129
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,960
of the idea behind a security context

2130
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,760
was

2131
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,920
bpv7 networks

2132
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,440
are going to be deployed in a variety of

2133
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,239
different ways and the security context

2134
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:01,280
is the mapping of the block level

2135
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,800
fidelity that bpsac requires to the

2136
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,719
underlying environments and networks

2137
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,960
where we will be running uh

2138
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,400
bundles and so if if we in this working

2139
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,600
group were to produce um a context that

2140
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,920
tells us how to perform this block level

2141
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,280
fidelity in a pkix environment

2142
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,320
that that makes a lot of sense to me so

2143
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,400
with chairhead off a big fan of this

2144
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,920
work and and

2145
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,280
it would be nice to see it adopted

2146
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,560
oh and and it's not on the slide but uh

2147
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,719
i will bring up that there are

2148
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:37,679
uh

2149
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,880
discussions in nasa and i believe in in

2150
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,400
ccsds

2151
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,760
about

2152
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,440
the need for a kind of a interagency pki

2153
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,600
type type of thing just in the general

2154
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,080
concept

2155
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,320
and

2156
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,400
so i will

2157
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,520
propose

2158
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,199
that this uh

2159
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,040
is adopted by the working group

2160
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,239
uh

2161
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,280
and whatever

2162
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,840
needs to be done to uh

2163
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,719
to further that along

2164
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,719
brian i've made a note of that as well

2165
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,719
i'm watching the clock because we are

2166
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:16,639
yeah we never seem to have enough time

2167
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,199
we might book two sessions this is this

2168
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,760
is just one of those things so um all

2169
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,600
right do you want to move on

2170
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,000
yep uh the next topic is going to be

2171
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,199
quite short

2172
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,400
and what it represents is

2173
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,880
the idea that there are currently

2174
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,639
applications that are doing processing

2175
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:37,600
on bpv6 and b7

2176
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,960
at the same time in the sense that the

2177
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,600
same entity is is processing both types

2178
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,719
of bundles

2179
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,280
and the convergence layers are currently

2180
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,639
shared

2181
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,159
in these entities between these

2182
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,360
different purposes

2183
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,840
and and there's not a well-defined way

2184
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:52,800
of

2185
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,719
receiving a

2186
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,040
chunk of data and saying this is a ppv6

2187
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,400
bundle this is a bpv7 bundle um

2188
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,679
explicitly

2189
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,520
and so

2190
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,880
in in v6 and prior the version has a

2191
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,600
specific offset v7 because it's using a

2192
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,040
sebor structure and because it's a

2193
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,880
nested structure

2194
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,760
it's not a nested offset and the root of

2195
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,679
bringing this up is that there are

2196
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:21,280
existing tools that assume that a bpv7

2197
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,159
bundle is encoded exactly as some of the

2198
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:25,520
example bundles

2199
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,440
and so that if the example has the

2200
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,159
version at offset 3 and size 1

2201
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:33,360
that that is how bundles operate

2202
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,280
that that these tools will break when

2203
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,520
they are given bundles that

2204
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,560
are still conformant to bpv7 but don't

2205
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,679
follow the same assumptions

2206
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,639
and

2207
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,000
there's also

2208
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,679
separate from an agent that is

2209
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:50,320
processing this kind of data

2210
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,199
there

2211
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,880
it can be a need to identify a byte

2212
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,639
string as a bundle version

2213
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,000
and not actually have to process the

2214
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,280
full bundle because

2215
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,280
the a trivial way of saying how do you

2216
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,719
differentiate is

2217
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,760
throw this chunk of data at a v7 decoder

2218
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,840
and give me a result or an error throw

2219
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,239
this at a v6 decoder and the point of

2220
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,080
this document is to be a little more

2221
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,960
fine-grained than that

2222
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:14,239
there's an existing document that

2223
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,400
defines a kind of a trivial mechanism to

2224
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,320
do this but again this

2225
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,280
is not

2226
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,639
looking at it from

2227
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,880
maybe an operational perspective of

2228
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,679
of how a system should really do this so

2229
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,520
there's two different aspects to this

2230
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,120
proposed mechanism

2231
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,800
and one of them is

2232
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,000
uh

2233
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,120
in the logical sense how do you

2234
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,880
distinguish between these things so the

2235
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,639
good news is that uh

2236
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,560
the two encodings actually don't have

2237
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,800
any collision between how they operate

2238
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,719
so there's an unambiguous way of of

2239
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:43,760
doing this

2240
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,520
uh detection

2241
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,520
and in the logical sense

2242
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,639
um

2243
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,159
the general purpose algorithm of just

2244
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:50,960
saying

2245
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,239
treat it as

2246
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:56,000
a stream of sibor content and do a

2247
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,920
certain decoding sequence will do the

2248
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,080
job so that's one way of doing it that

2249
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,760
will work in any case that's the the

2250
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,400
general purpose given a a

2251
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,400
arbitrary chunk of data that will work

2252
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,199
that method will work but part of what

2253
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,040
would be what could be beneficial to

2254
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,920
have documented are some optimized

2255
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,760
uh more optimized algorithms that do

2256
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,040
more of like pattern matching type

2257
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,320
behavior

2258
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,080
and if you're in a network where you

2259
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,120
know

2260
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,080
that uh bundles are going to be produced

2261
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,840
in certain ways that they're always

2262
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,679
going to use deterministic encoding that

2263
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,560
they're always going to um to have

2264
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,440
certain

2265
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,600
properties to them then

2266
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,520
we can do things in a more optimized way

2267
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,440
so this these optimized behaviors are

2268
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,000
not strictly necessary but

2269
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,600
it seems like there can be some value in

2270
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,600
at least having them documented in an

2271
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,480
informational way so that uh there's no

2272
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,320
need to reinvent the wheel in some of

2273
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,799
these cases

2274
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,920
i'm not gonna go through the dock the

2275
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,239
optimize methods but

2276
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,880
what they amount to is

2277
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,080
doing some non-sebor

2278
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,920
seaboard decoding so you wouldn't need

2279
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,000
to use a full-fledged seaboard decoder

2280
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,400
you just need to do some bit operations

2281
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,239
that effectively do seaboard decoding

2282
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,960
and then the optimize two method is is a

2283
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,480
byte string pattern matching and if

2284
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,480
you're in a if you're in a constrained

2285
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,320
environment and a fixed encoding

2286
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,080
environment you can

2287
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,360
use

2288
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,360
pattern matching like that but what this

2289
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,960
document would it would say is that

2290
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,719
you only can do this in a

2291
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,159
controlled environment

2292
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,960
so feel free to do it but just know that

2293
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,000
if

2294
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,520
you're given valid bundles it might

2295
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,000
break your implementation

2296
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,480
uh so this is not yet part of a real

2297
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,480
draft document um this is just saying

2298
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,400
is there interest in this kind of thing

2299
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,480
and the main benefit here is is

2300
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,239
interoperability the the point is just

2301
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,320
to make sure that people don't create

2302
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,920
tools that are

2303
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,600
going into

2304
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,600
processing a received chunk of data that

2305
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,000
are going to fail in

2306
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,320
maybe predictable ways that we can try

2307
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,480
and avoid

2308
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,560
and these steps are not parallel steps

2309
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,120
these are sequential next steps of if

2310
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,440
there's interest creating a document

2311
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,639
um

2312
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,560
thanks brian uh

2313
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,400
i think really interesting this is me

2314
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,360
with my uh speaking personally um i

2315
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,800
think a a short concise informational

2316
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,440
rfc has value just to

2317
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,280
to maintain interoperability that isn't

2318
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,920
that half the purpose of the itf so

2319
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,800
there is v6 still flying um

2320
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,440
literally um it's worth making sure this

2321
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,560
decoder

2322
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,800
the decoder logic is consistent and that

2323
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,000
we can point implementers at best

2324
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,920
practice i think there's some value in

2325
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:48,639
that

2326
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:50,159
um i'm watching the clock i'm really

2327
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:51,520
sorry is anyone else in the queue with

2328
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,679
comment on any of these documents

2329
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:56,400
go ahead joshua

2330
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,440
uh hey so yeah this is joshua deaton

2331
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,960
over here at uh marshall space flight

2332
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,280
center uh in regards to the

2333
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,880
interoperability for v6 and v7 stuff

2334
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,000
um for our implementation of dtnme for

2335
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,760
use with the iss

2336
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,520
we did kind of follow the same general

2337
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,639
idea

2338
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,120
since we were starting with v6 to begin

2339
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,480
with uh we did follow the path of

2340
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,400
uh verify

2341
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,840
uh whether v6 the actual uh

2342
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,560
encoding for saying we're using v6 is

2343
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,199
correct and if it's not then check if

2344
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,920
it's a v7 bundle and if both fail it's

2345
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,679
obviously malformed

2346
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:37,520
uh but yeah this is definitely something

2347
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,800
that uh

2348
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,560
at least we think there's some value in

2349
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,840
okay

2350
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,760
great joshua uh in which case brian

2351
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,600
because you're now over time i'm going

2352
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,560
to hand swiftly on to emery

2353
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,000
about

2354
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,360
we are

2355
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,719
genuinely going to have to have two

2356
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:58,719
sessions next time we never seem to have

2357
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,840
enough time

2358
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:03,280
let me

2359
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,560
share emery's slides and

2360
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,560
hand over sure

2361
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:12,159
so emery you should see a little sort of

2362
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,760
semi-transparent overlay to allow you to

2363
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,600
go left and right uh

2364
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,360
how long have we given you if i give you

2365
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,480
a 10 minute

2366
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,960
countdown instead of your 15 uh we can

2367
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,199
then overrun by three minutes as we do

2368
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:25,520
with everyone else that's okay

2369
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,360
that will make it work can you all hear

2370
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,839
me

2371
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:32,880
i can hear you

2372
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,719
okay cool um

2373
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:36,400
thank you yes i see the slides i've got

2374
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,320
the button uh ready to roll um and i

2375
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,639
will make it uh make it short um so

2376
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,560
first off just to kind of talk about

2377
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,719
this is a refresh of the asynchronous

2378
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,199
management architecture uh this falls

2379
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,280
firmly under the new charter for you

2380
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,000
know an oam architecture and solutions

2381
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,880
to meet network management uh so

2382
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,080
just want to talk about the latest

2383
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,880
updates to the doc and ask really what

2384
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,960
are the next steps to move this forward

2385
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,280
since this is the informational sort of

2386
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,360
motivation for uh

2387
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,120
why we need the network financial

2388
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,120
architecture and uh what are the

2389
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,920
approaches to that so with that said the

2390
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,040
first thing

2391
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,400
we've renamed it uh to dtn management

2392
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,040
architecture uh and this is just to sort

2393
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,000
of be more in alignment with what are we

2394
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,400
trying to solve here right so the new

2395
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,040
document is posted here uh

2396
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,880
it maintains basically all the same

2397
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,040
motivation design principles and concept

2398
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,800
of the previous document just a little

2399
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,880
bit of clarity here and there the main

2400
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,400
focus and and the reason for the

2401
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,719
renaming is this is a document that is

2402
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,639
designed to address challenged networks

2403
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:46,560
i.e the delay tolerant networks

2404
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,400
so just to touch on some of the things

2405
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,719
that kind of have been clarified or

2406
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,560
updated in this document

2407
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,320
the document specifies

2408
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,000
very clearly what are the services

2409
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,920
needed by a dtn management architecture

2410
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,000
and one of the desirable properties of a

2411
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,239
solution that meets

2412
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:07,360
these different services so i called out

2413
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,880
a few here most of these were the same

2414
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,320
but i called out a few here so

2415
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,000
authorized administration accounting and

2416
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,560
error control asynchronous dynamic

2417
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,639
hydrological architecture

2418
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:18,800
model derived and hierarchically

2419
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,520
organized uh definition of information i

2420
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,440
call these out because they are new

2421
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,679
sections but they just are there to try

2422
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:28,000
and further emphasize uh

2423
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,159
you know the scope uh and then in the

2424
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:31,440
need of

2425
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,320
this uh management solution so to touch

2426
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,840
on a few of those uh this is sort of

2427
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,280
triple a i mean one of the design

2428
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:38,960
criteria you see this across almost

2429
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,040
every network management solution is the

2430
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,480
need to

2431
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,920
authorize those controls that reporting

2432
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:46,880
that are coming into the network

2433
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,400
management solution because

2434
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,520
this has to be built on top of dtn uh it

2435
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,000
can't necessarily be built uh within the

2436
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,040
protocol as a very sort of synchronous

2437
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,120
uh you know handshake to set up these

2438
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,080
commands but there is a need to do that

2439
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,159
so a section and there was verbiage all

2440
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:05,679
throughout the document kind of talking

2441
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:07,120
about this already but i think it

2442
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,920
deserved a section that really described

2443
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,159
that need up front so

2444
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:15,679
this new section that states that

2445
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,520
in asynchronous dynamic highly logical

2446
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,679
architecture so this really speaks to

2447
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:22,400
the need to operate within dtn thinking

2448
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,320
kind of in the back of the vine how does

2449
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,320
a bundle protocol

2450
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,840
work uh

2451
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,639
how does bp sec work so we're trying to

2452
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:32,639
say here that

2453
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:36,639
the concept of this topology uh is very

2454
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,480
dynamic uh

2455
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,120
the the roles assumed within the network

2456
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,560
uh can evolve over time in fact as a

2457
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,280
message moves from a you know sender to

2458
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,719
a destination

2459
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,320
a new destination may assume that

2460
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,560
logical role right so so we still need

2461
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,560
to deliver that too in the case of a

2462
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,719
network management a manager

2463
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,800
but that manager might have changed in

2464
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,960
addition there might be multiple

2465
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,159
managers

2466
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:04,080
either coordinating or working with a

2467
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,080
receiving ports to a single agent so

2468
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,600
we're trying to call that out up front

2469
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,520
and say that there's a need for this

2470
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,040
sort of logical architecture

2471
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,080
um the last change here was say it was

2472
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,000
just saying up front that

2473
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,360
what we want is sort of a model driven

2474
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:24,080
architecture uh you know that

2475
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,040
we talk a lot about autonomy in this

2476
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,679
model which autonomy has often performed

2477
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:31,920
in other uh in other working groups or

2478
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,920
in other solutions as a very much sort

2479
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,560
of back and forth interaction between

2480
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,440
those managed elements uh and and the

2481
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,600
managers um

2482
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,520
to achieve autonomy in a dtn management

2483
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,719
solution

2484
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:48,320
we very much need a model driven

2485
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,400
approach and furthermore it needs to

2486
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,120
support uh you know compression and

2487
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,400
there's very various different ways you

2488
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,760
can approach compression so a hierarchy

2489
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,880
i can't speak

2490
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,920
organized model driven approach

2491
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,639
should give means to some of that um and

2492
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:05,679
i think a lot of these things that i'm

2493
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:07,600
talking about

2494
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,320
feed right into the approach of amp and

2495
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,080
the data models that support network

2496
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,679
management as they've been being

2497
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,600
implemented worked and discussed this

2498
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,159
working group for some time um i think

2499
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,520
as far as the

2500
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,360
high vision architecture just calls us

2501
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,600
out up front

2502
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,080
so a few other minor updates uh this one

2503
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,960
here simply just walks through the roles

2504
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,520
and responsibilities of an agent and a

2505
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,199
manager the agent being the thing that

2506
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,120
you're going to manage whether it be uh

2507
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,639
you know the applications behind the

2508
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:38,320
space vehicle the protocols that are

2509
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,080
managing the network on the space

2510
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,679
vehicle um as well as the manager the

2511
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:45,760
the node that is ultimately sending

2512
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,120
messages to

2513
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,120
uh those agents and receiving reports

2514
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,719
from those so just a little bit of

2515
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:53,280
clarity kind of walking behind exactly

2516
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,120
what is the role and the responsibility

2517
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,120
of each one of these uh

2518
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,159
of these

2519
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,480
roles

2520
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,199
and then lastly uh we have to do some

2521
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:04,719
pictures in the back

2522
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:07,199
i think to stress a little bit that this

2523
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:10,320
is indeed a solution for a challenged

2524
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,360
uh

2525
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,360
challenged network management solution

2526
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,679
so first picture kind of said hey look

2527
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:18,080
agent b here might lose connectivity for

2528
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,840
some time even though it's generating

2529
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,159
reports to send back to the manager it

2530
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:24,320
still is going to generate those reports

2531
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,880
and it will deliver them asynchronously

2532
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,719
at a future point in time so it just

2533
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,320
calls that out in this picture here the

2534
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,000
next picture uh

2535
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,960
there is a statement that uh the the

2536
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,679
agent should try and compress and

2537
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,320
combine messages where possible so this

2538
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,639
effectively describes that where agent b

2539
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,199
has been asked to produce two different

2540
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:48,239
reports

2541
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,800
so from that time on it combines those

2542
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,560
two reports and passes them as a single

2543
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,000
message

2544
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,360
and some of this is actually handled

2545
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,719
maybe by

2546
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:58,480
the bundle protocol agent not

2547
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,679
necessarily the network management

2548
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:00,719
solution

2549
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:02,080
these get the working concert to one

2550
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,840
another

2551
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,400
and the last update to picture here is

2552
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,000
showing this multiplex management

2553
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,119
between

2554
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:11,679
fusion between potentially two managers

2555
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,920
that are both controlling the same or

2556
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,960
multiple agents uh how are they

2557
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,320
communicating

2558
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,080
to one another how are they fusing data

2559
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,600
and passing it and this goes back to

2560
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,080
like i said the clarity of the roles of

2561
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,159
those logical agent and manager so this

2562
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,800
picture tries to speak to specifically

2563
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,679
okay using that definition of

2564
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,840
the the responsibilities of each it

2565
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,920
tries to address that

2566
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,280
so

2567
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,960
my questions to the working group first

2568
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,440
and foremost uh what is needed to finish

2569
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,239
this architecture uh what is missing

2570
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,600
what's wrong

2571
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,960
um

2572
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,480
we would like to move this forward so

2573
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,800
that's the the open question right and

2574
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,719
then what are are there any accompanying

2575
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:54,239
documents that need to go with this one

2576
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:55,520
so i'll pause for a brief minute before

2577
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,760
i give my second section

2578
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,600
and ask i see ed's hand up

2579
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:07,760
so ed with my chair hat off uh is is to

2580
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,960
make an observation uh which is uh at

2581
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,480
the beginning of this we mentioned that

2582
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,000
this document had been renamed from the

2583
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,840
asynchronous management architecture to

2584
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,280
the delay tolerant network management

2585
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,520
architecture and one of the observations

2586
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,840
there was the term asynchronous uh

2587
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,560
caused some confusion uh asynchronous as

2588
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,280
it as it be as we use it in in very

2589
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,880
challenged networks like a dtn

2590
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,960
architecture mean that the transport

2591
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,199
layer is asynchronous that you may have

2592
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:34,960
unidirectional links you may have long

2593
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,719
periods of time without being able to

2594
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:39,760
communicate end to end however uh

2595
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,719
another use of asynchronous means not

2596
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:44,560
holding session state and perhaps just

2597
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,239
using rest restful interfaces over tcp

2598
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,639
so one of the one of the things that has

2599
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,000
to be done in this management

2600
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,239
architecture is to really differentiate

2601
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:56,000
the fact that asynchronous is

2602
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,760
asynchronous all the way down to the

2603
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,080
transport layer requiring that level of

2604
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,960
autonomy um when we get to that point

2605
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:05,280
and how we use those those autonomy

2606
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,320
models uh the work is is unique so as

2607
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,639
long as we maintain that focus of uh

2608
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:12,880
asynchronicity all the way down to the

2609
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,560
transport layer uh

2610
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,400
that that needs to be there so with that

2611
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,440
i'll

2612
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,480
that was just a comment not a question

2613
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:24,080
awesome i saw josh's hand go up

2614
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,040
hey uh so

2615
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,480
this could be something that i may have

2616
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,679
just missed because it's been a little

2617
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:31,199
while since i've done a true deep dive

2618
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:34,159
of some of these documents but uh does

2619
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,159
this the current state of the standard

2620
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:39,360
cover a situation for

2621
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,440
um

2622
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,600
handling reports

2623
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,719
that have not been able to be sent for

2624
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:49,040
extended periods of time per se

2625
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,880
so like obviously the nominal situation

2626
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,960
is that even if there's been a delay

2627
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,239
and you weren't able to send it right

2628
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:56,080
away that it'll still try and send the

2629
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,320
next opportunity that it has

2630
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,280
but

2631
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,920
does the standard provide a mechanism to

2632
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,040
say

2633
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,280
if x happens or something else happens

2634
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:06,880
or something else happens

2635
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,800
do something different with the report

2636
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,199
so that you don't all of a sudden send a

2637
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:14,560
thousand reports down at once

2638
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,800
so i others might have comments on this

2639
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,520
but i think the standard doesn't have an

2640
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,360
answer for that or the proposed document

2641
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,760
doesn't have an answer for that however

2642
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,320
um i think that can be accomplished a

2643
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,600
little bit separately so that the

2644
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,600
concept of the logical data model that

2645
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,520
describes uh you know the rules

2646
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,239
associated with the generation uh or or

2647
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,880
frequency of reporting um

2648
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,800
i think personal preference here that

2649
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,480
maybe we should have a capability to

2650
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,719
apply policy to those so in the case

2651
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:44,159
like you just described maybe there's a

2652
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:45,920
system level policy which would be

2653
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,159
supported by an additional data model

2654
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:51,679
that says okay uh the lifetime of this

2655
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:53,040
delete after a certain time or when

2656
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,880
storage gets above this threshold deep

2657
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,119
delete things that are there older after

2658
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:59,920
this time um i think this

2659
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,239
the ama in particular the dtnma i

2660
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:04,400
apologize i've been speaking it too long

2661
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:08,159
um is uh sets us up for like i said the

2662
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:09,920
motivation for that challenge network

2663
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,480
management uh need for that logical data

2664
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,719
model leave need for

2665
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,280
autonomous driven but deterministic

2666
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,960
behavior

2667
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,280
which we can then add what you just

2668
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,759
described

2669
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,920
i'm gonna jump in at this point it's

2670
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:28,400
rick with my chair hat on uh first off

2671
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,159
because i'm watching the clock

2672
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:31,440
um

2673
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,639
so

2674
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,480
i think to answer the question on the

2675
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,440
screen

2676
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,119
i think having this is an arc and also

2677
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:38,800
to answer that previous question this is

2678
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,280
an architectural document and so i think

2679
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,119
it should be able to proceed

2680
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:45,679
uh without any accompanying documents

2681
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,199
the accompanying documents can come

2682
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:48,320
after

2683
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,719
that's commonly how how one does

2684
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:54,560
architectural documents in the ietf so i

2685
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:56,320
politely request

2686
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,920
working group participants to go away

2687
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,880
and re-read this document it has changed

2688
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:03,119
noticeably and from my reading is a huge

2689
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:05,199
improvement so thank you emery and the

2690
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:07,040
rest of the team who've worked on this

2691
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,760
um please reread please review and let's

2692
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:10,960
see whether we can really make some

2693
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,719
progress on this as an architectural

2694
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:15,280
document from which we can start to hang

2695
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,880
off the accompanying documents and

2696
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,119
address questions like like joshua's and

2697
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,880
get into the depths of data models and

2698
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,639
protocols and policies and all this kind

2699
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:23,600
of stuff

2700
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,280
um

2701
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,520
does that sound reasonable

2702
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,639
yeah good

2703
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,040
so i'm conscious that sarah got bumped

2704
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:31,840
out

2705
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:34,719
from iutf112 and i really wanted to have

2706
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:36,320
an opportunity to present what she tried

2707
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,320
to present last time so

2708
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,840
if there's nobody else thank you very

2709
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,520
much emery and we'll jump straight

2710
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,440
across to sarah

2711
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,119
um yep roger

2712
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:46,880
did you want me to go through just real

2713
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,080
quick and

2714
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,719
let me do this real quick there is some

2715
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:52,320
there is some additional information to

2716
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,119
the slides there is a new document uh

2717
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:56,560
it's right now a sort of personal

2718
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,880
document uh saying we need to

2719
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,800
have a method to name

2720
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,159
uh resources in the uh application

2721
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,719
models they're being defined um

2722
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,159
so my question i'll kind of jump forward

2723
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,000
to this and i think this needs to work

2724
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,320
my question here is is this the sort of

2725
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,840
thing that the working group is

2726
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,080
interested in uh

2727
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,360
and then you know what are the next

2728
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:19,040
steps to kind of move that forward so we

2729
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,960
can take that offline so we can just

2730
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:22,320
chair

2731
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,000
again as chair i think this is within

2732
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
scope of the uh the working group

2733
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,159
charter i think you should push this out

2734
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:30,800
as a personal draft i think uh you

2735
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,800
should draw attention to it and

2736
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,520
garner interest on the mailing list and

2737
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,880
what we're going to have to have two

2738
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,480
sessions at the next ietf because we

2739
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,560
have so much content we'll have a proper

2740
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,560
dive into it and

2741
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,639
if you get sufficient review we go for

2742
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:46,080
working group adoption et cetera et

2743
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,239
cetera but uh let's separate the track

2744
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:50,639
of that kind of thing from the progress

2745
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:52,880
on the architecture ed are you agreeing

2746
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:53,920
or disagreeing

2747
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,520
i i am agreeing this they should

2748
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,440
eventually come into the fold uh but

2749
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,600
let's go on to sarah yeah

2750
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:00,880
perfect

2751
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:05,040
thanks very much emery uh i will

2752
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,840
stop revoke your permission this slide

2753
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,159
thing is almost very clever

2754
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:11,040
uh

2755
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,040
dude

2756
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:18,719
there we go so sarah you should have

2757
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,119
control

2758
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:22,800
yes okay

2759
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,880
cool okay so um

2760
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,639
if if you all remember last time i

2761
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,400
presented about the asynchronous network

2762
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,920
management system this is a network

2763
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,719
management system we are creating to

2764
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:34,239
be able to

2765
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:35,679
operate

2766
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:36,960
the

2767
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,560
the dtm protocols

2768
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,520
beside

2769
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,880
terrestrial networks so next

2770
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,840
i have a quick overview again these you

2771
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,600
probably saw these slides last time so

2772
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,679
the the goals of ams are to enable

2773
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,199
missions to

2774
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,880
be able to

2775
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,400
use the

2776
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,880
disruption tolerant networks um

2777
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:59,119
help people use amp and be able to adopt

2778
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:02,159
amp and also serve as the baseline for

2779
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,639
the amp specification um so we will be

2780
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:06,639
tracking all the changes to the sec and

2781
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:07,920
we'll be incorporating that into our

2782
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:11,639
network management system

2783
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,840
so here quickly is

2784
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,600
what our layer one decomposition looks

2785
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,119
like so at a very high level that blue

2786
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:23,760
pill shape in the center is a mms we

2787
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,920
want to enable

2788
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,520
connections to other machines on the

2789
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,119
terrestrial network as well as

2790
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:31,440
connections to agents

2791
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,360
in the the space networks

2792
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,520
and then allow mission operators to have

2793
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,520
some default visualizations into the

2794
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,360
system as well as be able to do some

2795
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,040
command and control from

2796
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,239
uh or through a ms

2797
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:46,560
um the the ams services include you know

2798
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:47,920
normal services that you'd see in a

2799
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:51,360
network management system such as

2800
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,600
you know data management and service and

2801
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,440
storage uh health and status monitoring

2802
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,199
et cetera but then also

2803
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:59,520
agent command and control uh through amp

2804
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,639
and we are also aiming for a ms to be

2805
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:04,320
um

2806
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,440
incredibly containerized and modular so

2807
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:10,159
uh orchestration of the internal amms

2808
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,840
systems and then also

2809
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,400
ability to plug in your own systems

2810
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,920
whenever uh

2811
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,600
whenever it's useful so for example if

2812
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:18,880
you have your own visualization tool

2813
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,280
that you'd like to bring into anms

2814
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:23,760
we want to have the standard interfaces

2815
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:25,760
and the modular system to allow you to

2816
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,119
bring that in instead of using our

2817
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:30,159
default visualizations

2818
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:32,400
so that hopefully was a

2819
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,639
review of what i went over last time and

2820
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:37,360
now uh the news is we do actually have

2821
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:40,400
our first spiral of amms complete

2822
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,560
and are ready to release it uh open

2823
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:45,280
source i would say within a month or so

2824
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,880
it's just going through the review

2825
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,960
process at this point

2826
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,440
um i do have it running in the

2827
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,199
background but in the interest of time

2828
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,199
i'll just flip through these

2829
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,280
pictures we have of it so this is our

2830
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,560
welcome screen

2831
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,639
along the top we have a few different

2832
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:02,080
tabs that we want to build out in the

2833
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,280
future

2834
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:05,920
in our current version of amms we have

2835
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,159
built out this monitor tab

2836
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:10,400
the agents tab and the messaging tab and

2837
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,239
i'll go through those in a second

2838
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:14,400
the network tab would show the second

2839
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,600
one there would show like a network

2840
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,800
topology

2841
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,960
um alerts would be alerts from agents

2842
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,639
and system management on the end would

2843
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:22,000
be um

2844
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,199
in the future things like health

2845
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:26,560
monitoring of ams itself

2846
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,679
but going through the ones that we've

2847
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:30,320
built out so the monitor tab this is

2848
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:33,280
showing uh grafana plugins for various

2849
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,320
uh variables within our system so on the

2850
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:39,280
top left you can see this is actually

2851
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,840
uh pulling variables

2852
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,560
from the bp agent full report and

2853
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,320
displaying them in this in this field

2854
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,679
the one we've picked for this one

2855
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:49,679
specifically is num and cust which is

2856
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:51,280
the number of bundles in custody for the

2857
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,560
agent

2858
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,119
so here you can see we've been

2859
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:57,520
getting reports from agent from an agent

2860
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,600
on our network and are able to

2861
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,280
display that variable

2862
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:04,080
for for users of the system

2863
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,600
below that actually in the middle you

2864
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,040
can see all the reports that have come

2865
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,360
in in kind of their raw form

2866
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:12,239
and then on the top right is the message

2867
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:14,000
group per minute which is really just a

2868
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,320
message rate so how many

2869
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,560
uh you know reports have we gotten in in

2870
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:19,920
the past minute

2871
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:20,880
um

2872
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,320
right now i think in this graphic

2873
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,080
there's only there's only one agent on

2874
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,520
the network but we have run this with

2875
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,719
two and you know you can see the

2876
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,400
difference between the two and

2877
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:29,840
you know compare statistics between

2878
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,880
agents

2879
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,800
so the key here is that it's

2880
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,560
really nice that we can we can now

2881
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,480
display all the different variables from

2882
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,880
all of the reports that you can get

2883
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:39,679
from

2884
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:42,159
you know bp v7 and

2885
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:46,960
uh amp and all the different uh idioms

2886
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:49,360
so next slide is

2887
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,360
oh zooming in on what i just mentioned

2888
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:54,320
so right uh number of bundles in custody

2889
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:55,360
on the

2890
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,080
on the left side and the uh message rate

2891
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:01,519
on the on the right hand side

2892
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,480
but here we have uh the agents tab so

2893
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,159
this one is showing the agents on our

2894
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:07,280
network and this is where we can

2895
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,880
actually control agents so we can send

2896
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,800
them commands and we can uh

2897
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,320
you know receive reports from them as

2898
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:15,600
well

2899
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,920
so at the bottom you manage agents on

2900
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,800
your network if you expand that

2901
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,320
this is what it looks like and this this

2902
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:26,080
may be a little bit small um but the

2903
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,280
rather

2904
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,199
uh cool new feature that we added

2905
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:31,840
recently was that uh you can now

2906
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,239
automatically construct uh

2907
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:36,560
time-based rules here to send to agents

2908
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,760
so if you select um you know start time

2909
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,280
period count

2910
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,440
and then you can pick a report to ask

2911
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,119
the agent to push back

2912
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:47,840
to to your management server

2913
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,600
on the period specified

2914
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,119
then you can you can start populating

2915
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:53,199
data and displaying that in the grafana

2916
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:55,520
pages that i showed previously um so

2917
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,040
right now this is supported for the

2918
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,639
reports that you see on the screen there

2919
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,639
the ltp

2920
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,480
agent enterpoint report the bpage

2921
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,800
endpoint report bp agent full report and

2922
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,719
amp agent full report

2923
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:07,920
but the

2924
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,600
the really nice thing is this allows you

2925
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,880
to send these commands without having to

2926
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,560
get to construct them yourself you don't

2927
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:13,760
have to construct cbore you don't have

2928
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,960
to construct

2929
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:16,000
res

2930
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,400
it just automatically does it for you so

2931
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,080
just an example of some user-friendly

2932
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,800
options coming in the future um the less

2933
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,480
user-friendly way of doing this uh you

2934
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,560
can see below that actually

2935
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,320
you can send raw commands so that other

2936
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,719
text box at the bottom there is

2937
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,159
you can just send the seaboard command

2938
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:33,679
to the agent

2939
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:35,199
and it'll execute that so if you just

2940
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:36,960
wanted a single report

2941
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:40,159
you could construct that command and uh

2942
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:44,000
and send it and receive the report back

2943
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:44,840
on

2944
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,480
the

2945
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,080
so i believe this is my last slide so

2946
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,760
this is the messaging tab

2947
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,679
um the messaging tab right now

2948
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:53,440
uh will help you construct those

2949
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,760
commands if you if you want to send send

2950
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,199
one of your own

2951
01:48:57,199 --> 01:49:00,880
so here if you input a string

2952
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,080
re

2953
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,199
then it'll

2954
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:04,880
parse that out it'll

2955
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,320
show you what the c bar is for that

2956
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,199
string it'll parse it out into json

2957
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:10,320
on the

2958
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,520
there's a tab there that will also

2959
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,520
construct a uml diagram of what it looks

2960
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,679
like and it can do the same for seabor

2961
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,520
as well so if you put in a seabor

2962
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,360
command it'll parse it out and show you

2963
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:22,159
all the same data

2964
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,320
so really quickly that is

2965
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,159
what a ms looks like

2966
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,159
right now in a nutshell um we are really

2967
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:29,199
excited to get this out into the

2968
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:31,599
community and to start getting feedback

2969
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:33,119
um and so hopefully

2970
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,560
it'll be there soon and we'll hear from

2971
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,679
all of you

2972
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:39,239
have any questions

2973
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,480
thank you very much sarah uh

2974
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,239
that's really cool it's really nice to

2975
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:50,000
see this stuff starting to run it's

2976
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,679
really nice to

2977
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:53,440
see this as as slightly more than a

2978
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,800
draft we don't normally do show and

2979
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,960
tells at the itf but this was very very

2980
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,280
worthwhile it's just to demonstrate this

2981
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:01,840
is um this is getting beyond the concept

2982
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,920
phase which is is great so

2983
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:04,880
thank you

2984
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,320
anyone else got any questions on this at

2985
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,080
the moment i know people were asking on

2986
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:09,760
the chat about oh can we play with it

2987
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,719
what's it like and and ed's chimed in to

2988
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:14,159
answer some of that

2989
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:14,960
um

2990
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:16,800
i'm assuming you can hear me

2991
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,960
because i keep getting a pop-up saying

2992
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,679
your audio isn't working

2993
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:22,560
cool

2994
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:24,639
in which case i am going to because i'm

2995
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:25,920
watching the clock i'm going to grab the

2996
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:28,159
slides and i'm going to jump straight on

2997
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:31,119
to my presentation thank you again sarah

2998
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:35,040
um i have a

2999
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,360
very quick

3000
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:40,239
he says in advance um

3001
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:41,440
i'm going to turn my camera on so you

3002
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,599
can see me

3003
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:45,679
so i've got a very shortish presentation

3004
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:47,840
uh asking three questions about endpoint

3005
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,679
ids so um

3006
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:52,080
in classic form i'm still trying to

3007
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,560
chase down um

3008
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:58,080
more detail and drill into uh naming

3009
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,840
uh and addressing but i'm tackling

3010
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,280
naming first

3011
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:04,320
so uh a quick review and i've stolen

3012
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:06,080
this slide from the a similar

3013
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,800
presentation i did at ietf112 so this is

3014
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,679
an analysis of what rfc 9171 tells us

3015
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:14,159
about endpoint ids so the critical thing

3016
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:16,000
is they are a pair

3017
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,159
so that is the schema and then

3018
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:20,239
some content which is defined by that

3019
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:21,360
schema

3020
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:22,239
and

3021
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:24,719
9171 defines

3022
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,360
two schemas the ipn schema and the dtn

3023
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:28,560
schema

3024
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,880
um an important other consideration and

3025
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,159
i'm not going to go into it in too much

3026
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:34,800
depth at the moment because of time is

3027
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,800
there is a multiplicity associated with

3028
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,360
an end point so you can have the the

3029
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:42,320
null endpoint which is is nowhere

3030
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,480
uh you can have unicast endpoints and

3031
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:46,560
you can have multicast endpoints but i'm

3032
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:47,760
not actually going to drill into that

3033
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:49,599
too far in in this talk but it's

3034
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:51,840
something to consider as we discuss the

3035
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,480
various types of schema

3036
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:57,040
so i'm going to ask three questions

3037
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,119
in fact i uh i may even have some

3038
01:51:59,119 --> 01:52:00,560
answers to some of these questions

3039
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:02,400
question one

3040
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:05,520
if the dtn schema is for universal use

3041
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,599
and the reason i say it's for universal

3042
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:09,280
use and i'll jump back one slide because

3043
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,040
i missed this detail

3044
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,080
is that

3045
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,800
the dtn schema

3046
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,400
no it's not on that slide i'll come on

3047
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:20,080
to that the dtn schema in rfc 9171 is

3048
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,560
registered in the iana

3049
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,520
user agent schemas registry

3050
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,679
so that implies that it's for use in

3051
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,960
things like browsers mail agents

3052
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,119
on your mobile phone

3053
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:35,440
generic user agent protocol handlers

3054
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:37,840
that's implied by its registration

3055
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,520
if

3056
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,679
i see you in the queue scott

3057
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:44,239
if the dtn schema is for universal use

3058
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:46,080
how do i write a protocol handler for a

3059
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,920
tool such as curl

3060
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:52,320
uh go on scott i'll bite jump in

3061
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,800
i mean to interrupt you please go ahead

3062
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,800
i was only uh

3063
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,360
i'll respond to the slide before that

3064
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,719
said that there's

3065
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,599
no queuing of multiplicity in these

3066
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:05,440
things and actually there is

3067
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:10,159
the ipm schema is specifically uh always

3068
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:11,840
singleton endpoints

3069
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,480
yes yeah i i think i draw draw that out

3070
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,560
but it's it's it's kind of hit

3071
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,000
that was a kind of a passing point and i

3072
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,119
don't actually want to drill into

3073
01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:21,440
multiplicity too much it was mostly that

3074
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:22,880
slide was stolen from a previous

3075
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,880
presentation and had some points about

3076
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,400
multiplicity but that's

3077
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,719
most relevant at the end but point taken

3078
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,719
so my second question is given the ipn

3079
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,480
schema is restricted and as scott

3080
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:33,840
pointed out you know they're unicast

3081
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,119
only

3082
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:36,560
what should the working group recommend

3083
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:37,840
for its usage

3084
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,840
because it certainly has value it's very

3085
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,159
condensed uh it's very concise et cetera

3086
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:43,440
so i'm going to try and address that oh

3087
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:44,320
i'm going to

3088
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,480
talk around that question and the third

3089
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:48,960
question which both ed and i and various

3090
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:51,920
other people get asked is

3091
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,520
are these two schemas the only two

3092
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,360
schemers out there and

3093
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:56,239
uh

3094
01:53:56,239 --> 01:53:59,599
groups like ccsds uh sana

3095
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:02,560
ipm sig are asking questions such as

3096
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:05,119
well how do we use these dtn ids who

3097
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:06,880
owns the global registry for these

3098
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,639
things can we set up our own global

3099
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:10,960
registry what should we do about problem

3100
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:13,599
x problem y or perceived problem z and

3101
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:15,599
so i also address that

3102
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:17,840
because

3103
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,840
endpoint ids are this combination of

3104
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,080
schema and content and we have only

3105
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,239
currently defined two schemas i shall

3106
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:26,560
answer that as part of question three

3107
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,520
so

3108
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,119
question number one external use of the

3109
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:31,360
dtn schema so as i said before the

3110
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:33,679
schema is registered in the uri schemes

3111
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:35,280
registry which implies they are

3112
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:38,560
available for universal user agents

3113
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:41,199
so my question really is how do i run

3114
01:54:41,199 --> 01:54:43,360
this curl command

3115
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,320
using

3116
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:46,639
curl as an example is great tool but i

3117
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:50,800
want to upload that file to that dtn eid

3118
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,880
so really by doing a bit of analysis

3119
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,560
into that looking at the rules in rfc

3120
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,239
9171

3121
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:57,679
a dtn

3122
01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:01,040
schema specifies a name a slash and then

3123
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:03,599
a demux part which is

3124
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:08,159
some other component so i suggest

3125
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:10,000
that

3126
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
oh sorry that's the next slide so you

3127
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,520
resolve into the name in the demarks

3128
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,080
according to the rules in 91 71 and you

3129
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:16,880
then

3130
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:19,440
transmit that uploaded file content

3131
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,440
using something that you have some

3132
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,040
information you have derived from that

3133
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:25,119
name resolution

3134
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:27,119
9171 quite correctly doesn't say

3135
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,560
anything more about that because it's

3136
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,119
the wrong document to do so

3137
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:33,280
so i propose the following

3138
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,800
and this is contentious and i'm very

3139
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,239
happy for people to step to the mic and

3140
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:37,679
shout but i might ask you to hold for a

3141
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:39,040
second

3142
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,520
when a dtn url is accessed externally

3143
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,360
for example using something like the

3144
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,040
curl tool if someone was to write an

3145
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,880
extension to curl

3146
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:49,040
then the uri is parsed according to the

3147
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,920
rules in 9171 into its name in its dmax

3148
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,920
and this is the contentious bit the name

3149
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:56,719
component is then resolved using global

3150
01:55:56,719 --> 01:55:58,800
using dns not necessarily global could

3151
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:01,840
be local so it's resolved using dns into

3152
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:04,560
an ip address v4 or v6 doesn't make much

3153
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:05,840
difference to me

3154
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,159
and then a tcpl cl a tcp clv4 session is

3155
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:12,480
established to that resolved address in

3156
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:15,839
order to transmit the bundle

3157
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,760
example

3158
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,520
that curl command

3159
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,840
takes

3160
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,199
performs the following operations it's

3161
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:27,599
saying send that bundle protocol version

3162
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:29,840
7 bundle with the content of file1 as

3163
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:32,320
payload to that destination which is

3164
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:34,199
schema type 1

3165
01:56:34,199 --> 01:56:35,760
dtn.org

3166
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,840
some service in some services the dmx

3167
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:42,400
part using a tcp lcr the tcpclv4 session

3168
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,400
i'm going to make that acronym shorter

3169
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:46,320
to the agent at that resolved address

3170
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:47,599
please don't ping that address i'm not

3171
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:49,199
entirely sure where it is

3172
01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:51,119
um obviously you'll need some other

3173
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:53,119
options to set some of the primary block

3174
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:56,000
headers but fundamentally that is enough

3175
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,760
to start using

3176
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:59,360
bundle protocol

3177
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:02,239
on the public internet infrastructure in

3178
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:05,519
order to send messages

3179
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:08,800
a couple of clarifications this proposal

3180
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:11,599
does not prevent either of the following

3181
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:13,679
if you if your bundle processing agent

3182
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:15,599
is not something

3183
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:18,080
internet focused such as curl but is

3184
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,440
some

3185
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,119
system built into a traditional dtn

3186
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:22,639
environment so a deep space probe or

3187
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:24,560
something in a ground station or

3188
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,480
something traditional like that doesn't

3189
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,239
make any difference

3190
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:30,320
you can resolve that however you wish

3191
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,239
you can use

3192
01:57:32,239 --> 01:57:34,080
intermediate proxies and gateways

3193
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,840
between the user agent and that

3194
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:40,480
tcpcl or and that endpoint id that one

3195
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,880
might use tcpcl to get to so there's

3196
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:45,040
nothing to stop you doing that at the

3197
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:46,400
ingress stage

3198
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,800
and there's equally nothing to say

3199
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:52,639
that demux part of the endpoint id after

3200
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:55,360
the dns resolved part of the name

3201
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,360
that could actually be an ipn address or

3202
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,360
it could be some other

3203
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:02,560
deeper into the dtn network beyond the

3204
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,520
dns resolved part so that dns resolve

3205
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:07,360
part is simply saying

3206
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,040
here is something

3207
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,520
that is resolvable to an ip address that

3208
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:14,800
can be contacted using tcpclv4

3209
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,800
that will take that bundle and get it to

3210
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:21,560
wherever it finally needs to get to

3211
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:23,520
okay i'm just going to quickly pause at

3212
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,280
that point to see if anyone has any

3213
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,719
major arguments

3214
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:28,719
go for it arguments but rick just

3215
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:30,719
because we have two minutes left

3216
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,239
oh shut up

3217
01:58:32,239 --> 01:58:34,000
well what i would suggest is that this

3218
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,280
is of course something we need to

3219
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:37,679
address uh can we start some posts on

3220
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,440
the mailing list and perhaps uh

3221
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,520
entertain an interim meeting to jump

3222
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,840
into some of these topics in more detail

3223
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:45,840
yes absolutely i'm quite happy to take

3224
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,239
that to the list uh what i'll do is i'll

3225
01:58:48,239 --> 01:58:50,159
skip very quickly over the second slide

3226
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:52,639
and leave it on the third joshua

3227
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:53,520
thanks

3228
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,040
let's finish up because we're pretty

3229
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:55,840
close

3230
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:58,239
yeah okay ipn scheme i am proposing that

3231
01:58:58,239 --> 01:59:01,199
it is used internally for uh

3232
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:03,679
autonomous regions that's got introduced

3233
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:05,840
so it's effectively a like a landscaped

3234
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,000
address and this is an important slide

3235
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,400
for the ipn sig guys i have pointed them

3236
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:12,320
at this before if you wanted to find

3237
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:13,679
your only id

3238
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:16,400
this is how you do it document it

3239
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:18,560
request a new bundle protocol uri type

3240
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:19,920
scheme number

3241
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,080
you're there you're compliant

3242
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:25,199
so that's it i'll stop

3243
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,320
uh ed you have about 20 seconds i'm

3244
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:32,080
really sorry that's fine why don't you

3245
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,760
project the slide i'll ask a question

3246
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:34,880
and then we'll take it to the mailing

3247
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:36,719
list which i think is appropriate

3248
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:38,639
and the the question uh really the

3249
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:40,480
fundamental question that i have is uh

3250
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:42,880
in going back and looking at rfc 4838

3251
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:45,840
which was published in april of 2007 uh

3252
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:47,520
based on and seeing some of the work in

3253
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:49,119
dtn rg

3254
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:51,360
we laid out what the dtn architecture is

3255
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,360
i well i didn't but the d10 architecture

3256
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,440
was laid out in in this way

3257
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:58,159
my question uh to the working group is

3258
01:59:58,159 --> 02:00:00,560
do we feel that our implementation

3259
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:04,000
experience with bpv6 changes to bpv7 and

3260
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,239
some of the work that's happening now uh

3261
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:08,800
with uh network management with security

3262
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,719
with quality of service with custody

3263
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:13,360
transfer and so on is it time to refresh

3264
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:14,960
this document

3265
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,639
and that is a

3266
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:18,639
question out to the working group for

3267
02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:20,880
anyone that wants to simply make a

3268
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,280
statement here about it or take opinions

3269
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,599
as to whether we need to refresh 4838 to

3270
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:28,239
the mailing list

3271
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,080
that's really all i have on this slide

3272
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:37,440
and

3273
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:40,480
with that we are at the two hour mark

3274
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:43,119
i just like to say this is wonderful to

3275
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:45,520
have the first dtm working group meeting

3276
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,760
after having our first four rfcs uh

3277
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:49,760
published there's a tremendous amount of

3278
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:51,599
work as you can see we really did run

3279
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:53,360
out of time quite quickly

3280
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,840
and we should start we should start

3281
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,080
planning an interim meeting uh now and

3282
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,480
then also perhaps have additional time

3283
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:04,400
at the next uh ietf 114 which perhaps

3284
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:08,119
will be all in person

3285
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:12,000
but i also add thank you very much uh

3286
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
all the contributors uh thank you very

3287
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,639
much for attendees um i'm going to keep

3288
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:18,960
talking and communicating on chat until

3289
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,880
meet echo shut us down because we're so

3290
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:23,520
compressed uh ed and i were talking

3291
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:24,960
offline i think we're going to ask for

3292
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:27,119
two sessions next time because we always

3293
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:29,599
seem to run out of time although we are

3294
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:31,360
on paper quite a small group there's a

3295
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:32,960
huge list of there's a huge set of

3296
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,719
attendees on here

3297
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:36,719
a lot of remote participants and i think

3298
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:38,800
we have more work we can do

3299
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,520
uh at the the next atf as well as in

3300
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:42,560
between

3301
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,400
so thank you very much for your

3302
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:48,598
attendance and your good questions

3303
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:52,880
so uh yeah i i'm i'm still typing

3304
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,239
rapidly in the chat but i'm going to

3305
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:57,119
close my mic uh thank you very much uh i

3306
02:01:57,119 --> 02:02:00,080

3308
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:03,920
it's good to see everyone i will be

3309
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:06,719
grabbing the uh chat window uh at the

3310
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:10,080
very last second and throughout there is

3311
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:11,360
code emd

3312
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:14,239

3315
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,239
minute since they were going past great

3316

stuff as usual those will be published

3317

02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:30,000
into a

3321
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,880
a youtube video much to my embarrassment

3322
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:35,199
um at some later dates so you can listen

3323
