1
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,440
this man

2
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,600
we should decide where we're going

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,960
because we only have an hour

4
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,480
last time no of course no i think it's

5
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,718
fine

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,400
it's fine enough

7
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,960
okay

8
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,840
fine

9
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
so we are already at the top of the hour

10
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,479

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
itf

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,680
event

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,640
okay yeah i hope everybody is now well

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,720
as last said it with the unreadable note

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,319
well there's a lot of

36
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,879
things in here i think most apparently

37
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,319
please uh

38
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,280
uh read the bcp 54

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
and 78 and 79.

40
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,840
it's a code of conduct and whatever you

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,879
say here basically can go into the

42
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,879
iit society's uh

43
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,360
ipr pool so there's a notebook here

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
about information also i think important

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,040
to highlight is uh bcp25

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,879
i think it's kind of obvious but i want

47
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,080
to restate

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
be nice

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,599
if you want to be treated nice i think

50
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
that hasn't been a big problem here but

51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
you don't never know what happens in the

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,200
background thank you

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,959
and so uh um that's about bcp 25.

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,599
so yeah this is a hybrid meeting

55
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,760
in person participants should raise

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,319
their hand with the tool so if you have

57
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,879
a device with you and you can join the

58
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,640
meet echo

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,560
you can get in line because there are

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
now virtually two lines you are the

61
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,040
physical inline and the actual line it

62
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
makes more sense for us uh if you raise

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
your hand so can we can see the sequence

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,439
between virtual people going into the

65
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,799
mic and the physical attendees

66
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,280
going to the mic so that really helps us

67
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,599
but we will also try to take track of

68
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,159
people who can't raise their hand

69
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,920
in the room here so

70
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,799
um

71
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,480
anyone who is not

72
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,799
actually participating in discussion is

73
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,080
advised to mute their mic

74
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,439
i'm not so

75
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,600
strongly averse at seeing everybody but

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,279
if there's 20 people on the screen it's

77
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,519
also confusing so maybe just turn on

78
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,680
your video when you speak up please

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,120
so in general the logistics um i think

80
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
the agenda is pretty obvious

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,720
um i think the most important thing is

82
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
if you have a problem with all of this

83
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,040
and find out it might not be me it might

84
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,080
be the system um there's an issue link

85
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,840
down at the bottom of this slide please

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,040
report

87
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,479
uh to increase the quality of the

88
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,240
experience for everyone i think that's

89
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,759
very appreciated especially if uh

90
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,520
yeah it's a recurring problem for you

91
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,840
so as i already said alexey hi

92
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,120
hi i'm hank

93
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,000
and now comes the very important part we

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
need minute takers

95
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
so because we will talk about things and

96
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,800
there's a link here

97
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
on the

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
slide there's a link in the agenda it

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,560
has a little notebook page and a pen on

100
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,960
it if you click on it you get redirected

101
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,199
to a kodi md

102
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,600
that's where the minutes are taken so

103
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,199
what we need here right now is a minute

104
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,960
taker at least one

105
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,479
preferably two

106
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,840
and this is a hard blocker on the

107
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,800
session and michael thank you

108
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,039
do we get a second one like a fallback

109
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,960
four bags don't have as much

110
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,720
responsibility they just have to take

111
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
care that michael is doing this

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,280
yeah

113
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,639
presenting for example because i think

114
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,400
he will be the first presenter so we

115
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,520
need a second

116
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,080
note taker please

117
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,240
they may be in the room they may be in

118
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,520
the meat echo virtual attendee list

119
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,199
that doesn't matter as long as you can

120
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,319
click the kodi md link

121
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,680
ah

122
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
alex is mumbling to me that he might be

123
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,520
compensating for the lack of attendee

124
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
volunteerism but i still want this given

125
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,960
the next 30 minutes uh maybe seconds

126
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,600
anybody up

127
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
and awake

128
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
yeah some people might not be as awake

129
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,520
than others

130
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,319
okay if you want to follow the

131
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,800
discussions you will click at the note

132
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
uh anyway because typically people

133
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
follow the notes if you think something

134
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,639
has been written down incorrectly just

135
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,199
correct that that makes you a support

136
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,680
notetaker so alexia unfortunately now

137
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,720
has

138
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,400
a second note-taking

139
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
duty um yeah again the meet echo link

140
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,880
apparently you found if you're in this

141
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,039
meeting it's on the bottom of the slide

142
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,440
and then we can go to the

143
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,039
content next slide please

144
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,919
so we're going to have a full agenda but

145
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,319
it is not as full as we have field

146
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,639
because we have a two hour slot so there

147
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,639
will be time for discussion

148
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,280
and that will be of benefit to

149
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,160
the whole endeavor so uh yeah i'm not

150
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
going through all the items here you can

151
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,479
see michael's first kieran you had she

152
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,800
has presented last time pierre is new

153
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
and i think i think would be very

154
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,919
interesting to see about the future

155
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,639
proof next slide

156
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,880
so we have a a

157
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,319
new newbie

158
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,400
this iot ops

159
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,919
working group is intended to be a

160
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,479
landing site for people coming from the

161
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,759
outside of the ietf with a problem with

162
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,199
the navigation

163
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,520
within the navigator missing and now we

164
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,599
want to take over some navigator duty

165
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,560
here i think and then uh last but not

166
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
least the hunters will tell us about the

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
dts 1.3 profile for iot i think that

168
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
would be very interesting for most of us

169
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,360
and then we want to go into the rest of

170
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,599
the time and we don't have to notice all

171
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,720
the time but hopefully most of it uh to

172
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,879
talk about a working group deliverable

173
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,199
we started that discussion last time but

174
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,120
i think we've came closer to that and we

175
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
will actually have some slides on that

176
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,319
so uh

177
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,639
well uh first in line first and

178
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,800
presentation line is uh

179
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
michael and so you're now free of minute

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
duty

181
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,440
and

182
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,719
the microphone is yours

183
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,959
the most sophisticated scenario

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,720
so this yeah that's the one uh how do i

185
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,399
actually pause control

186
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,160
you go to my name

187
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,199
and you hover

188
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,399
many names that's nice to see yeah

189
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,080
cover to the right no that's the wrong

190
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,440
one because that's probably the main

191
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,839
blogs in the jabber look for another one

192
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,519
without the spade with the space of the

193
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,519
name

194
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,120
get into the box michael we will do this

195
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,000
for you

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,519
all right um

197
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,800
that's good

198
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
let's tell you next slide

199
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,440
yeah you just i'll just ask you for the

200
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,000
next slide

201
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,800
yeah we pass it over to your java

202
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,240
account that doesn't matter

203
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,160
well you can't pass it but

204
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,360
that's the one that's probably showing

205
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,160
up

206
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,360
okay

207
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
all right so i'm here to this is a

208
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,640
follow-up for uh to uh uh

209
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,600
talk that nick gave um

210
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
the last ietf um

211
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,920
so i'm involved in a uk group called the

212
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,519
iot security foundation um

213
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,200
it's an interesting

214
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,920
uh group a little bit uh in the scale of

215
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,600
you know ietf to uh complete marketing

216
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,000
it's uh probably about here

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,800
okay so you know not not some real

218
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,600
technical issues but not as technical as

219
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,959
itf

220
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,480
and uh

221
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,959
uh it's created a working group called

222
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,480
many secured

223
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,399
and within that there's an effort called

224
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
the secure usable internet browser or

225
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,760
browsing maybe

226
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,560
um

227
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
and so um

228
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,959
we came to you last time with the

229
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,560
problem statement next slide please

230
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
um i'll just mention that uh not only

231
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,320
christians in the room but christian is

232
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,240
an ietfer that got dragged into this and

233
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,519
some of these other people are coming

234
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,279
from other directions

235
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,519
so what is the problem

236
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,519
uh we'd like to be able to

237
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,920
browse securely to the devices in your

238
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,720
home

239
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,079
be they printers refrigerators or

240
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,800
thermostats uh whatever

241
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,880
things in your home

242
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,079
so https everywhere that's the goal

243
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,480
or maybe some other other security if

244
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
someone has it

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,600
and the problem is that well devices

246
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
they don't have names and they don't

247
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,720
have certificates and if they did have

248
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,800
certificates the certificates content

249
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
don't match

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
the ip address that you probably have to

251
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,760
use to reach them

252
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
and

253
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,279
that's the problem um

254
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,360
and so today i'm going to talk a little

255
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
bit about

256
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,880
uh some of the solutions that we have

257
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
thought about um one of the interesting

258
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,920
things that's kind of un surprising is

259
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,240
that when we talked about this last time

260
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
uh the jabber room erupted in basically

261
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,000
comments of well this is an easy problem

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,519
okay you just need to color it with a

263
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,279
brown pencil and there'll be no issues

264
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,279
right and the answer is well that's

265
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,200
great but unfortunately brown pencils

266
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,360
are not available you know in this

267
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,040
contact store there's a lot of

268
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,240
interesting things so i actually would

269
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,920
encourage you i had to dig around for

270
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,839
the jabra logs i would encourage you to

271
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,120
go back and read what you know

272
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,480
30 intelligent people came up with in 20

273
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
seconds uh to figure out what to do and

274
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
what what some of the issues are behind

275
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,680
them

276
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
um

277
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,480
we uh this group is open to

278
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,920
uh

279
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,000
outside participants you don't need to

280
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
be a member but

281
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,279
it's a little bit more closed in the itf

282
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,120
unfortunately so we do need to invite

283
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,959
you but uh you'll be very welcome if you

284
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,399
want to do that

285
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,720
um and i'll just say that

286
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,480
a tuesday was it tuesday was six man um

287
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,680
you know there's the question as to

288
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,399
whether or not you can even talk uh put

289
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,200
an ipv6 link local address in your

290
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
browser bar and the answer is you can't

291
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,360
right now um but as soon as you can do

292
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
that of course the next statement is i'd

293
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
like it to be secure

294
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,800
and so this is a bit above that as well

295
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,279
next slide please

296
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,079
so

297
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,399
i have a bunch of slides that uh start

298
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,040
with hack because i'm going to say that

299
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,120
none of those solutions are particularly

300
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
perfect okay so

301
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,839
the first version is you know what

302
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,200
um

303
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,279
there isn't really a problem

304
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,120
uh the problem is that the warning that

305
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,680
the browser puts up is so scary that

306
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,519
most people won't click through it so

307
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,800
the question is

308
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,359
um if we could make that that

309
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
warning

310
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,279
look a little less scary

311
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,160
such that people when it's a link local

312
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,399
address so an rfc 1918 that's directly

313
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,639
connected or ula that's directly

314
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,880
connected so you know if you're on 192

315
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,279
168 you know 1.1

316
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,800
um and it's on 172 16 well that's not

317
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
directly connected it's somewhere else

318
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
on some other network right so the one

319
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,399
that's physically plugged into your

320
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,440
computer

321
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
if you go there

322
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,360
the idea is that the browser won't give

323
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,040
you quite so

324
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,120
such a heart attack okay and will allow

325
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,240
you to essentially accept the

326
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,040
certificate for this device

327
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,120
put it somewhere safe it's essentially a

328
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,240
trust

329
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
trust on first use

330
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,120
and

331
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
that's about it

332
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,240
and this is the simplest one but it's

333
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,320
also the simplest conceptually but it's

334
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
probably also the most difficult

335
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,240
politically to get to make happen we

336
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
basically would have to convince the ca

337
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,279
browser forum to to create such a an

338
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,279
exception and the browser makers to

339
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,160
actually

340
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,199
um

341
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,120
you know be willing to deploy this and

342
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,680
of course there's a lot of ui and other

343
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,839
issues there that we'd have to talk

344
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,279
about next slide please

345
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,519
so

346
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,600
this is in some ways the most brilliant

347
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,040
of them all

348
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,959
um and

349
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,000
uh christian and moose has actually

350
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,839
emphasis has actually

351
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,760
uh implemented some of this and came up

352
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
with some of these this stuff

353
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,240
uh a little bit independently and then

354
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,839
we discovered that there were three or

355
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,160
four iot vendors that are actually doing

356
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,600
this right now because you don't

357
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,880
actually need any permission and of

358
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,040
course this is the best part of

359
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
of permissionless innovation is the lack

360
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,959
of permission

361
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,199
um so basically the device leaves the

362
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,440
factory with a certificate that has a

363
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,000
wild card in it so an example here you

364
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,519
have star dot you know fo crypto 1d

365
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,399
and

366
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,680
it's rooted somewhere in the

367
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,320
manufacturer's dns zone

368
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,560
and there's an http server that you

369
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,480
connect to http not s at the moment and

370
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,160
it redirects you to this link right

371
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,240
and uh when you look up that name you

372
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,360
discover it returns

373
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,199
192.168.0.1 which was the ip address of

374
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,880
the device

375
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
um and you might notice that the hex

376
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
part in there maps directly to that

377
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,720
address and so in fact the dns server

378
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
isn't keeping any state or any wonderful

379
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,240
stuff uh whatever whatever query it sees

380
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,399
it turns around you know

381
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,800
uh removes the hex and says well it must

382
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,360
be at that address and returns it

383
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
um it's actually out there

384
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,240
um you may know if you run open wrt this

385
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,320
isn't going to work

386
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,959
um it will in fact filter out any

387
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,440
replies that have rfc 19 addresses in

388
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,079
them in it it will not filter filter out

389
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,440
ula so yay ipv6 or

390
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,519
maybe the other side of it is

391
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,440
unfortunately openwrt doesn't know how

392
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,560
to do security for ipv6 so the attack is

393
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,720
otherwise that that

394
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
systems or browser

395
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
javascript will go and scan your network

396
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
using your browser

397
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,759
but this is out there and it's kind of a

398
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,720
cool hack in many ways

399
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,959
because it's relatively stateless

400
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,720
the vendor does have to be involved and

401
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
doesn't have to run a service but other

402
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,199
than mapping the ip address the name to

403
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,160
the ip address which is just dns

404
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,760
the vendor is not involved at all

405
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,919
there's no call home um it's cashable um

406
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,839
and

407
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,559
conceivably

408
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,439
you know

409
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,280
someone could even put up us if the

410
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,039
vendor died someone else could put up a

411
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,520
service or you could stuff that number

412
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,039
into your

413
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,320
uh local

414
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,799
uh open wrt hosts file or something like

415
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,880
that if the vendor is truly dead next

416
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,440
slide please

417
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,760
oh please ask questions and please

418
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,919
interrupt me if something is unclear um

419
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,760
there

420
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
so

421
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,919
in this version it looks very similar

422
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,679
the difference is that there's no wild

423
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,400
card it's just a regular address

424
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,320
and the important part is that when the

425
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,880
device boots calls home and basically

426
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,360
tells the vendor i seem to be at ip

427
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,799
address

428
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,080
you know

429
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
10.1.1.1

430
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,200
could you put that in my dns please

431
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
and uh

432
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,880
the vendor does that and

433
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,559
now it's really just

434
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,840
bog standard dns we can do this with rc

435
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,120
3000

436
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,760
sorry 3007 which is the dns update

437
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,400
protocol and or you could use a wide

438
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
variety of you know proprietary hp http

439
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,400
based ones which if you have ever done

440
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
anything you know called you know

441
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,000
dynamic dns or whatever

442
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
then it's exactly that's exactly the

443
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
problem um

444
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,559
and we don't really need standardization

445
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,039
because it's between the device and

446
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,200
its cloud component um

447
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,000
and it could be whatever okay

448
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,160
does require more state so there has to

449
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
be a database at the vendor

450
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,039
of mapping names of devices to local ip

451
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,080
addresses

452
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,720
and if that state that dies or

453
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,559
disappears then the device has to figure

454
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,160
out when to renew it

455
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,679
um and

456
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,640
um

457
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,080
you know of course the vendor has to

458
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,280
continue to exist and serve that name

459
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,799
of course that can be outsourced this

460
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,240
would be much easier to outsource than

461
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,320
the previous system it's just a zone

462
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,400
with updates

463
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,840
um

464
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,600
it's unclear if anyone's doing this yet

465
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,320
for https but we know that this happens

466
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,960
all the time with with other with uh

467
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,080
otherwise um and people do this you know

468
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
on their own systems they put up a

469
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,679
raspberry pi they they do a w get blah

470
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,120
blah blah they get their outer ip

471
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,039
address with a port map and they get a

472
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,720
let's encrypt certificate and people do

473
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,000
this certainly uh you know engineers do

474
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
this tech easily the point is we're

475
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,000
trying to make this doable for

476
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,799
light bulbs and refrigerators

477
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,360
next slide please

478
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,320
so

479
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,760
this is getting a little bit further

480
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,200
away from being trivial okay

481
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,280
um in this situation

482
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,960
the the device is onboarded using well

483
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,880
right now people wind up with you know

484
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,280
an lg app for your lg refrigerator and a

485
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
samsung app for your samsung

486
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
refrigerator and all this kind of stuff

487
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
and uh the way that it works now is that

488
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,240
if there's any security it's all private

489
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,039
so the idea though here is that um we

490
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,960
will move towards having

491
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,679
um a kind of app or a skill which is the

492
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,520
word that the intelligent speaker people

493
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,880
use to describe an app um that interacts

494
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,440
with the app the device

495
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,280
does the onboarding and that process

496
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,960
collects some kind of a certificate

497
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
signing request

498
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
and enrolls the device perhaps into what

499
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,200
is probably a private pki

500
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,159
and

501
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,640
um this is you know there's existing

502
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,640
practice rfc or my rfc 8995 does

503
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,880
essentially this the chip matter uh

504
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
effort is doing essentially the same

505
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,200
thing um uh dpp could do this and there

506
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,720
are other efforts out there that

507
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,039
basically are saying okay we're gonna

508
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,000
somehow bring the the onboard the device

509
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
and we'll give it a certificate and a

510
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,919
name a locally relevant name while we do

511
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
that

512
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,960
um

513
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
if you do this in this simplest and

514
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,400
stupidest way

515
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,080
your phone is going to onboard the

516
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,840
device your phone will know the name and

517
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,760
the the the

518
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,600
certificate and have the trust anchor of

519
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,760
the device and that'll be it and so then

520
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
you go to your desktop and you're like

521
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,360
oh well the device is not secure and i

522
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,799
don't even know the name

523
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,720
well so that's a problem so the question

524
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,840
and the challenge in this thing

525
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,080
essentially is if i do this and i want

526
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,840
to do this how do i propagate this

527
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
information throughout the home

528
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,200
um and that's an unsolved problem but

529
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,080
it may not be that complicated a problem

530
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,880
right it's just you know some kind of a

531
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,280
trust anchor discovery protocol that

532
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,320
runs on

533
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,240
multicast sounds like something to me

534
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,720
that would fit into a dns sd or

535
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,120
something like this and maybe actually

536
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,360
would be doable as a browser extension

537
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
or something like this and that would

538
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
let basically let you get the local

539
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,720
local trust anchors and uh name service

540
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,760
for that

541
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,320
next slide please

542
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,360
so

543
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,200
same thing but we're not doing it from

544
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,559
your phone

545
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,240
your gateway would do this and now we're

546
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,320
getting to okay this really does need to

547
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,080
be some kind of a standard the gateway

548
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,679
would we involve

549
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,480
as i said chip matter brewski they do

550
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,080
this and running it in the gateway makes

551
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,760
a lot of sense but since it's the

552
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,000
gateway involved we can also imagine

553
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,480
that somehow dhcp is involved or lldp or

554
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,919
some other kinds of things that could

555
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,120
work for this

556
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
um but

557
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,159
basically we're now into a state of

558
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,240
where the device this is really a proper

559
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,400
onboarding the device really has to be

560
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,559
involved in this this is not just a kind

561
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,760
of a

562
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,559
hack around the edges um that gets us

563
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,640
something there

564
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,159
so these are the three the four things

565
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,480
that we we've detailed a great deal the

566
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,120
links that i put up there uh are to our

567
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
documents there

568
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,159
um

569
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,960
they're all in uh markdown and

570
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,840
dockasaurus uh if you want to comment on

571
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,320
them that would be wonderful and that's

572
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,159
really it for for me from today next

573
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,480
slide

574
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,559
so i want you to think about you know

575
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,480
you are in a you're imagine you're in a

576
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,520
field and there's a nice cool toy nearby

577
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,799
and you have your phone you should be

578
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,400
able to securely reach out to it and

579
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,080
control it right without going to the

580
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,400
cloud that would be my ideal

581
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
right

582
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,400
any questions any comments from the

583
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,360
yes brandon

584
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,919
so what i've noticed through all of this

585
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,720
is that in each case whatever the

586
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,679
mechanism it is that you use to get

587
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,520
the trust anchor into your um consume

588
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,799
well into your

589
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,080
device

590
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,960
uh that's ambiguous sorry into you your

591
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,159
browser

592
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,320
um is also an attack surface

593
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,559
and i haven't seen anything so far in

594
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,360
this

595
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,600
uh no that's not true um one of them the

596
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,760
two of them were all right uh but the

597
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,799
the two that use conventional pki

598
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,039
uh wind up broadcasting a whole bunch of

599
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,880
information about your network

600
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,600
into a vendor-controlled dns

601
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,640
and the others open a new attack surface

602
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,440
for

603
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
someone to try and break into your

604
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,520
network so i guess

605
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
i i wonder if there's something that we

606
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,400
can do

607
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,000
that sort of splits the difference and

608
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,799
doesn't have both of these problems

609
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,400
that's an interesting question brendan

610
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
um and you're exactly right i'm just

611
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,600
going to kind of repeat it

612
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,240
back to the room and to you so the first

613
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,120
two involve some kind of address ip

614
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,480
address information

615
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,000
being shared with the vendor or the

616
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,320
vendors dns server but the trust tankers

617
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
can come from the normal trust anchors

618
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,600
because the vendor

619
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,080
either has uh

620
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,840
has allocated certificates with the

621
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,480
right names already into uh you know the

622
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,039
public web pki or it's going to do so

623
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,840
you know lists less with uh with acme at

624
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
runtime um

625
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,320
uh so there's no trust issue but as you

626
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,880
say you're now sharing stuff with ip

627
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,200
addresses but that's about it with the

628
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,880
vendor and the other mechanisms of

629
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,039
course now involve as you say

630
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,720
there's now some new anchors that you

631
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,279
need to rely on and if you rely on new

632
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,120
anchors and new name spaces then what

633
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,880
you're saying is that anyone could

634
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,720
possibly insert new anchors and new name

635
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,200
spaces did i get that right brendan

636
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,600
uh yeah absolutely i mean there's a look

637
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
in the the naive solution that you

638
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
presented on slide three there's

639
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
it's a relatively trivial attack if

640
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,440
someone has physical access to your

641
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,279
network to get you to connect to things

642
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,760
they shouldn't so i mean that that opens

643
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,919
the the door for

644
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,760
malicious implants and things like that

645
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,480
so you know i i really wouldn't support

646
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,640
that one it's quite dangerous

647
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,960
okay

648
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,240
eric

649
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,000
yeah sorry i can't log in i don't have

650
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,760
my laptop this morning which is why i'm

651
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,240
not there hey eric not mark

652
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,120
um

653
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,159
so

654
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,240
the other place this happens similar

655
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
things is in these enterprise onboarding

656
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,039
things where they need to give you some

657
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,080
certificate to trust some root ca

658
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,760
please add it to your keychain type

659
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,159
thing right yes and have you looked at

660
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,760
those mechanisms as well because i don't

661
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,600
remember exactly how complicated they

662
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,960
are it's been a while since i've done

663
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,000
this but

664
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,919
and it's basically saying i'm trusting

665
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,320
whatever you gave me over http or over a

666
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,600
qr code

667
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,320
to be a trust anchor right however i

668
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,000
found that for my device so there's

669
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,039
there's i i so at this point i would say

670
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,000
that the enterprise base is not not rich

671
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,039
in in lots of experience with them um

672
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,679
but that effectively um

673
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,679
brewski for instance is intended as an

674
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,200
enterprise solution for instance and

675
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
there's other mechanisms like that um

676
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,919
that and one of the features of them

677
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,200
though is because

678
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,679
they're because of the they are intended

679
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,200
as an enterprise solution there's an

680
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,480
assumption that the enterprise is

681
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,720
capable of running a pki

682
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,120
and is capable of

683
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
uh communicating those trust anchors

684
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,760
securely to their desktops

685
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,240
right so the typical enterprise you know

686
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,480
sticks a new trust anchor into microsoft

687
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,080
whatever it's called uh

688
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,960
group policy and then everyone trusts it

689
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,440
and so that part that side of the trust

690
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,760
problem is solved right but i think

691
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,360
there's other things where here's

692
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,880
something that you know your iphone

693
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,279
picks up or your laptop

694
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,720
i don't know if i did this with linux

695
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,960
but what basically says here's something

696
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,559
that you need to add to your trusted

697
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
root case right so that we can do tls

698
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
and man in the middle

699
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,640
yeah yeah there's there's there's

700
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,720
absolutely you can you can download

701
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,320
there's a mime type right and your

702
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,399
browser sees that it will say you know

703
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,080
it'll put it up and say do you wish to

704
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,520
trust it right

705
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
and and that's still there i think in

706
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,679
almost all the browsers it's still there

707
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,320
uh but in some cases it's it's

708
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,640
it's uh it can be turned off

709
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,440
or

710
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,039
like enterprises would like to turn that

711
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,200
off and they control it

712
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
or

713
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,120
the user is

714
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,799
simply decides they're inc they're not

715
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,799
competent to make the decision

716
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,880
and so they'll always say no and it's

717
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,399
probably good that we training them to

718
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,559
always say no because we don't want them

719
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,320
to gratuitously adding them trust

720
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,080
anchors right and you're trusting it for

721
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,120
everything it's supposed to be that's

722
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,720
right and there's no name path

723
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,080
constraints or anything like that

724
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,440
usually on it and that's actually what

725
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,880
we need tourists uh todd zeckert um so

726
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,120
the one thing we eliminated in enema is

727
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,840
the

728
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,760
this this really terrible you know um

729
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
pre-deployment location thingy yes in in

730
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
a large environment uh like an

731
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,399
enterprise or so is is really a large

732
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,480
cost factor on the other hand if i

733
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,640
understood maybe i misunderstood the uh

734
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,720
the scope of where this is meant to go

735
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,279
to like in the home or so yeah we're

736
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,279
always physically handling these devices

737
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,279
so i was wondering if um

738
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,880
bringing that option in there because it

739
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,000
was never

740
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,159
there there never was this option

741
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,399
in the home that you have a secured

742
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,000
location like the

743
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
trusted ethernet port where you know

744
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
what you're plugging into you'd have no

745
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,600
external network connectivity but only

746
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,760
your enrollment equipment and then your

747
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,159
brand brand that equipment to you maybe

748
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,399
that bringing that idea you know into

749
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,880
the home could help as a solution

750
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,840
component here i think that's that's a a

751
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,799
great a great suggestion um you know go

752
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,679
to the

753
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,679
the bathroom down the hall on the second

754
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,559
floor

755
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,440
and plug in the device first you know um

756
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,200
and it's not a place where anyone else

757
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,440
goes you don't you know or if they do

758
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,120
then they're already in but i think

759
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,240
that's a brilliant thing the problem is

760
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,520
that of course we have devices that

761
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,000
don't have ethernets well with the wi-fi

762
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,320
you have you know as the master of the

763
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
house of course also the

764
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,640
key for the one ssid which has exactly

765
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,200
the same property right so yes the the

766
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,279
issue is in most cases is how do you

767
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,880
convince the device

768
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,960
that it's supposed to do that right now

769
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,440
and very much the matter effort um i

770
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,840
think is is is in that direction and

771
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,279
they even have i don't know 27 codes

772
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,600
to say which combination of buttons

773
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,720
you're supposed to push to put the

774
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,960
device in that mode

775
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,360
and to doing that so so that's kind of

776
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,919
there but the result of that effort is

777
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,600
that the device is enrolled into your

778
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,000
private pki

779
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,600
true but i mean if we start talking

780
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,200
about the wi-fi devices as you said

781
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,799
they're they're all type of crappy you

782
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,080
know but very often we use things like

783
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,480
device opens up its own access point so

784
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,720
it's discoverable by other devices and

785
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,640
so on so i mean i think that's a longer

786
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,960
discussion it's called soft ap now and

787
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,760
apparently it's there's patents on it

788
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,600
people are not happy but

789
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,960
anyway i think i've used too much time

790
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,679
already

791
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,679
yes i would like to remind everybody if

792
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,120
you can

793
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,760
be physically in the room before you go

794
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,840
to the mic i know eric you don't have an

795
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,159
equipment with you but press the uh

796
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,960
raise hand button please

797
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,360
yeah next up should be uh

798

welcome thank you

801
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,760

is wonderful

803
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,039

but i hate myself

805
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,399
yeah these are not my slides

806
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,039
oh yeah

807
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,679
definitely

808
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,840
and i can shut up

809
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,360
and i can shut up

810
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,440
sometimes i love this echo

811
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,559
sometimes i love this echo

812
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,600
for me

813
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,440
i just

814
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,039
uh good morning everyone

815
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,600
i'm kieran i wrote this document along

816
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,840
with my colleague lejeune at

817
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,880
huawei

818
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,120
and we are going to talk about how to

819
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,440
support and realize virtualization of

820
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,799
plc's in industry network

821
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,720
this is built on document we presented

822
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,320
last time and

823
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
pretty much everything has changed about

824
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,760
that document and a lot of it was driven

825
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,080
by the motivation that

826
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,399
problem statement or what we were trying

827
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,399
to solve with our

828
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,960
framework document wasn't very clear so

829
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,840
what we tried to do was

830
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,640
pull out a very specific portion of

831
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,120
virtual plc and build the use case

832
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,399
around it

833
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,880
so some interest some pretty obvious and

834
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,039
interesting problems came out and that's

835
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,720
what we decided to share in this

836
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,279
document

837
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,279
and since the topic is about

838
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,399
programmable logical controller

839
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,960
programmable logic controllers so these

840
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,240
plcs are like uh rugged computers

841
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,559
they control and monitor devices and

842
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,360
also manipulate the output on the

843
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,080
factory floors or industry systems

844
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,840
they are pretty much the fundamental

845
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,159
building block block for automation

846
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,399
whether you want to perform sequence of

847
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,720
opera operations on a smart

848
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,200
manufacturing or control motion for a

849
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,760
specific robot or just collect

850
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,440
continuous monitoring data plc's are the

851
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,120
computers that are controlling the

852
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,679
devices

853
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,240
they come in different shapes and sizes

854
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,960
so

855
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,480
when you're talking about

856
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,639
automation and you want to add large

857
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,520
number of devices you end up

858
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,599
putting a lot of physical computers and

859
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,560
they since they have to be

860
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,599
uh environment they have to be rugged

861
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,000
environments sometimes they have to be

862
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,879
dust proof humidity and moisture proof

863
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,040
and temperature proof

864
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,000
you have to build some sturdy cages

865
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,280
around them

866
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,520
and what that ends up taking a lot of

867
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,280
your factory floor

868
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
so the problem we were trying to look at

869
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,918
is that how do you handle the scale of

870
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,639
these plc devices

871
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,879
the good thing is most of the devices

872
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,839
are these plc controllers are pretty

873
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,040
much uh they have the same

874
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
design like you have a control unit

875
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,239
which comprises of cpu and memory and

876
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,960
then there they connect to io modules

877
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,640
which then directly talk to field

878
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,440
devices on the factory floor

879
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,680
and in order to handle this problem of

880
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,839
scaling and automation

881
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,920
we thought about the virtualization

882
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,480
approach where you can scale out and

883
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
elastically change the

884
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,599
cpu and memory configuration because as

885
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,560
you

886
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,640
so what's related to automation is

887
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,800
number of process controls or the

888
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,720
sequence the

889
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
depth of the sequence that you want to

890
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,480
perform in terms of controlling a

891
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,880
particular process like you want to

892
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,359
control certain machinery in one cell

893
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,599
and then correlate it with sequence of

894
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,000
operations on a different site cell on

895
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,520
the factory floor

896
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,720
so these type of actions require a lot

897
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,320
more processing power and more memory

898
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,040
and virtualization of plc's is one way

899
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,760
to achieve it because then based on what

900
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,079
your process is either you can allocate

901
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,480
small amount of memory small processing

902
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
power or you could go

903
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,440
even beyond that

904
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,960
and

905
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,160
so what we do is we formally define

906
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,720
virtual plc which is

907
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,880
the hardware agnostic abstraction of

908
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,000
control unit and memory functions of plc

909
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,880
what it needs now is an interface to the

910
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,520
i o modules because you have

911
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,359
extracted out cu portion of the plc

912
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,760
and this is not really an unrealistic

913
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,200
concept any all the devices above plc

914
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,760
have already been virtualized we have

915
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,040
already seen use cases where hmi scada

916
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,160
mes these devices and equipment have

917
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,839
been virtualized they are running on

918
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,320
commodity networks and in fact

919
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,040
plc is the last component that hasn't

920
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,440
been fully virtualized yet

921
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,599
and once we have done that it is

922
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,200
actually a

923
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,240
major step towards integration of id and

924
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,200
ot

925
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,560
because then you can take a plc device

926
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,520
as another function in the network and

927
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,000
co relate with id operations or

928
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,880
application level functions and put them

929
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,400
together on the id network

930
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,599
there are other benefits of plc some of

931
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,760
them are pretty straightforward in terms

932
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,480
of what virtualization brings for us in

933
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,119
terms of scaling out and elastically

934
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,079
adding or allocating resources for

935
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,119
that plc so if you have

936
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,680
a much bigger pipeline of the sequences

937
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,280
of operation

938
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,839
operators can allocate a lot more

939
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,400
processing power and memory to it

940
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,560
and one of the

941
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,640
many times we are

942
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,520
operators are using different plc's to

943
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,320
control lower level plc's

944
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,560
so now with this approach

945
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,480
uh we can uh

946
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,520
visualize uh an nfb platform or a

947
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,920
service function chain kind of thing

948
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,720
where you can correlate all these plc's

949
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,599
together and if they rely if they reside

950
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,040
on the same

951
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,160
platform um you have a very compact data

952
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
movement you're just moving your data

953
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,040
from

954
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,280
one function to the other on the same

955
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,640
platform so that kind of simplifies how

956
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,760
operations are working on a factory flow

957
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,839
it also gives a tighter and integration

958
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,920
with applications so you can also place

959
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,160
high-level applications business logic

960
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,760
sitting next to it

961
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,200
and

962
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,359
edge compute becomes a lot more

963
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,240
realistic and it's a very interesting

964
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,119
that

965
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,079
once we have moved all the plcs not all

966
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,839
or whatever some

967
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,800
few plc's into the edge compute network

968
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,400
support we can look at edge data centers

969
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,760
as a multi-tenant solution where

970
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,359
a

971
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,839
operator on a factory floor they do not

972
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,560
need to invest that much on the memory

973
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,640
and compute infrastructure

974
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,040
and they can lease the resources from a

975
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,760
third-party vendor or if you want to

976
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,320
interconnect multiple sites together

977
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,720
that edge compute network can integrate

978
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,359
applications from different sites

979
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,400
and

980
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,200
we also have constraints for

981
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,520
low latency applications and that's

982
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,400
where

983
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,400
i uh ietf technologies like that net or

984
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,800
other high precision control algorithms

985
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,160
can be used uh the benefit will be that

986
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,960
most of the sensitive silicon part of

987
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,640
plc which is your control cpu or the ram

988
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,520
part

989
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,839
you have moved them out of a hostile

990
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,640
environment which is uh so you're right

991
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,040
the amount of the volume of rugged gear

992
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,960
from the factory floor has

993
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,480
reduced a lot

994
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,359
and

995
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,760
how we realize digital twins that also

996
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,960
becomes much simpler because uh

997
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,160
now your plc is a software form and

998
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,839
integrating into some kind of a

999
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,078
simulation model becomes much easier

1000
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,200
and so how do we realize these virtual

1001
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,760
plc's uh there are uh

1002
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,839
three different approaches the first one

1003
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,480
is just extract the hardware

1004
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,359
so you will have a program or the plc

1005
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,920
logic that you can run on commodity

1006
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,720
hardware or any hardware so that just

1007
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,240
you c c u and i o part are integrated

1008
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,480
in that case your interface with rest of

1009
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,200
the applications on top of plc has not

1010
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,800
changed at all

1011
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,520
so this is a good abstraction but we

1012
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,680
don't get anything out of it

1013
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,079
and the second option could be within a

1014
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,560
zone like on a factory floor

1015
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,000
we have actually separated out cu and io

1016
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,880
parts

1017
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,079
in that case it becomes a problem of

1018
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,720
how do we provide a common interface

1019
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,240
from the cu portion to the i o modules

1020
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,319
on the factory network

1021
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,920
and uh the

1022
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,400
highest highest degree of disaggregated

1023
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,160
case will be when we are actually

1024
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,400
crossing the zone boundaries where

1025
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,960
applications and virtual plc's are

1026
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,760
residing together and we need to support

1027
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,119
a common interface over a van or a large

1028
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,960
scale network and you're crossing the

1029
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,680
factory's own boundaries

1030
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,680
and the third part would be the third

1031
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,760
case will be the ideal approach that we

1032
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,240
want to achieve but uh

1033
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,560
for that to happen we will have to

1034
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,280
pretty much break the hierarchical model

1035
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,599
the purdue model here since we are

1036
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,720
moving the devices from l1 and l2 level

1037
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,800
all the way up into the enterprise

1038
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,000
applications so that uh

1039
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,359
that imbalances the security paradigm of

1040
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,800
purdue model

1041
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,200
and we need to find a way to

1042
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,240
so basically when we go from uh physical

1043
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,560
plcs to virtual plc is pretty much we

1044
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,119
are looking for a disaggregated model

1045
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,200
and that is something we need to

1046
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,520
look into in order to support virtual

1047
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,200
plcs

1048
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,240
so based on this input we came up with

1049
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,680
the some

1050
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,319
problems of realizing for realizing

1051
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,079
virtual plc's

1052
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,040
and first one will be related to now

1053
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,400
your uh

1054
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,800
control unit and io modules are

1055
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,400
separated so what will be the

1056
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,119
how these plc's will speak speak to io

1057
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,960
modules since they're in the software

1058
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,640
format now

1059
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,680
any plc can control the i o modules or

1060
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
the devices underneath

1061
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,040
how do we provide authentication and

1062
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,040
association mechanisms to these devices

1063
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,200
and then there is also

1064
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,480
uh

1065
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,560
a problem how do we determine if a

1066
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,119
virtual plc was talking from somewhere

1067
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,720
outside your factory zone network or it

1068
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,079
was in the edge cloud in that case your

1069
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,640
security policies have to be

1070
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,880
programmed accordingly

1071
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,240
then there are corresponding

1072
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,640
expectations from the network

1073
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,599
so if you see when we move virtual plc's

1074
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,079
away from the factory floor then there

1075
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,280
is nothing but just the network between

1076
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,520
plc and the fact

1077
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,000
and the floor devices so most of the

1078
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,720
intelligence comes into the network how

1079
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,640
the network is interfacing with those

1080
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,280
devices and the intelligence about the

1081
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,000
compute and memory how the data is

1082
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,079
stored has moved out of the factory

1083
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,280
floor

1084
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,560
and

1085
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,280
this means that we have an opportunity

1086
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,640
to define

1087
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,680
a more meaningful policies that are that

1088
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,400
does not require deep packet infection

1089
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,880
but we can come up with a new model in

1090
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,480
which we look at

1091
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,119
actually what is my end device and i how

1092
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,119
i want to connect with it and what kind

1093
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,200
of processes are allowed to perform on

1094
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,160
it

1095
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,240
and then there is a limitation of our

1096
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,560
hierarchical structure we need to

1097
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,240
transition from hierarchical to

1098
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,760
disaggregation

1099
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,599
how do we go about it

1100
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,400
and then there is this underlying

1101
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,520
thing that

1102
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,599
devices still speak different kind of

1103
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,319
protocols and how will we support those

1104
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,680
protocols like profibus modbus the

1105
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,720
interface to io modules does not change

1106
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,599
and

1107
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,839
how our common network interface will

1108
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,880
support these protocols

1109
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,200
so based on that we can look at some

1110
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,480
requirements such as

1111
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
what are the addresses for these virtual

1112
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,880
plc's depending upon how they reside in

1113
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,160
the network

1114
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,000
and how what is the scope of

1115
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,240
authentication how do you authenticate

1116
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,960
these virtual plc's because we still

1117
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,680
want to preserve the safety and security

1118
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,319
of how operations are performed

1119
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,119
and

1120
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,520
we need we also need to define some key

1121
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,680
performance indicators in terms of

1122
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,720
how we describe the latency resiliency

1123
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,160
of the system if i'm if my plc is in the

1124
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,079
edge or cloud

1125
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,480
how do i make sure that any process

1126
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,760
request that i sent from there was

1127
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,560
accepted and was properly processed by

1128
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,880
the i o devices so we can leverage some

1129
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,760
of the

1130
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,960
existing technologies that net dsn and

1131
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,200
come up with more resilient solutions on

1132
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,800
top of them

1133
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,440
then there are obviously

1134
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,640
corresponding network environments and

1135
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,480
this is where i think it

1136
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,440
leads back to our uh

1137
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,760
framework draft that now we have an

1138
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,720
opportunity to build a converged network

1139
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,839
because we have already taken care of

1140
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,480
most of the intelligent

1141
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,960
components out of the network and our

1142
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,079
interface can now be really unified

1143
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,880
because id and ot devices are pretty

1144
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,640
much sitting together

1145
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,000
and the interface how cu 2 io module

1146
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,200
will happen

1147
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,119
is something that

1148
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,040
will be one of the problems we need to

1149
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,359
solve

1150
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,880
so that's pretty much it before going

1151
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,680
deeper into it i just wanted to share

1152
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,200
that

1153
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,880
how these virtual plc realization work

1154
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,920
will be

1155
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,040
considered within iot ops or how do we

1156
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,960
proceed further further with these

1157
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,160
things the things i'm trying to answer

1158
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,240
at least raise questions from problem

1159
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,720
statement are like how do we

1160
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,280
disaggregate different security zones

1161
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,119
how do we come up with a formal method

1162
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,599
of connecting to edge compute networks

1163
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,480
how do we define our virtual plc's

1164
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,880
and hopefully if that

1165
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,079
work is

1166
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,560
consumed then we translate into the

1167
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,640
framework which is based on

1168
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,480
unified fabric

1169
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,160
and

1170
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,880
share it with external stos that are

1171
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,280
really working on industrial networks

1172
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,280
and tell them hey this is the

1173
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,760
informational or best practices work

1174
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,160
that is coming from idf we have some

1175
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,720
protocols and technologies that could

1176
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,760
help you

1177
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,000
deploy your systems and or how you use

1178
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,440
idf to solve these problems

1179
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,839
yeah so that's pretty much it

1180
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,880
thank you any questions

1181
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,839
so this is hank another chair so this is

1182
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,640
hank another chair

1183
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,359
and could you mute yourself and put your

1184
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,000
mute just to speak

1185
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,720
i can do it

1186
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,319
that would be nice um so thank you and

1187
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,800
and um so yeah this is um

1188
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,559
after hearing the problem statement the

1189
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,480
requirement this is a lot of things that

1190
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,960
on a lot of different layers so when i

1191
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,880
look at this problem from my personal

1192
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,760
point of problem awareness

1193
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,319
already the different field buses like

1194
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,640
like you said modbus and profibus and

1195
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,839
then we have the scada the s5 the s7

1196
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:14,640
um

1197
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,720
already getting that aligned

1198
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,200
and then a little bit homogenized that's

1199
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,280
that's its own problem right

1200
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,960
so so yeah that's that's somewhat

1201
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,960
involved in all what you do but that's

1202
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,960
its own problem space and then you have

1203
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,520
the virtualization of the glue

1204
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,400
which is now the virtual plc

1205
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,160
that would handle that and itf

1206
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,480
technology can help you do that but i

1207
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,119
think passing on the messages in a way

1208
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,680
that is not utterly confusing or from

1209
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,040
the 80s

1210
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,960
so i think one of the things

1211
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,040
that would really help this domain

1212
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,800
because you're dealing with legacy that

1213
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,359
will not go away but in the future you

1214
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,559
want to have a better way to uh

1215
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,520
set things to do do recipes to do the

1216
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,359
planning whatever the scada can do it's

1217
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,680
busy setting and getting things and i

1218
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,559
think the itf has uh very good building

1219
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,400
blocks for that and and there are even

1220
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,520
even experimental ones like uh new ones

1221
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,319
like the uh semantic data format right

1222
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,160
where the safe description of them of

1223
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,680
these plcs will be kicking in so i think

1224
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,480
um

1225
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,839
this is a

1226
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,319
multi-problem thing now

1227
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,520
and the virtualization of plcs i think

1228
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,000
is a very high level goal

1229
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,440
and maybe

1230
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,400
it's in it's it's it's uh very

1231
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,280
useful to the purpose to to segment

1232
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,440
like for example the messaging problem

1233
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,839
out like like i have all these

1234
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,440
proprietary messages but there are

1235
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,359
actually not so many they're just

1236
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,400
proprietary

1237
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,960
sorry they're just old not necessarily

1238
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,760
proprietary and and now we can re re

1239
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,599
transform them i don't know an objection

1240
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,640
or c or something and then go from there

1241
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,000
expose them via virtualized thing that

1242
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,440
is now very manageable because it

1243
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,960
doesn't have to take into account all

1244
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,480
the different things you already know

1245
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,720
how to transform them so just from my

1246
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,640
point of view and i know we don't have a

1247
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,880
lot of time left so but that would be

1248
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,839
my comment with the uh no hats on

1249
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,480
okay yeah i can take that feedback and

1250
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,680
try to narrow down it even further and

1251
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,079
which actually will mean that not do

1252
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,119
anything with this draft and

1253
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,280
go back to the initial problem that we

1254
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,160
have discussed couple of ideas ago where

1255
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,280
we were talking about uh

1256
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,319
unifying different messages

1257
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,880
i should really

1258
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,640
we should really close

1259
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,800
the giveaway

1260
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,720
over here

1261
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,439
if we really want to

1262
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,359
medical i'm sorry just for me but one

1263
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,200
question i have

1264
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,839
is um as far as i thought about this

1265
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,240
stuff again and again it always comes

1266
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,160
down to the problem that we have

1267
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,240
real-time systems very often and we need

1268
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,480
to have these

1269
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,880
yeah real-time network communication

1270
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,280
which is going through active layer 3

1271
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,680
devices at the end which usually works

1272
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,200
not so well so that's why the

1273
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,880
deterministic network stuff is there so

1274
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,280
my question is how far along is the

1275
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,559
deterministic networking

1276
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,520
yeah technology already is that is that

1277
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,640
feasible right now

1278
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,960
so as far as i know

1279
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,800
echo

1280
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,480
is

1281
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,480
pretty much feasible i think they have

1282
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,359
some protocols that are already

1283
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:24,720
being developed

1284
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,760
and that's one of the ideas that how do

1285
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,559
we come up with an architecture that

1286
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,440
integrates that net more easily

1287
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,520
and that's where the idea of unified

1288
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,119
fabric came in

1289
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,800
so they have already developed some

1290
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,359
technologies uh they are actually using

1291
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,000
tsn i guess right now they are building

1292
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,559
solutions on top of tsn

1293
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:47,760
and

1294
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,280
i need to plug in with them to see

1295
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,680
how feasible it is for them but i think

1296
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,280
it should be possible to connect from

1297
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,520
edge compute to uh

1298
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,280
at least some

1299
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,000
factory site using that net technologies

1300
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,680
thank you

1301
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,640
okay

1302
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,839
thank you

1303
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,078
okay

1304
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,880
um hi this is hannes uh

1305
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,880
i think it would be good to drag along

1306
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,720
some people who work in this space and

1307
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,440
are manufacturers like siemens um

1308
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,839
and from our interactions i know that

1309
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,760
they are not using off-the-shelf

1310
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,960
hardware

1311
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,119
because you pretty much

1312
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,559
because of the previously mentioned

1313
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,280
freedom requirements you cannot

1314
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,119
we at arm we have our own class of

1315
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,200
processors specifically for that purpose

1316
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,760
it's called the r-class processor

1317
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,040
which uses virtualization um

1318
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,759
but only because of memory isolation

1319
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,920
sort of software isolation

1320
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,359
which includes memory resolution um

1321
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:52,640
to

1322
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,520
because you can't use um virtual memory

1323
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,599
because that uh introduces a lot of

1324
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,440
unpredictability in the in the whole

1325
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,200
scheduling and then a whole sort of

1326
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,000
response time so it's an extremely

1327
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,319
it's an extremely complex space and if

1328
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,559
you see what vendors do

1329
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,240
they basically rewrite the whole

1330
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,680
software stock from

1331
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,319
from bottom to top um because current

1332
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,880
software like in like off-the-shelf

1333
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,800
software that we are typically using in

1334
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,480
other areas

1335
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,520
is

1336
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,400
not

1337
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,839
bound to to um the real-time behavior

1338
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,440
that you would need in those systems so

1339
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,920
it's it's very demanding so drag some of

1340
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,520
those guys along it would be interesting

1341
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,800
to hear what they

1342
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,440
what they have to say

1343
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,000
so here so that's an interesting point

1344
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,400
and do understand it is uh somewhat

1345
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,440
difficult and i'm not promoting that we

1346
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,000
should use off-the-shelf hardware even

1347
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,640
if uh even with vendor-specific

1348
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,040
platforms you could have benefits from

1349
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,200
virtualizing plcs

1350
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,599
and uh as i said that how you put

1351
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,440
different plcs together on the same

1352
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,520
platform you can get better integration

1353
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,920
between applications and software

1354
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,640
but yeah it is a paradigm shift i do

1355
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,640
agree

1356
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,680
all right thank you kieran can you stop

1357
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,240
sharing i think

1358
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,440
welcome to the box

1359
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,680
thank you

1360
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,200
once upon a star if you stay in the box

1361
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,960
but this box is actually smaller now

1362
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,118
don't worry about 200 cameras are fine

1363
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,839
what

1364
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,280
sorry there will be a slightly slow

1365
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,160
delay because the data tracker did not

1366
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,000
recognize or upload apparently

1367
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,839
i could do the jeopardy music but i'm

1368
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,160
not doing that

1369
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,480
now

1370
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,119
no no

1371
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,880
i guess it's my punishment for sending

1372
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,880
the slides to me yeah

1373
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,520
it makes sense to send them

1374
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,759
in time

1375
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,040
i think i can literally ban you but

1376
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,760
you're taking the notes so

1377
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,079
one free

1378
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,040
almost

1379
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,079
close enough

1380
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,280
we're going with that right um

1381
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,400
so

1382
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,440
good morning

1383
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,079
um i'm pete from eth zurich

1384
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,359
new here

1385
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,839
and today i will be presenting a paper

1386
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,480
that we originally presented at gritties

1387
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,559
in lausanne last year but i think it

1388
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,200
could also be um useful feedback here or

1389
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,400
useful input here so this is work that

1390
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,520
some colleagues at eth um did together

1391
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,599
with franco monte from msf partner their

1392
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,079
company they do consulting for

1393
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,079
critical infrastructure security so they

1394
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,119
do power plants and those kind of things

1395
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,079
so the presentation um has two parts

1396
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,559
roughly first it's a discussion of how

1397
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,240
industrial networks are structured today

1398
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,680
and then challenges that we're seeing in

1399
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,960
these networks

1400
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,280
and then the second part is a maybe

1401
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,040
somewhat futuristic

1402
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,200
proposal of how we could restructure

1403
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,880
these networks

1404
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,559
in a more modern way

1405
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,520
so slide please

1406
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,599
right

1407
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,440
so um when we look at industrial

1408
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,319
networks today what we almost always see

1409
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,680
is that there's this very strong

1410
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,839
hierarchy and this hierarchy has two

1411
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,240
reasons firstly and the network is

1412
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,960
hierarchical because the control systems

1413
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,599
that the network is controlling or that

1414
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:24,799
the network is connecting to is

1415
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,880
hierarchical and these control systems

1416
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,640
are typically located together with the

1417
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,760
processes that are being controlled

1418
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,920
so hence the network kind of naturally

1419
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,640
inherits this hierarchical structure

1420
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,720
and then second there's this general

1421
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,480
notion that having this hierarchy in

1422
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,400
your network is good for security

1423
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,160
because typically there will be security

1424
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,000
enforcement points between every level

1425
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,599
of the hierarchy so the lower you go

1426
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,280
down the hierarchy the higher your

1427
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,280
security level gets and at the bottom

1428
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,119
that's where the most

1429
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,880
security critical devices would be

1430
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,319
placed

1431
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,720
slides

1432
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,760
now

1433
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,079
we're seeing that

1434
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,680
this traditional way of organizing the

1435
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,760
network is more and more being

1436
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,400
challenged um in the last couple of

1437
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,760
years

1438
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,760
so first one of these challenges is that

1439
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,480
we're seeing changes to the network

1440
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,680
for example in the data center sdn has

1441
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,200
pretty much or is pretty much taking

1442
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,839
over these days and with the ipot

1443
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,680
convergence that means that it's also

1444
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,000
only a matter of time before we also

1445
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,839
start to see these things coming to the

1446
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,359
factory floor

1447
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,880
at the same time

1448
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,680
the i3 is working on tsn which will

1449
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,079
probably make ethernet a

1450
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,400
more or less universal replacement for

1451
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,359
um

1452
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,480
all of today's wired field buses so over

1453
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,160
time we will likely also see all of

1454
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,760
these field buses being replaced by

1455
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,280
ethernet

1456
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,799
and these things they really from a

1457
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,520
technological standpoint they

1458
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,359
bring the top and the bottom of this

1459
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,119
traditional hierarchy closer together

1460
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,640
which means that

1461
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,799
almost by definition it becomes harder

1462
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,720
to keep them separated

1463
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,400
on the other hand all of these new

1464
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,400
technologies are

1465
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,799
typically centrally managed which means

1466
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,400
that

1467
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,359
the relevance of

1468
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,359
distributed security enforcement and the

1469
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,680
effectiveness of such methods are is

1470
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,119
being reduced

1471
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,599
slightly

1472
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,559
then we're also seeing

1473
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,400
changes to the automation infrastructure

1474
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,400
itself so

1475
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,760
we've seen already a couple of times

1476
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,559
that as the requirements

1477
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,079
that are placed on technology kind of

1478
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,640
start superseding the capabilities we're

1479
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,960
moving to um

1480
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,359
to more general purpose components

1481
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:40,839
again in the data center we've had

1482
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:42,960
virtualization um

1483
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,319
in the

1484
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:46,400
industrial world we're seeing ipot

1485
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,000
convergence right now

1486
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,839
and as kevin was discussing we're also

1487
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:51,839
seeing these virtual or virtualized

1488
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,680
automation functions like soft plc

1489
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,880
subscribers soft hmi

1490
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,640
and these things

1491
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,240
or what's interesting about these is

1492
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,319
that this virtualization breaks the

1493
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,559
assumption that your controllers need to

1494
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,160
be placed close to the processes they

1495
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,160
control so they could be placed in the

1496
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,000
edge or in the clouds and this means

1497
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,680
that you need a network architecture

1498
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,599
that

1499
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,520
allows you to decouple the logical and

1500
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,680
physical location of your assets

1501
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,000
right

1502
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,240
then we're also seeing changes to

1503
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,240
information flows where it used to be

1504
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,200
that

1505
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,559
um

1506
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,480
that flows would really always only

1507
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,319
cross one layer of this hierarchy at a

1508
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,440
time

1509
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,040
now there are more and more flows that

1510
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,599
cause many or even all of the layers for

1511
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:36,799
example if you have a device that's

1512
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,880
sitting in the field that's uploading

1513
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,839
data

1514
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,119
to a

1515
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,640
to a cloud service or something like

1516
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,640
predictive maintenance and now you need

1517
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,319
to punch holes all the way down your

1518
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,400
hierarchy and this not only leads to

1519
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,079
high management overheads but it's also

1520
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,240
bad for security

1521
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,520
then we're also seeing changes to the

1522
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,280
threat models um

1523
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,039
where with the original network design

1524
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:58,319
the assumption was that the attacker

1525
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,760
would come from the top and would have

1526
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,760
to work its way down

1527
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,240
with more complex devices in the network

1528
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,000
that need updates or more mobile devices

1529
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,039
with more

1530
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,119
devices that can be

1531
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,599
remotely managed or

1532
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,520
increased wireless technologies it's

1533
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,440
becoming more and more likely that the

1534
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,359
attacker can actually

1535
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:20,960
appear somewhere in the middle or even

1536
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,240
at the bottom of the network instead of

1537
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,440
at the top and this undermines this

1538
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,480
assumption of incremental security

1539
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,079
and then we're seeing changes to

1540
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,520
operational models

1541
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,520
where now more and more plants are

1542
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,200
sometimes don't even have anyone in them

1543
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,200
and they're completely managed remotely

1544
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,720
so all this control traffic needs to

1545
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,960
travel over the inter domain

1546
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,520
slides

1547
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,680
so

1548
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,200
with

1549
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,880
all of these changes and challenges in

1550
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,359
mind what we try to do is

1551
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,880
come up with a clean slate and think

1552
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,640
like in the ideal world from a

1553
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,480
management perspective

1554
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,720
how would we want a network architecture

1555
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,640
to look to support this

1556
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,760
and what we've come up with is tableau

1557
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,119
and here on the slide you see the

1558
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,559
network that i had a couple of slides

1559
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:08,319
earlier redrawn in the tableau

1560
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:09,839
architecture

1561
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,280
so one of the first things that we do

1562
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,440
this did is we separated end host and

1563
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,599
transit functionality of the network

1564
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,200
and then give every

1565
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,119
end host zone a so-called transition

1566
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,960
point that connects it to the transit

1567
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,200
network

1568
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,960
this effectively flattens the network

1569
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,720
hierarchy and provides this big central

1570
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,119
transit network in the middle

1571
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,799
um that in principle has full

1572
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,559
connectivity between all of the network

1573
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,359
zones but then there's a central um

1574
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,760
controller that puts limitations on

1575
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,000
which transitions or

1576
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
between which zones and in which

1577
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,200
patterns traffic can flow

1578
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,720
and because this transit network is

1579
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,640
relatively open all the traffic between

1580
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,400
the transition points is

1581
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,200
tunneled so encrypted and authenticated

1582
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,200
slides

1583
01:03:58,319 --> 01:03:59,920
what's interesting about an architecture

1584
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,680
like this is that it gives you really a

1585
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,200
lot of flexibility in how you want to

1586
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,799
structure your network

1587
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,720
um for example you can do things like

1588
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,880
hybrid plant cloud networks where let's

1589
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,480
say you have a physical network that has

1590
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,440
a number of zones um but for each of

1591
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,920
these zones you also use some sort of of

1592
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,599
cloud service for example to support the

1593
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,359
devices that are in that zone

1594
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:20,880
you can replicate

1595
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,720
um

1596
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,160
certain zones or all of the zones that

1597
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,839
you have in your physical plant into the

1598
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:26,960
clouds

1599
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,359
and then by configuring this policy you

1600
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:30,880
can place zones that are physically

1601
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,799
distant adjacently close

1602
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,359
or logically close

1603
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:36,799
but you can also put zones that are

1604
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,079
physically close logically distant

1605
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,920
slide

1606
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,359
it also

1607
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:44,880
helps with things like multi-homing

1608
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,880
because you only need to take care of

1609
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,520
the connectivity between your transition

1610
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,440
points and then the logical connectivity

1611
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,440
of whatever is in your zone follows

1612
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,920
slides

1613
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:01,039
and you can do things like partial

1614
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,520
deployments in two ways

1615
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,480
either

1616
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,680
you can

1617
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,720
just

1618
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,640
convert one part of your network to a

1619
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,319
tableau architecture while keeping a

1620
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,200
hierarchical architecture otherwise

1621
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,680
and this within that part that is

1622
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,240
tableau oriented keeps all of your or of

1623
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,079
the nice tableau properties

1624
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,640
um or you can if you have a network that

1625
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,680
follows

1626
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,319
a tableau structure you can also overlay

1627
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:29,599
more traditional hierarchy hierarchical

1628
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,000
zone transition policy so logically it

1629
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,920
still looks like a traditional network

1630
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,039
and then you have more time to

1631
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,839
transition your policies over time

1632
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:40,240
flight

1633
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,520
can you

1634
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,960
no problem

1635
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,079
um

1636
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,079
as a

1637
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,240
technical facilitator for this we use

1638
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,480
mondrian which is work from colleagues

1639
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,599
of mine

1640
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,839
which creates

1641
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,520
these notions of transition points in

1642
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,119
the zone controller in the enterprise

1643
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:00,000
setting

1644
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,760
and binds these transition points

1645
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,160
together across the enter domain into an

1646
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,559
into the main transition zone

1647
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,880
that then allows traffic to flow

1648
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,520
unrestricted

1649
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,440
the mycolic showed that you can actually

1650
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,319
do this

1651
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,440
more efficient than i would have

1652
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,280
expected and they show that they can do

1653
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,760
this with less than five microseconds of

1654
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,520
delay per

1655
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,440
transit point that is encountered by a

1656
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,760
packet

1657
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,960
slide

1658
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,880
if you want to read more about mondrian

1659
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,839
there's a paper i will not go into more

1660
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:32,799
details

1661
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,319
today but instead i would like to say

1662
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:38,480
something about defense in-depth slides

1663
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,480
because

1664
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,720
what's often argued is in these in this

1665
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,319
hierarchically structured networks is

1666
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,160
that this hierarchy is necessary for

1667
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,599
defense in depth and to have a strong

1668
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,160
defense of your network

1669
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,280
um

1670
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,440
and specifically and the fact that you

1671
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,880
have these layered firewalls and that

1672
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,480
you have a lot of heterogeneity and what

1673
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,079
kind of devices

1674
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,720
are used in the network is argue or is

1675
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,359
is used as an argument um for security

1676
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,119
and and it said that that facilitates

1677
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,200
defense in that

1678
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,640
um

1679
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,680
our

1680
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,839
point or our take on this is that

1681
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,480
actually this is not as black and white

1682
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,079
and doing these things or having layered

1683
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,680
firewalls and having heterogeneity does

1684
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,440
not automatically lead to defense in

1685
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,359
depth because that really needs you

1686
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,920
or requires you to have this um

1687
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,680
security oriented mindset throughout

1688
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,200
your organization and that is something

1689
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,720
that you can do with and without this

1690
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,640
traditional structure

1691
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,680
and

1692
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,680
there's also past work that shows that

1693
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,000
having these really complex policies or

1694
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,839
complex networks with heart administer

1695
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,520
policies can actually harm security in

1696
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,280
some ways

1697
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,680
and additionally as i discussed in the

1698
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,280
beginning the threat models are actually

1699
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,200
changing which means that

1700
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,440
um because this hierarchical

1701
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,960
network model

1702
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,119
the security assumptions of it

1703
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,160
rely or assume make some assumptions

1704
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,079
about the underlying network if the

1705
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,640
underlying network is changing and if

1706
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,240
those models are changing then also your

1707
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,920
security models or your security

1708
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,880
properties will stop the holds

1709
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,079
in tableau we try to replace this

1710
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,240
by having policy simplification and

1711
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,359
allowing

1712
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:14,960
giving you better control over your

1713
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,479
policies

1714
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,640
with more fine-grained zoning and also

1715
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,399
facilitating automated network

1716
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,799
verification by having only one place

1717
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,198
where your policy is specified

1718
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:28,158
then slide

1719
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:31,520
we do however so we've been thinking

1720
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,520
about how could we still introduce

1721
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,960
heterogeneity into the network though

1722
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,319
because it definitely

1723
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,279
it does

1724
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,719
provide a benefit and in some um

1725
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:42,640
in some situations for example in power

1726
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,600
plants

1727
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,920
um or in hydro dams or things like this

1728
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,359
you might still require this head

1729
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,960
virginity

1730
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,399
and we looked at how can you introduce

1731
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,960
heterogeneity without compromising the

1732
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,719
core features that something like

1733
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,560
tableau would provide so flexible

1734
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,479
network routing and simplified policy

1735
01:08:58,479 --> 01:08:59,679
management

1736
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,679
and our take on this is that

1737
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:02,640
you

1738
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,319
standardize the interface between the

1739
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,640
various tableau components and then you

1740
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,080
can have a heterogeneous set of

1741
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,520
transition points that is deployed to

1742
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,719
your network

1743
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,238
that listens to

1744
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:13,759
multiple heterogeneous controller

1745
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,759
implementations and for example there's

1746
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,600
some majority voting

1747
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,560
that all operate on the same policy file

1748
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,479
but then this policy file can be

1749
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:24,479
verified in multiple independent ways

1750
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:25,839
for example

1751
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:27,520
through manual verification or through

1752
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,439
different types of automated or formal

1753
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,080
verification

1754
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:34,560
slides

1755
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,238
so just to recap that

1756
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,479
um so you've seen that

1757
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:39,759
um

1758
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,000
specifically or that that changes to the

1759
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,439
industrial network and specifically

1760
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,679
these changes come from the iot that's

1761
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,759
coming up and from ite convergence are

1762
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:49,759
challenging the traditional ways that we

1763
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,920
defend its networks

1764
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,000
um we see that some of the assumptions

1765
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,840
that really come from these that are

1766
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,239
that this uh that this purgiou based

1767
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,560
network is based on no longer holds so

1768
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,120
we have eroding security properties

1769
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,040
and then we have a proposal that

1770
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,560
flattens these this network hierarchy

1771
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,719
enabling more flexible inter-domain

1772
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,239
traffic management

1773
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,080
and that has centralized policy

1774
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,199
management

1775
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,520
and then we've shown how or we've talked

1776
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,600
about how modern security practices with

1777
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,199
structured head virginity can actually

1778
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:24,640
replace this layered approach

1779
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,520
um

1780
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,640
and with that

1781
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,159
i'm open to

1782
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:30,800
discussion or questions or comments

1783
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,360
outrage

1784
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,920
so there are three people the line that

1785
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,880
is virtual and not virtual wonderful so

1786
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,440
elliott is first please edit go ahead

1787
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,960
good morning

1788
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,120
and good afternoon and a very early

1789
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,120
morning to some

1790
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,520
colleagues and friends

1791
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,440
yeah thanks very much for for your

1792
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,440
presentation um

1793
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,199
as a side comment i'm based in the

1794
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,880
zurich area i would love to get together

1795
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,440
with you and talk about this at eth or

1796
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,159
or at cisco where i work

1797
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:11,920
or virtually whatever people feel

1798
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,080
comfortable with um two comments

1799
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,040
first

1800
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,440
um

1801
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,199
the

1802
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:24,080
uh there there's a there's i think a

1803
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,080
little bit hidden in your presentation

1804
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,080
which is i think natural

1805
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,640
when you're trying to give a summary

1806
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,080
um

1807
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,199
the term heterogeneous heterogeneity has

1808
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,280
to be very carefully understood in this

1809
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,600
context

1810
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,280
you know there's all sorts of

1811
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,880
heterogeneity

1812
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,719
and um

1813
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,679
i don't think you quite defined it and

1814
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,120
it is sort of key to your presentation

1815
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,800
so uh

1816
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,679
maybe

1817
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,600
you can take a few minutes after i

1818
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,120
finish the second comment just to say

1819
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,440
what you mean by heterogeneity

1820
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,120
boy i can't even speak today i had a

1821
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,560
head cold earlier now it was tripping

1822
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,760
over my tongue

1823
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,960
the

1824
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,840
second point i was going to

1825
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,239
make is that

1826
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,400
my experience

1827
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,040
when it comes to these models

1828
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,719
and if you look at the way that esa 99

1829
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,440
came together it really sort of fit

1830
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,480
itself around what the manufacturers

1831
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,920
were doing

1832
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,960
and now

1833
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,719
what you're saying is well manufacturers

1834
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:29,679
are going to be doing something

1835
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,120
different

1836
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,960
taking advantage advantage of the

1837
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,280
various virtualization capabilities the

1838
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,360
merging i think your problem statement

1839
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,960
is spot on

1840
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,920
okay

1841
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:40,880
the

1842
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,080
but the but the magic here is in the

1843
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,360
policy not in the deployment

1844
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,440
of not in the enforcement but in the

1845
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,800
policy

1846
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,920
we have

1847
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,520
gazillions

1848
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,000
of means to flatten networks in terms of

1849
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,880
access control for instance it it they

1850
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,960
exist throughout you know since since

1851
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,679
day one practically so

1852
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,840
maybe you could talk just a little bit

1853
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,719
more about this this policy aspect in

1854
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,880
terms of you know voting and and

1855
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,040
different controllers and how you do

1856
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,640
policy merge

1857
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,400
and i realize that's a very lengthy

1858
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,320
subject but maybe a minute or two on

1859
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,759
each of these would be great thank you

1860
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,719
right um so the first comment the

1861
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,360
question was what is heterogeneity so

1862
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,400
here

1863
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,719
um i'm trying to capture that is the

1864
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,640
idea that if you have a network

1865
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,320
where you have different security

1866
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,920
enforcement techniques or even different

1867
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,360
just firewalls

1868
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,480
that are designed by different vendors

1869
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,520
that are completely independent products

1870
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,280
there's this notion in this in this

1871
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,760
industry that if you um

1872
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,080
by having that an attacker would need to

1873
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,159
so let's say that that from the top

1874
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:53,760
layer to the bottom layer you have

1875
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,000
firewalls from five different vendors in

1876
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,679
there there's this notion that okay

1877
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:59,840
that's good because um the adversary

1878
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,840
would have to find holes in five

1879
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,360
different firewalls or five different

1880
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,600
firewall implementations and before he

1881
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,880
can actually

1882
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,600
break the network sufficiently to really

1883
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,199
hit your lower

1884
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,640
field layer there and to really be able

1885
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,600
to affect the physical process

1886
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,040
um

1887
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,080
then

1888
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,239
for the second comment i'm not 100 sure

1889
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,480
that that i fully understood what you're

1890
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,640
trying to say there

1891
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,080
um

1892
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,280
if if i may um what i'm saying is that

1893
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,080
how is it that you program

1894
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,760
are you are you are you how do you

1895
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,840
program access

1896
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,719
and how do you decide what needs access

1897
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,880
to what or what's an access violation

1898
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,719
when when you're not enforcing but

1899
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,159
merely observing thank you

1900
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:47,520
right um

1901
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,719
so

1902
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,040
in in this setting we would be

1903
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,440
enforcing right because you're so you're

1904
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,560
only this solution which again is from

1905
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,920
our perspective this is not a final

1906
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,280
solution this is kind of a first

1907
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,960
conversation starter

1908
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,239
um

1909
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:03,440
is

1910
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,719
um

1911
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,560
the access management is done on the

1912
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,000
level of the zones right so which

1913
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,400
transition to which zone is allowed and

1914
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,080
which one is not

1915
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,280
um and this at the moment um

1916
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,520
in the in the monorail implementation

1917
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,480
that we have is very

1918
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,040
enterprise oriented so it's based on ip

1919
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,440
ranges we actually

1920
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,280
i find is a very interesting thing and

1921
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,280
we would like to to look more into how

1922
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,400
can we

1923
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,480
change that to be more practical for the

1924
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,360
industrial setting um and we also but we

1925
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,400
actually also find this quite

1926
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,880
challenging because it's very hard to

1927
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,960
get corporations or get access to real

1928
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,560
world data from from these kind of

1929
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,760
plants

1930
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,120
um

1931
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,600
so embarrassed

1932
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,760
so yeah

1933
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,600
it's actually one of the one of the big

1934
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,880
problems that we have in the space and

1935
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,199
finding the best way to really tackle or

1936
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,920
to to be able to tackle these problems

1937
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,199
so again turles is next but um michael

1938
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,679
you have 30 seconds

1939
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:04,880
yeah

1940
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,760
make it fast well thanks a lot but

1941
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,679
please take it positively right i mean

1942
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,080
it was great marketing but i didn't see

1943
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,760
a single second that was explaining to

1944
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,080
me what tableau was doing so i'm really

1945
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,159
just guessing like it could be a set of

1946
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,920
coordinated working distributed

1947
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,920
firewalls you're throwing in that are

1948
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,080
somehow magically creating the zones so

1949
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,239
i would have really loved to spend

1950
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,080
one minute out of the 15 minutes we've

1951
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,159
been doing all of this on some technical

1952
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:33,120
explanation what it really does

1953
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,000
yeah i i think that's a fair point um

1954
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,080
and we have the list so you can you can

1955
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,320
add some explanations to this that's

1956
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,360
visible to everybody here and uh as even

1957
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,120
uh michael might have more comments

1958
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,960
please put them if they're

1959
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,280
addressable also to this thank you

1960
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,000
so next up is um i think called heinz

1961
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,840
i'm from the top of my head i hope i'm

1962
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,520
not doing this wrong

1963
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,840
no i'm doing this wrong yeah

1964
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,800
all markers sorry both of you yeah that

1965
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,120
was like a little bit confused to me hi

1966
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,400
so

1967
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,280
flaws yours um presentation should be on

1968
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,440
the way

1969
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,159
uh yeah that's one

1970
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,400
three two one

1971
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,839
would you like to control them

1972
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,199
who can control the slides can i come

1973
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,840
control it we just say next slide we

1974
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,440
will do this okay okay okay thank you

1975
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,000
um yeah hi i'm marcus and in this talk

1976
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,719
we would like to present our um

1977
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:48,560
envisioned communication architecture

1978
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,280
for future energy grid operation systems

1979
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,080
which has to be low latency reliable

1980
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,800
and secure which is part of our research

1981
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,400
project venus we are currently working

1982
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,360
on

1983
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,679
and the scope of this talk will be next

1984
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,159
slide please

1985
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,239
the scope of this talk will be as i said

1986
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:07,600
the

1987
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,679
introduction into our research project

1988
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:13,040
venus as a whole and then

1989
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,960
we will get give

1990
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,320
technical details about the

1991
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,159
communication architecture we are

1992
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,159
envisioning here and the goal with this

1993
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,719
talk is to find out which itf solutions

1994
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,040
might be might be considerable

1995
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,640
for contribution

1996
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,159
by the project

1997
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:30,719
and also which iotf working groups might

1998
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,360
be interesting for the technologies

1999
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,760
we are facing here in venus and

2000
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,840
yeah as hank already said we i'm uh we

2001
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,080
are we are two here um i'm here with uh

2002
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,320
collins gender from aperios uh who has

2003
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,040
mainly driven this talk here at itf

2004
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,040
and i'm marcus from the chair of

2005
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,199
communication and distributed systems

2006
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,760
at rwthr

2007
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,000
next slide please um so this is our

2008
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,320
agenda but i would suggest to get right

2009
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,679
into it so next slide please

2010
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:04,000
so the energy distribution grid is

2011
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,760
changing which is mainly driven by

2012
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,000
measures to meet climate codes so we are

2013
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,159
basically moving away from fossil energy

2014
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:13,760
sources um going to to um yeah

2015
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,560
generating energy from renewables and

2016
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,640
this also means that um the

2017
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,880
production of energy um moves from um

2018
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,800
yeah conventional centralized power

2019
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,040
plants to

2020
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,520
distributed power generation um for

2021
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,560
example um by solar cells um yeah

2022
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,800
basically placed all over the country

2023
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,760
and this also introduces changes to the

2024
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,239
as i said distribution grid but um more

2025
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,640
specifically to the power flows as now

2026
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,880
not only centralized a few centralized

2027
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,080
power plants are generating the energy

2028
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,480
and um the distribution grid has to

2029
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,120
distribute it um to our consumers

2030
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,080
but all of the yeah the the power can be

2031
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,560
fed into the or need to be fed into the

2032
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,800
distribution grid all over the place

2033
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,719
and yeah this basically leads to

2034
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,880
multi-directional power flows

2035
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,880
the problem or one problem the

2036
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,880
distribution grid providers are facing

2037
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,280
here is that their traditional static

2038
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,679
distribution grid protection systems

2039
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:17,440
cannot cope with that

2040
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,000
so they are basically parameterized

2041
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,280
once or

2042
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,480
two times a year um manually at every

2043
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,880
station out in the field

2044
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,280
um but for such multi-directional and

2045
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,600
highly volatile power flows

2046
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,880
um it needs to be more um

2047
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,800
yeah they cannot cope with these

2048
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,760
these volatile power flows

2049
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,760
and um

2050
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,520
yeah this basically means that they for

2051
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,000
example can change it can detect changes

2052
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,239
in your power flows and misidentify them

2053
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,560
as a short circuit which then basically

2054
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,880
can result in false containment

2055
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,719
or partial shutdown which of course is

2056
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,960
not great um for the consumers but

2057
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,800
elsewhere is not great for the con for

2058
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,679
the um for the efficiency of the of the

2059
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:03,280
power grid and power

2060
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,960
generation as a whole

2061
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,800
next slide please

2062
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,800
um and this is where

2063
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,360
venus comes into play and we knows we

2064
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,639
want

2065
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:13,600
to

2066
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,120
basically prepare the protection

2067
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,120
technology to cope with these new

2068
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,440
challenges with these highly volatile

2069
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,840
multi-directional power flows

2070
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,400
and the idea here is to introduce an

2071
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,320
adaptive and interconnected grid

2072
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,880
protection system and we can see here on

2073
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,480
the right

2074
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,080
um the

2075
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,440
um yeah a scheme which basically yeah

2076
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,960
depicts

2077
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,520
um the envisioned architecture we can

2078
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,840
see here the grid control center on the

2079
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,440
top which basically has information

2080
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,560
about all flows going on in the power

2081
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,679
grid

2082
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,080
and then is able to calculate specific

2083
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,159
protection parameters

2084
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,320
for the current scenario the power grid

2085
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,400
is in and then these protection

2086
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,400
parameters need to be transmitted to

2087
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,239
these protection

2088
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,000
stations or protection hardware in the

2089
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,320
field

2090
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,520
but this of this has to be done

2091
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,280
over a low latency communication

2092
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,520
infrastructure as these control messages

2093
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,920
need to arrive at each of these stations

2094
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,320
at the same time because we do not want

2095
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,600
to have any inconsistent um

2096
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,960
states in our

2097
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,560
protection

2098
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,080
system so each um each of these devices

2099
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,239
need to be configured at the same time

2100
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,159
and this is also the the reason why this

2101
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,600
communication infrastructure has to be

2102
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,719
reliable

2103
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:34,560
because we do not want

2104
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,400
to lose any control messages

2105
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,120
and furthermore this system also needs

2106
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,320
to be secure

2107
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,880
as we do not want attackers to be able

2108
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,840
to intercept any ongoing communication

2109
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,960
um

2110
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,520
for example to yeah to attack the the

2111
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,840
power grid and um for example shut it

2112
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,120
down

2113
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,880
but also the systems um in the field

2114
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,920
need to be secured hardware-wise um to

2115
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,960
um yeah ensure that attackers

2116
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,400
our attacks are

2117
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,719
uh are detected here and uh how we would

2118
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,639
like to face that in venus is what khan

2119
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,040
hands will elaborate now

2120
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,320
next slide please

2121
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,719
um just a second so i see uh tallis has

2122
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:20,600
raised his hand

2123
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,960
yeah no i but i think maybe uh questions

2124
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,880
are in order right now or do you want to

2125
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,719
just disrupt your presentation flow

2126
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,199
we can we can we can take the question

2127
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:32,400
now

2128
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,639
just protection can happen at so many

2129
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,080
different levels right so i was just

2130
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,000
wondering if you're talking about packet

2131
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,840
level or something higher level as well

2132
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,400
as is the first point

2133
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,960
uh so the protection is at the energy

2134
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,840
energy level so it's basically

2135
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,920
completely um yeah that this is what the

2136
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,520
what the um

2137
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,600
what the electrical engineering guys are

2138
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,760
doing in our project so we are not not

2139
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,080
alone here so this is completely in the

2140
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,000
um yeah in the power level

2141
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,600
the protection

2142
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,040
all right thanks

2143
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,280
okay

2144
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,600
so when we talk about protection is

2145
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,360
about it's about safety it's not about

2146
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,199
i.t security at that point

2147
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:14,800
uh it's about how uh at the energy

2148
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,199
the energy grid is shut off in cases

2149
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,199
where it's needed before

2150
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,639
stuff breaks

2151
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,920
um yeah um so then then about the actual

2152
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,520
communication the rt part of this

2153
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,880
because the force thought were more

2154
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,840
small about energy um that's the stuff i

2155
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,600
wanted to talk about now

2156
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,880
just to make it more obvious um

2157
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,560
for a protection system

2158
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,480
right now if you configure it you

2159
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,199
configure it once you put it into a into

2160
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:43,280
into the grid somewhere and it will stay

2161
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,880
there and will work there until it's

2162
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,679
decommissioned so it will not have an

2163
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:50,719
actual connection to to some kind of

2164
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,600
control system which actually changes

2165
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,600
parameters um

2166
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,719
so it is

2167
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,639
the only thing it does it does some

2168
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:00,800
reporting to the grid control center and

2169
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,760
that's why we have this um

2170
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,760
new communication flow where a

2171
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,480
protection system is now not anymore

2172
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,800
just a reporting system which is

2173
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,280
steadily configured once

2174
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,840
but now it's a system which is

2175
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,600
configured

2176
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,760
all the time and has different profiles

2177
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,600
and will react on different states of

2178
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,120
the energy grid so it needs to

2179
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,719
communicate

2180
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,159
also from the

2181
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:28,320
configuration point um as well and not

2182
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,480
just from the reporting point of view

2183
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,080
and for this um we have some um yeah

2184
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,880
some kind of uh parallels to the plc uh

2185
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,480
talk we had before we need to have a

2186
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,800
communication which works

2187
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,880
also sometimes in real time and that's

2188
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,280
why we have these three um

2189
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,120
requirements low latency reliability and

2190
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,920
security and in the latency part we

2191
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,800
start to tackle these requirements we

2192
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,639
looked into itf standards and other

2193
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:58,960
stuff and we said okay for low latency

2194
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,880
we might be able to use sdn to actually

2195
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,480
reserve

2196
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,840
paths to

2197
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,440
systems and to react on failures and do

2198
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,120
some failure

2199
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,080
for

2200
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,560
also we can try to use uh for

2201
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,159
reliability and deliberate for low

2202
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,560
latency multi-pass technologies like

2203
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,760
multi-pass dsp or multi-purpose quick or

2204
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,800
to be able to transfer more data on

2205
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,840
different paths to the system and be

2206
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,000
faster be quicker at the end be more

2207
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,239
reliable so that if someone one pass

2208
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,199
fails

2209
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:35,360
and at the end the last part we thought

2210
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,719
about was

2211
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,639
how can we do how can we make these

2212
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:40,560
systems which didn't need to be secure

2213
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,000
at this start

2214
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,480
now need to be secure uh since they are

2215
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,760
actually communicating through the

2216
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,960
internet and are reachable through the

2217
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,600
internet and then we looked into trust

2218
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,239
execution environments to actually

2219
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,639
protect some of the code we which are in

2220
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,159
this these systems

2221
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:59,280
and which is like the code that

2222
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,440
is very mandatory to

2223
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,960
ensure safety

2224
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,239
um or their safety functions and also

2225
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,400
look into how we could

2226
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,520
actually use the te and

2227
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,760
had the teeth to have and then found

2228
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,360
teep and suit

2229
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,320
um

2230
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,360
on on the on the itf agenda so to speak

2231
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,000
and also for security found rats and

2232
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,400
that's the stuff we wanted to to apply

2233
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,239
for security

2234
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:29,040
but and that's the next slide

2235
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,800
um please

2236
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
but we are still at the beginning right

2237
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,360
now we already we also discussed if we

2238
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,280
want really want to present this today

2239
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,280
but we thought after talking also to the

2240
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,199
chairs it would be good to to actually

2241
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:45,360
start begin um also start with our itf

2242
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,360
uh contribution from the beginning of

2243
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:51,120
the project so ask you guys and um on

2244
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,280
your opinion on your experience and all

2245
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,800
the workshops you know

2246
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,280
what what could be considered uh or

2247
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,440
should be so considered from from our

2248
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,840
side where should we also look at uh

2249
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,840
maybe besides the technology already

2250
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,840
said maybe one of these technologies may

2251
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,920
also be not the right fit

2252
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,239
and that's why we started here with the

2253
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,960
aim to contribute to the itf and also

2254
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,639
ask you all

2255
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,800
which work groups would be

2256
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,120
interested in results or would have

2257
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,360
questions we should actually tackle in

2258
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,000
our project

2259
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,679
so charles is the next of the mic

2260
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,920
yeah i'm 12 secret again so i'm still

2261
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,320
kind of so you know please reach out to

2262
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,480
me we can we can certainly chat uh

2263
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,239
offline for example and gather also

2264
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:39,520
after the meeting

2265
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,320
um i'm still quite unsure about the

2266
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,600
exact scope of the project because i

2267
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,600
would assume that a lot of the things

2268
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,760
you are looking for as far as network

2269
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,239
reliability and signaling and everything

2270
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,800
is concerned should be solved by

2271
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,320
you know the latest generation of the

2272
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,000
work going on and the synchrophaser

2273
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,880
grids

2274
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,440
of of the different continents but maybe

2275
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,120
you're looking into a more edge use

2276
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,880
cases where you're not really having to

2277
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,159
deal with the

2278
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,760
you know the synchronization of the

2279
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,000
phase of of of the power generation

2280
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,080
which puts very hard time and

2281
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,239
reliability um requirements on the

2282
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:16,560
network so and you're looking for more

2283
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,199
lightweight different scoped solution

2284
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:20,080
for

2285
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,760
probably soft switch over right with

2286
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,280
interruption in the middle or so so

2287
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,600
that's why the the better understand the

2288
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,280
use case i think the more easy it would

2289
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,199
be to to give more recommendations what

2290
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:30,239
you had

2291
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:33,199
seemed to be uh top down um so i think

2292
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,040
you haven't arrived at the network level

2293
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,360
or we're having things like that net and

2294
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,199
then appropriate routing technologies

2295
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:42,560
for that obviously ieee tsn is there as

2296
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,800
well so yeah there are multiple levels

2297
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,840
where you can look at things

2298
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,839
thank you

2299
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,600
uh michael richardson at the mic um

2300
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,520
thank you for coming to us with this

2301
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,600
this is really actually quite exciting

2302
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,639
um

2303
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:06,480
uh the ietf is always um looking for

2304
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,400
operators to help and participate in

2305
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,159
you know figuring out where things go

2306
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:15,760
and in this sense you guys very much are

2307
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,840
operator or proxy for

2308
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,440
operators and you have lots of nice

2309
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,280
logos on the bottom which is something

2310
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,000
we don't always do but anyway um

2311
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,800
the the the the thing here is though

2312
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,560
that um

2313
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,480
uh all of those things that you said are

2314
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,560
really good but actually

2315
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,600
um

2316
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,400
what would be help us the most and

2317
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,920
probably help you

2318
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,920
is to contribute to those working groups

2319
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,679
the use cases that you need to fulfill

2320
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:46,719
so

2321
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:48,239
even though whatever the rat's

2322
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:50,560
architecture is for instance pretty much

2323
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,159
done um

2324
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,480
that's okay if you come along and say

2325
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,560
and this is our use case and it doesn't

2326
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,320
how does it fit into this and maybe it

2327
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,800
does and maybe it doesn't and it's okay

2328
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,040
that if we missed your your specific

2329
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,199
case it doesn't mean it's it's you know

2330
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,520
illegal or something um it simply means

2331
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,600
that no one contributed it yet so i

2332
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,440
think that would be really do good and i

2333
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,360
would be really excited to to have you

2334
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,880
in all of those you know different

2335
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,760
groups and yes as turtles says det net

2336
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,719
and other all sorts of stuff um and it

2337
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,800
sounds to me like you have a multitude

2338
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,159
of different things and there's a little

2339
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,000
bit of um

2340
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,199
what's the right word um

2341
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,360
uh well we can just build it with

2342
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,440
everything right kind of thing that that

2343
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,159
i i'm concerned but you know so you'll

2344
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:37,760
have to figure that out what is what is

2345
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,639
enough do you need quick and mptcp

2346
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:43,120
probably not

2347
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:46,800
maybe maybe sdns maybe sdn is actually a

2348
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,639
failure because you have a single point

2349
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,960
of failure and you really want to run

2350
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,199
ospf in the end actually and that's good

2351
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:55,440
enough i don't know um i have experience

2352
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,679
with voip networks where people try to

2353
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,120
do stp

2354
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,960
for voip failover and it doesn't work

2355
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,560
because it's multiple seconds you need

2356
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,360
to run ospf to get and have equal cost

2357
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,440
multipath for voip you can't do that way

2358
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,960
that's kind of things that you will hear

2359
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,480
and if you come to the ihf and talk

2360
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,000
about your requirements in the different

2361
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,639
areas there so i think you guys have a

2362
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,199
very uh a busy schedule ahead of you

2363
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,760
where you'll have to go to five or six

2364
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,639
different

2365
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:22,880
uh areas and three or four groups within

2366
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,480
that area so it should be very exciting

2367
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,600
for you

2368
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,080
may you live in interesting times yeah

2369
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,040
so we've like two minutes left for uh uh

2370
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,719
two minus the minutes left for two

2371
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:33,920
people

2372
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,880
so

2373
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,080
go ahead this is dave robin um i'm i'm

2374
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,400
curious to know i i agree with your work

2375
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,679
today i've done a lot of work with smart

2376
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,600
grid so i appreciate the real-time

2377
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,440
aspect of some of it the inter most

2378
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,120
thing interesting thing i wrote down

2379
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,040
from the presentation is this concept of

2380
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,440
simultaneous action

2381
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,239
and that is a problem that is maybe

2382
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:55,920
solved in a different way and i'm not

2383
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,280
sure whether you did

2384
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,360
net or other methods of reliable

2385
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,040
multi-path everything you can think of

2386
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,120
to get messages but at the moment that

2387
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,199
you require some action to take place in

2388
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:06,639
two places

2389
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:09,520
the network could drop and so so if that

2390
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,360
is really your problem

2391
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,280
then um you have to solve that in a

2392
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,960
different way we've done that with with

2393
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,280
uh pre-negotiated time synchronized

2394
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,280
actions in other words we can negotiate

2395
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,760
one second from now this will happen all

2396
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,320
sides acknowledge then at that moment it

2397
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,159
happens but the network could drop at

2398
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:27,600
the moment you're not actually basing

2399
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,159
the action on a message at that point so

2400
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:31,760
if that's your problem

2401
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,679
i'm not sure the itf can help you that's

2402
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:36,320
an application level design philosophy

2403
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,000
so the real question what i was coming

2404
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,040
up to is where is the ask of ietf here

2405
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,239
as

2406
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,080
we said we've got all these all these

2407
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,560
tools you can use

2408
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,719
and so use them

2409
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:49,679
i guess

2410
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:50,800
i guess what i'm saying is in this

2411
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,600
presentation i didn't see a hey ietf you

2412
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,560
don't have something to address this

2413
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,040
and the one thing i wrote down for this

2414
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,880
was the simultaneous action of multiple

2415
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,960
locations and i'm afraid that has to be

2416
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,719
solved in a different way

2417
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,719
than a protocol

2418
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:08,159
so

2419
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,080
thank you

2420
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,480
and then carson real quick

2421
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,000
yeah so um

2422
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,440
dave had the right question and i think

2423
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,320
i would really like to encourage you to

2424
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,600
actually

2425
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,360
look at your

2426
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:26,400
use case as michael said

2427
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:30,400
um try to identify the the sub problems

2428
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,400
there

2429
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,080
talk to us

2430
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,480
about applying

2431
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:39,120
the right technology for that

2432
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,239
and

2433
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:41,679
then

2434
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:43,360
your contribution really could be

2435
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,840
finding out whether the

2436
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,480
components that we have developed

2437
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,840
actually are solving your problem or not

2438
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,119
now that that is part feedback to a

2439
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:58,000
working group who has just been doing

2440
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,119
that work

2441
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:00,400
but it's also

2442
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,520
research

2443
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,760
and i would like to point out that there

2444
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,920
is actually a research group that's

2445
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,080
interesting research group that is

2446
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,480
very interested in research in in this

2447
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,520
space

2448
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,400
and

2449
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,560
as dave mentioned there are some

2450
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,920
application

2451
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,800
layer issues that that also are

2452
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,400
interesting and

2453
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,719
may have to figure in here

2454
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:25,360
uh so maybe we should look at this in

2455
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,679
the thinking research group in some

2456
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:28,480
future

2457
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,800
meetings

2458
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,639
thank you carson and in the interest of

2459
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:33,600
time

2460
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,080
harness

2461
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:38,880
um you were located 15 minutes can you

2462
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,119
do it in 10 you only have four slides

2463
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:43,839
now i can

2464
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:45,520
that was

2465
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,119
easy

2466
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:48,880
okay um

2467
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,040
so this is a little bit different to

2468
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,360
what uh you have seen just uh in the

2469
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,119
last few

2470
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:56,639
sort of minutes

2471
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,159
in the sense that i'm

2472
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,320
presenting to you of work that is done

2473
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:04,239
elsewhere in the u2a uh group on tls and

2474
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,360
dtls profiles next slide

2475
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,199
and i would like to create a little bit

2476
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:11,199
of awareness and hopefully some of you

2477
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:12,639
are actually

2478
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:13,679
um

2479
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:16,800
using or deploying iot devices and are

2480
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,600
securing those with uh dls and dtls and

2481
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,159
i would like to get your feedback

2482
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:24,560
as a reminder so there's a longer

2483
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,400
history to this

2484
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,600
namely

2485
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,920
we started off with the work in the utah

2486
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,119
group on

2487
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,199
rc

2488
01:36:32,199 --> 01:36:35,119
7925 which was about

2489
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,480
profiles

2490
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,600
of dls and dtls 1.2

2491
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,800
for uh for securing iot communication

2492
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,080
and um if you looked at that rfc it

2493
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,159
provides a lot of guidance on how to use

2494
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:50,400
algorithms and extensions

2495
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,600
um

2496
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,320
in the iud context because

2497
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,239
for dls there is obviously a lot of

2498
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:58,320
choice in terms of extensions not all of

2499
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,080
the extensions

2500
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,080
can be arbitrarily combined to make

2501
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,719
sense or even uh are then consequently

2502
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:06,880
secure and some of them obviously date

2503
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:07,840
back to

2504
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,400
earlier days so they are not um a good

2505
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,080
choice to begin with and that's what the

2506
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,920
document explains

2507
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,480
um we also made some um sort of

2508
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,400
profiling of dls in this in this

2509
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,199
document that's why iod profiles

2510
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,600
for example when it comes to the timeout

2511
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,159
values the dls specification provides

2512
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:28,639
some guidance for use in a generic

2513
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:30,000
internet on the web

2514
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,320
in particular and leaves it open to

2515
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,440
other

2516
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,000
application domains to

2517
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,800
um

2518
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,560
change those values and that's what that

2519
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,000
document did

2520
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,719
and and also as a sort of smaller thing

2521
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:44,719
it also describes on how to use ddls

2522
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,000
over sms

2523
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,040
um

2524
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,679
the on in the appendix okay so that was

2525
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:52,159
1.2 and it's finalized and um everything

2526
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,320
great and people are using it and

2527
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,639
um there are a number of implementations

2528
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:58,880
uh production quality implementations

2529
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,840
and the big

2530
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:05,280
iot cloud guys use that stuff next slide

2531
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:06,800
so fantastic

2532
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,159
um and then dls 1.3 came along

2533
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:11,679
and uh

2534
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:13,679
and the work on this on this

2535
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,280
profile started

2536
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:18,159
luckily of course uh there's all the

2537
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,800
algorithm recommendations for 1.3

2538
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,600
obviously current so there's this led to

2539
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,040
a much shorter document but there's

2540
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,880
still a few things that can be said

2541
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,560
about 1.3 specifically now as um

2542
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,400
sort of the embedded implementation i've

2543
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,280
also picked up 1.3 wolf ssl and empty ls

2544
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,679
have a 1.3 implementation so you

2545
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,840
um there are people who use

2546
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,119
1.3

2547
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:45,040
in their iot deployments um so

2548
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:48,000
so that's also a good development

2549
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,600
many of the recommendations can be

2550
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,679
carried over from the other rc that i

2551
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:53,520
just mentioned but of course there are

2552
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,520
some nuances

2553
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,520
and some differences with 1.3 compared

2554
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,840
to 1.2 of course

2555
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,920
for example um

2556
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,040
in

2557
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,480
the post handshake the resumption cases

2558
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,920
there's

2559
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,080
we added in the mean by the connection

2560
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:10,960
id

2561
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,880
there's the possibility to use the

2562
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,960
encrypted client hello if someone cares

2563
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,440
a lot about uh the privacy protection

2564
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,520
and the like um

2565
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,960
there is also

2566
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,840
an application profile for use of

2567
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:27,280
the co-op protocol with the zero rdd

2568
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,960
exchange because that doesn't provide

2569
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,280
replay protection in the

2570
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:34,320
in the dls handshake uh so you have to

2571
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,719
what the dls specifications calls out

2572
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:39,119
that you have to provide a story there

2573
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:41,679
there is a story in an uh in a separate

2574
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:43,920
document for http

2575
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,920
um and this is the the document that

2576
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,280
does the same

2577
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,800
for co-op

2578
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,119
and one thing that is still a sort of a

2579
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:54,239
controversial aspect is the choice of or

2580
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:55,920
the recommendations for algorithms

2581
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,800
specifically related to the use of aes

2582
01:39:58,800 --> 01:39:59,920
with

2583
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,679
the mode of operation

2584
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:04,400
um and ccm8

2585
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,960
which has a shorter authentication tag

2586
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,040
where this document

2587
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,280
currently recommends to

2588
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,400
um use gcm and ccm

2589
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,520
with the long authentication tag instead

2590
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,199
of the of the shorter ones so that's a

2591
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:20,480
little bit controversial because that

2592
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,400
was the preferred

2593
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,679
algorithm in in sort of the iod circles

2594
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:27,520
in the idf previously

2595
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,440
so we are gradually moving away from

2596
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,679
that um but uh

2597
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:32,880
this is not

2598
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,159
cast in stone yet so obviously if you

2599
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:38,480
work in that space and and deploy that

2600
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,239
algorithm we would obviously like to

2601
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:41,679
hear from you

2602
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:42,719
um

2603
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:44,639
the ddls

2604
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,480
the upcoming or

2605
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,320
dtlsrc

2606
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:52,719
um also discourages ccm8 um yeah for

2607
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:56,080
security so okay next slide

2608
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,920
so there's a lot of stuff in there

2609
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:01,760
and so the big ask um to you is

2610
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,119
like are you

2611
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:06,080
are you using uh tls 1.3 already in your

2612
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,000
deployments in your iot deployments and

2613
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,040
if so

2614
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:09,840
um

2615
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,600
let us know whether you stumbled across

2616
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,199
a few things or whether

2617
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:15,520
you find some of the

2618
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,639
recommendations in there useful or

2619
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,480
also if you don't find them useful then

2620
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,320
obviously we want want to hear as well

2621
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,360
from you

2622
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,880
so this is more

2623
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,040
sort of geared towards the ones who are

2624
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:30,000
actually doing it rather than

2625
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,520
um sort of thinking about it

2626
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,600
right so please bring your comments to

2627
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,560
uta working group yes exactly

2628
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,080
um

2629
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,760
yeah the uca working group is the right

2630
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,119
place um

2631
01:41:43,119 --> 01:41:47,159
uh to discuss those

2632
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:50,320
and trellis yeah yeah um cause eckerd so

2633
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,520
um i haven't read that so um that that

2634
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,679
looks quite interesting in the anima

2635
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,600
working group when we were trying to you

2636
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,760
know go through security review

2637
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,920
i was fighting long and hard not to have

2638
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,400
tls 1.3 which was fresh out of the door

2639
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,719
by the time we did the rfc being

2640
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:10,800
mandated but just 1.2 just in fear of

2641
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,520
not knowing what speed of

2642
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,920
you know availability of tls 1.3 i would

2643
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,080
have in the arbitrary low-end equipment

2644
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,800
primarily iot so would really be good to

2645
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,600
hear

2646
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,760
you know some some some more insight

2647
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,600
from from you folks that understand that

2648
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,000
iot equipment right at which point in

2649
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,800
time you know for any type of solution

2650
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,960
environments like anima brewski

2651
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,880
bootstrap all these things we can

2652
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,400
actually start mandating tls 1.3 or

2653
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,960
even specific profiles of that where

2654
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,199
i'll have to wrap my head around the

2655
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:45,040
reasons for the specific profiles first

2656
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,119
but yeah so because

2657
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,360
firmware upgrades and these type of

2658
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,760
equipment have traditionally been worse

2659
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:54,400
than continental shift or so so that

2660
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,000
that's very interesting work to learn

2661
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,679
more about this

2662
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:58,880
yeah um

2663
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,600
yeah as i mentioned like obviously the

2664
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,040
1.

2665
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:03,920
two

2666
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,000
sort of stacks are

2667
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,840
very common um

2668
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,840
but if you switch over to 1.3 on the

2669
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,440
server side and on the web it's

2670
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,159
obviously widely deployed there are lots

2671
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:16,239
of stacks available so you are you're

2672
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:17,440
really good there

2673
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,199
but when it in the embedded space

2674
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,840
everything takes a little bit longer um

2675
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,360
development wise

2676
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:27,280
and but luckily you can get um

2677
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,400
commercial stacks in in the meanwhile

2678
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,000
um

2679
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:32,960
and

2680
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,280
yeah so so they are like

2681
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,040
high quality implementations very

2682
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:39,199
performant integrated with hardware and

2683
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:40,480
so on so

2684
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,560
it's it's uh

2685
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,320
it's a it's good it's a good landscape

2686
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,280
today

2687
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:45,650
um

2688
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:48,400
[Music]

2689
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,679
yeah

2690
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:52,080
i think maybe i can have a final comment

2691
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,719
so if the duplicate the application of

2692
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:57,360
ccm8 is a topic to you that has been

2693
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,760
raised by thomas uh recently just on the

2694
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,080
core working group list again so if you

2695
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,719
have an opinion about that uh now's the

2696
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:07,719
time

2697
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:29,440
okay so um

2698
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,520
we use up a little bit more time than we

2699
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,920
expected but i think that's okay we had

2700
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,400
a bit of spare um

2701
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:40,159
chairs are starting to think about

2702
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:42,719
after a year of running iut orbs of

2703
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:45,199
documents to adopt

2704
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:48,480
obviously we'll uh

2705
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,000
will have a discussion in the working

2706
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,239
group

2707
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:54,800
we just had some preliminary discussions

2708
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,639
about possible documents like

2709
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:59,920
architecture so we asked brendan to do a

2710
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,040
little presentation to talk about one

2711
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:06,080
potential document

2712
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,960
so um i originally presented this uh

2713
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,600
document i guess two ietfs ago and um

2714
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,520
and then i let it expire uh next slide

2715
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,840
please

2716
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:25,760
uh and the reason for this is is kind of

2717
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,679
rolled up into uh what security

2718
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:31,600
documents actually are so i i

2719
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:32,880
have come to the conclusion that

2720
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,280
security documents always trend towards

2721
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:37,280
one of three things they either become

2722
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,840
an architecture a threat model or a

2723
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,600
document that details requirements or

2724
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,199
mitigations

2725
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:45,839
next slide please

2726
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:50,960
so when i wrote this it was definitely

2727
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,679
not an architecture it was not a threat

2728
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:55,920
model though there was a threat model

2729
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,080
that i had in mind mostly what it came

2730
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,800
down to was requirements and mitigations

2731
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,639
but it didn't have an architecture or a

2732
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:04,320
threat model so it was really hard to

2733
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,639
justify each of those mitigations

2734
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:09,440
next slide please

2735
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:15,520
um so i i had to to ask the question

2736
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,880
sort of you know where does this

2737
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,880
document go next and this is why i let

2738
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,679
it expire um it it really needs an

2739
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:24,320
architecture or a threat model

2740
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,320
um but it didn't make sense to just

2741
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:29,600
constrain that to only the problems that

2742
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,320
were addressed in the uh

2743
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:36,080
in the iot nets draft it it was really

2744
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,080
that would have left it very limited and

2745
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,159
i didn't see why we should leave it

2746
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:41,040
there

2747
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,199
it it actually strikes me that we should

2748
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:45,040
start considering what an iot

2749
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,280
architecture and an iot threat model

2750
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,400
would be

2751
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,480
um something uh

2752
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,320
a much higher level

2753
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,000
um

2754
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,520
but the question is where would these

2755
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,360
end because those could be massive

2756
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,480
documents

2757
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,280
next slide please

2758
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:04,719
so uh enisa did produce this iot best

2759
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:07,679
practices document and that covers a lot

2760
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:10,080
of this uh this space

2761
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,800
and arms psa documents cover a lot of

2762
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,560
the device side architecture for doing

2763
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,400
this kind of security

2764
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:19,119
uh michael

2765
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,840
surprise mike come on i didn't want to

2766
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,320
interrupt you here um i i wanted to

2767
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,280
speak at the end of your slide sorry

2768
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,840
okay cool i'll keep going then next

2769
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,400
slide please

2770
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:37,840
um what i've realized though is that we

2771
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,480
can't do a top-down structure uh and

2772
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:43,920
i don't think it makes sense to define

2773
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,840
an architecture and then define a threat

2774
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,600
model and then define mitigations

2775
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:50,159
because each architectural element adds

2776
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,080
new threats and each threat adds new

2777
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,400
mitigations and each mitigation adds new

2778
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,080
elements in the architecture so we're

2779
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,920
going to end up with through you know if

2780
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,360
we go through this it will end up with

2781
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,440
three tightly coupled documents

2782
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,119
and they'll all have it'll be a cluster

2783
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:05,119
that's all there is to it um i think

2784
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:07,440
they all have to be developed together

2785
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,239
next slide please

2786
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:13,440
um now that being said i think that this

2787
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,800
would end up being something very

2788
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,000
hierarchical so there are

2789
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,920
many security area working groups that

2790
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,560
are already working in parts of these

2791
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,800
problems there are some architectures

2792
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,400
and some threat models in many of the

2793
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:27,280
different

2794
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,360
iot working groups

2795
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,880
and i don't think we need to reproduce

2796
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,639
any of that work i think it just needs

2797
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:33,520
to be

2798
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,280
referenced so

2799
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:37,280
this would be an opportunity for us in

2800
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:40,000
iot ops to draw out cross-standard

2801
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,159
considerations and to draw out any

2802
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:44,719
useful combinations of standards and one

2803
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,960
of the the interesting examples of this

2804
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,440
would be when you combine co-rim suit

2805
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,920
and rats together all in one

2806
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:54,320
group that allows a

2807
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,280
um

2808
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,360
the the information the reference

2809
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,360
integrity manifest the co-rim to be

2810
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:02,320
delivered to a verifier signed by

2811
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,000
the firmware author

2812
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,239
so that

2813
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:10,000
when it gets an attestation report it no

2814
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,320
already has the verification information

2815
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,719
to to verify it and that's a really

2816
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:16,639
interesting um

2817
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:18,320
a really interesting uh more than the

2818
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:22,800
sum of its parts kind of uh situation

2819
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:25,599
next slide please

2820
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,599
i think that we could uh have an

2821
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:29,520
opportunity here to describe

2822
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,119
relationships between entities from

2823
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:32,639
different standards

2824
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:34,719
um

2825
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:36,320
there's a lot of places where standards

2826
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,560
leave things open-ended they don't

2827
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:40,719
describe relationships they leave things

2828
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:42,639
up to the implementer

2829
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:44,960
but there's this overarching

2830
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:48,480
uh view that many of us have about where

2831
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:50,400
these these relationships should be

2832
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,480
described and which

2833
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:55,199
what kind of implementations should be

2834
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,360
used by an implementer but this isn't

2835
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,760
really documented a lot of the time i

2836
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,760
think that we have an opportunity there

2837
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,560
to explain exactly how many of these

2838
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:07,840
standards should be used together

2839
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:08,880
and

2840
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:11,199
as i previously gave you the example for

2841
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:12,880
more details provided to attestation

2842
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,360
verifiers is a good example of this

2843
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:18,239
next slide please

2844
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:20,639
um now there's a couple of different iot

2845
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:22,159
architectures

2846
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:25,119
that we probably will have to describe

2847
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:26,639
uh

2848
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:28,159
so you have the centralized

2849
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:30,000
architectures where you have one

2850
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,840
authority or a group of authorities and

2851
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,480
communication passes via uh those

2852
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,400
authorities or their delegates

2853
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,320
um or alternatively you have

2854
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,760
peer-to-peer architectures that are

2855
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,080
decentralized and don't have authorities

2856
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,560
now that's a very uh

2857
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:48,480
wide separation next slide please

2858
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,360
so i don't think that most of them will

2859
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,639
end up being

2860
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:55,280
that extreme i think that we have will

2861
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:57,360
primarily have hybrid architectures so

2862
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,760
we have to describe essentially

2863
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:00,560
where

2864
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:04,080
the uh the benefits and drawbacks are

2865
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:07,040
in the architectures for these different

2866
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,679
modes of hybrid construction

2867
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:12,080
next slide please

2868
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,320
that's it okay i i did it fast so we'd

2869
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:17,199
have time for discussion

2870
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,320
which is great so uh michael your first

2871
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,119
line

2872
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:24,400
hi michael richardson so actually um so

2873
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:27,199
i had a thought sitting here that um

2874
01:51:27,199 --> 01:51:28,880
brendan with the same slides and the

2875
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,440
same words um had it been ted lemon or

2876
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:34,800
lorenzo speaking to us

2877
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,960
that we would understand everything very

2878
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,639
differently and he's a brendan has a

2879
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:40,639
very security and attestation point of

2880
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:43,119
view but if it's lorenzo speaking to us

2881
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:45,040
we would understand this was about ipv6

2882
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,639
connectivity and yet you could have used

2883
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:48,159
the same slides and the same words and

2884
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:49,599
all the stuff and the architectures and

2885
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:50,960
the mitigations and all this kind of

2886
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:51,840
stuff

2887
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,119
and that's kind of intro what i wanted

2888
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:55,920
to say back at the tableau uh thing was

2889
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,199
i you know

2890
01:51:57,199 --> 01:51:58,800
i quipped that all the examples were

2891
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,639
ipv4 and someone said well that's

2892
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:02,719
actually because operational plants

2893
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:04,000
really aren't

2894
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,880
lost in ipv4 but but a thing i wanted to

2895
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,639
say then and i think i want to say now

2896
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:09,520
again

2897
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:11,199
is that none of those layers of

2898
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:12,960
firewalling were ever designed as

2899
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:15,840
firewalls those were all designed as nat

2900
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,280
four fours because there was no

2901
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:19,440
architecture that allowed anybody to

2902
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,360
plug new pieces of network into the

2903
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,719
existing network and of course we

2904
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:25,440
designed it all into ibv6 ted's doing

2905
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,400
some lovely work with stub networking

2906
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,880
and the reason i mention this is that

2907
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,159
you can't really talk about

2908
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:34,480
decentralized communication until you

2909
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:36,560
have communication

2910
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,400
and you can't really add all those

2911
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,800
devices intelligently in routers and

2912
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,800
stuff until you have the security to

2913
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,119
back them and so we've actually got the

2914
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:46,880
same problem that your diagram of

2915
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:49,440
mitigations and architectures that's not

2916
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,760
just a security diagram

2917
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:54,400
it's actually an ietf wide diagram and

2918
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,040
the problems we have in iot is that

2919
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,880
we're basically you know got our fingers

2920
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,440
in 27 different uh camps at the same

2921
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,360
time trying to integrate it and the

2922
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,719
reason why

2923
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:06,480
tableau for instance

2924
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:07,440
is

2925
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,840
either very wishful or

2926
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,840
very enlightened

2927
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:15,679
is because effectively uh we need to as

2928
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:17,199
i think elliot said we need to actually

2929
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,520
be able to map all of those things

2930
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:20,800
together

2931
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:21,840
and so

2932
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,920
while i'm trying not to boil the ocean

2933
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:25,520
here i actually think there's some

2934
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,040
things that we can say

2935
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:30,320
involving security and networking and

2936
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:32,960
connectivity at the same time

2937
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,320
and things that we can say well you

2938
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,159
should do it this way

2939
01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:38,080
like that tableau backbone honestly

2940
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,000
should be ipv6 and all the pieces

2941
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,639
plugged into it should be nat 64

2942
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:44,960
okay because they are living in v4 space

2943
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,400
and that's actually an architecture that

2944
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,840
i would propose and it actually has

2945
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,679
really good security properties that

2946
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:52,480
that i think are relevant to things um

2947
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:54,159
and so i'm excited about this and i

2948
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:55,599
think that we want to go ahead with what

2949
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:57,280
you just said i'm very enthusiastic i

2950
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:58,400
don't i guess i don't have any questions

2951
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,960
for you i just wanted to to extend that

2952
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,880
view a little bit

2953
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,040
elliot's probably got to say that say

2954
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,599
figure out the part that i missed

2955
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:09,520
exactly but before i give elliott to

2956
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,280
mike so i want to highlight that the

2957
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,760
chat has a corresponding discussion

2958
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,080
that's not not directly always tied into

2959
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:18,080
what you just said but but maybe let's

2960
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,080
have a look at that and elliot now you

2961
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:23,840
are uh the mic is yours

2962
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:27,360
thank you oh hank

2963
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,679
um okay so brandon

2964
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:30,960
um

2965
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,119
no michael i'm not going to say

2966
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:35,599
uh i'm actually going to slightly

2967
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:37,040
disagree with

2968
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,639
both of you

2969
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:39,599
um

2970
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:40,639
in that

2971
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:42,400
quite honestly i liked what you did

2972
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,520
brandon

2973
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,080
um it basically showed how all the parts

2974
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,440
fit together

2975
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,599
in in your initial draft i thought that

2976
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:51,360
was a very good start and i think you're

2977
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:53,119
overthinking it

2978
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:56,480
i think actually just getting that far

2979
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:59,199
is is a win now if you want to

2980
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:01,040
restructure how you think about it i

2981
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:04,560
don't mind but just having sort of the

2982
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,239
a nice view

2983
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,960
that you presented two ietfs ago as i

2984
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,040
said to you i think on both then and on

2985
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:13,040
a call afterwards i think

2986
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:15,360
that's a substantial advance

2987
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,159
so

2988
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,119
i don't want to get mired in in

2989
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:21,760
overthinking the the way if you want to

2990
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:23,520
present this in a different way i'm all

2991
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,119
for it but you have a good starting

2992
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:27,119
point and we should go with that and if

2993
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,719
you want to restructure the starting

2994
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:31,760
point i'm okay with that but i'm not i

2995
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,400
i'll tell you what it would be a shame

2996
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,560
if if we lost that view that you

2997
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,719
presented

2998
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:43,239
okay that's all i wanted to say

2999
01:55:46,159 --> 01:55:49,679
so the uh other thing if

3000
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:52,880
i'm not mistaken brandon you wanted

3001
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,480
to see if there are some people who

3002
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,199
would like to help you out with this

3003
01:55:57,199 --> 01:55:59,520
well i mean if this is uh something that

3004
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,119
the uh

3005
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:02,639
that the working group is actually

3006
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:04,560
interested in then

3007
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,880
yeah absolutely it's it's a it's a big

3008
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:08,400
undertaking i don't think i can do this

3009
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,400
myself

3010
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:11,840
but uh

3011
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,520
that being said if this isn't something

3012
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,199
that the working group's interested in

3013
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:17,040
then um

3014
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:18,400
then that's fine

3015
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,800
and i guess to elliott's point uh

3016
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:24,480
i don't see a reason that we couldn't

3017
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,880
you know progress the work that i i had

3018
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:29,360
done um is just that when i tried to

3019
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,440
restructure it into you know to to

3020
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,440
explain why i was putting things

3021
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,760
together the why led to a threat model

3022
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,280
and the threat model pointed to a

3023
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,920
missing architecture and that sort of

3024
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,280
did mire me and he had essentially

3025
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:46,000
mentioned that

3026
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,400
what he'd like was essentially a table

3027
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:49,760
of the

3028
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:51,280
things that

3029
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,599
could go wrong and how these different

3030
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:56,159
combinations of technologies fixed them

3031
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:57,760
and that is a threat model right that's

3032
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:59,280
a threat model and an information model

3033
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,280
so i was attempting to put that all

3034
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:03,760
together um and that sort of pointed me

3035
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,639
to this bigger question

3036
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:09,119
so this is this is hanged before

3037
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:10,480
and so let's get on we have like three

3038
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:12,159
and a half minutes left and that's i

3039
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:15,119
think good enough um

3040
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:17,679
i i agree with elliot that the the first

3041
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:20,480
uh um draft of yours is like like the

3042
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,000
cornerstone

3043
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,520
and i have unfortunately to agree a a a

3044
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,119
frosting of a threat model and a

3045
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:29,119
requirement said about it

3046
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:32,080
is is is required for initial work but

3047
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,320
you don't have to again take all of it

3048
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,080
in because there was also mentioning

3049
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,159
like the plc has the same problem so

3050
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:40,480
maybe scope it to what you just had

3051
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:44,159
at a very specific type of uh threat

3052
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:46,239
model and requirements to that and i

3053
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:48,239
think that is already a big scope so

3054
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:50,239
maybe maybe do not exceed that and now

3055
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:54,239
i'm giving mike to carl hines

3056
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,159
just a comment from my part as far as i

3057
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:00,960
understood um everything right um i had

3058
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,119
the the yeah

3059
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:06,320
imposition so to speak to actually

3060
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,800
goes through different standards like

3061
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:11,040
uh iso 2701

3062
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:14,239
six iec six two four four three um bse

3063
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:17,280
gunshots and itc right catalog which is

3064
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:19,920
also relevant in german to put all the

3065
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,840
security measures together which are

3066
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:22,800
needed

3067
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:23,520
for

3068
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,000
foreign um industrial control system and

3069
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,040
it was the

3070
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,960
worst kind of work i ever ever have to

3071
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:32,159
do and it was quite annoying

3072
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:34,960
so everything which kind of aggregates

3073
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,040
stuff into something that can be

3074
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,080
evulated evaluated um

3075
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,679
and

3076
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:44,480
does relieve me from these kinds of work

3077
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:49,199
i think is a good step forward

3078
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:50,880
it sounds almost like you've done this

3079
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,040
before and you'd like to help

3080
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,520
i can at least i have a document that's

3081
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,119
published which actually

3082
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:59,040
does does the the

3083
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,360
comparison of these things so

3084
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,719
we can actually look into it and see if

3085
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:06,000
it's valuable in any case

3086
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,760
that sounds great yeah let's get

3087
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:10,480
together on the list or by directory but

3088
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,560
i'm going to give tallest the mic now

3089
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,360
yeah at all checkered again so um i hope

3090
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:19,599
i have some fun closing remarks um

3091
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:22,000
rent rand rand rant so i think we're

3092
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,320
playing here in the iitf for decades uh

3093
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,719
some harry potter game around voldemort

3094
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:28,400
don't name the name

3095
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:30,480
and it's the firewall right so i mean

3096
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,280
we've seen one presentation here today

3097
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:35,599
um about what i think ultimately will

3098
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:37,440
turn out to be some form of distributed

3099
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,199
firewall architecture

3100
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:42,560
this uh one i think has you know um

3101
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,560
security functions for filtering in the

3102
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,440
network firewall voldemort right written

3103
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:49,119
all over it as as part of the

3104
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:52,560
architecture um we have done uh great uh

3105
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,560
work on let's say the whole mud stuff

3106
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:57,119
right uh you know how do i know what a

3107
01:59:57,119 --> 02:00:00,480
oops firewall should do and

3108
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:02,320
i was asked to review performance

3109
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,960
measurements for oh security gateways

3110
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:07,199
right it's not called firewall so but i

3111
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:08,480
mean we're we're not having an

3112
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:10,639
architecture we're not you know openly

3113
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:12,480
admitting that there is voldemort oops

3114
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:15,040
firewall right so what what's what's the

3115
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:16,800
strategy of dealing with these things do

3116
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,560
we want to continue kind of just trying

3117
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:21,280
to scrap some bits and pieces uh

3118
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,760
on on every edge or you know in iot

3119
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:25,199
they're just

3120
02:00:25,199 --> 02:00:27,360
front and center center everywhere in

3121
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:30,000
these networks and uh a lot of it very

3122
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,560
useful a lot probably very painful

3123
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:36,000
um so i think it's you know uh

3124
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,840
in whatever shape or form we do it i

3125
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,000
think it's it's that that particular

3126
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,920
type of middle block function is is

3127
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,360
really front and center for something

3128
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,920
like iot ops i don't know exactly how to

3129
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:48,239
answer to it but doing it indirectly

3130
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:51,040
just as a side topic uh through

3131
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:53,599
an arbitrary set of of documents may not

3132
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:55,679
be sufficient enough right so

3133
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:58,159
you know firewalls in iot right so

3134
02:00:58,159 --> 02:01:00,239
what's what's kind of the io the the

3135
02:01:00,239 --> 02:01:03,280
ietf position on that maybe

3136
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,360
so okay i have an answer for that if we

3137
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:07,199
have time um

3138
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:09,280
my answer would be essentially that

3139
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:11,040
you're absolutely right we definitely

3140
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,599
need to focus on the firewall for a

3141
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:15,920
portion of the problem and that portion

3142
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:19,119
is probably exactly as uh it relates to

3143
02:01:19,119 --> 02:01:21,440
mud mud is absolutely dynamic firewall

3144
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:22,400
configuration

3145
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,639
probably also dynamic layer 3 switch

3146
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:27,119
configuration but that's

3147
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:30,080
maybe less relevant on wireless networks

3148
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:31,760
so so we can't make this a dialogue

3149
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:34,159
anymore because we are plus minute minus

3150
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:37,440
one minute but what i hear is a a quick

3151
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:40,639
draft that says why is this a firewall

3152
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:46,719
um might be useful to get yeah hahaha

3153
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:48,800
so sorry for breaking this up anything

3154
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,639
is a great discussion guys um there's

3155
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:54,239
this list uh iot ops at itf.org let's

3156
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:56,239
meet all there you might have an interim

3157
02:01:56,239 --> 02:01:58,560
we will uh plan that we will give a

3158
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,480
shout out and

3159
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,960
um yeah and i think uh

3160
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:04,639
it's probably safe to say that we'll

3161
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:08,000
spend a bit more time talking on

3162
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,320
specific deliverables next year yes no

3163
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,800
not only next time but we will uh mold a

3164
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:14,719
deliverable from this so if we heard

3165
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:17,280
names and we make that thing until the

3166
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,840
next meeting

3167
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:23,520
thank you all for coming

3168
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:26,520
jinx

3169
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:36,719
