at home at that desk at the front uh so

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,920
miteko using uh probably the lights

120
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,079
version of the meet echo tool

121
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,560
uh and you can join that uh there's a

122
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,720
special icon in the data tracker agenda

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,760
which allows you to join using that tool

124
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,480
um and we need to use uh meet echo to

125
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,399
join the microphone queue since we're

126
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,040
managing a uniform microphone queue for

127
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,200
both the local and the online

128
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,680
participants

129
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,120

version of muteco uh keep your audio and

131
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,760

for remote participants

133
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,079
please leave your audio and video off

134
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,279
unless you're

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,279
sharing or presenting or asking a

136
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,920
question during the session and again

137
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,240
there's a raise hand button you can use

138
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,079
to join the queue if you have questions

139
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,560
if you're having uh issues with the the

140
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,680
av equipment uh the the url on the slide

141
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
um allows you to report those

142
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,160
or mention miteko in in the chat

143
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,760
okay um so as i say this is the irtf

144
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,279
open meeting

145
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,040
and the the goals of the irtf are

146
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,600
focused on some of the longer term uh

147
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,360
research issues relating to the internet

148
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,839
and the irtf works in parallel to the

149
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,920
ietf uh which does the the more

150
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,600
short-term issues relating to

151
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,360
engineering and standards-making

152
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
um my my usual reminder that the iatif

153
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,079
is a research organization now it's not

154
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,519
a standards development organization um

155
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,240
in the irtf we're here to do research

156
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
and we're here to provide a venue where

157
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,880
the uh academic uh research community

158
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,120
the industry research community

159
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,760
uh can interact with the the engineers

160
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,279
and the standard setters uh in the ietf

161
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,360
uh but this is primarily a discussion

162
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,600
forum in it and it's a forum to make

163
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
connections

164
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,320
um and while the irtf um you know

165
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,160
because it's associated with the ietf

166
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,079
can publish informational or experiment

167
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,639
experimental documents as rfcs the

168
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,639
primary output of the research groups is

169
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,800
expected to be

170
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,760
understanding and research results

171
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,959
and academic papers primarily

172
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,638
rather than necessarily rfcs

173
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,320

the paper underlying this talk uh

351
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,480
several super storms planning for an

352
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
internet apocalypse was first presented

353
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,720
at the acm sitcom conference last year

354
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,000
uh singita over to you

355
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,159
i think you'll meet it still

356
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,000
yes

357
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,320
hi everyone uh i'm sandeeta i'm an

358
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,240
assistant professor at university of

359
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,159
california irvine and an affiliated

360
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,720
researcher at vmware research

361
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,039
today i'll be presenting my recent work

362
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,080
on

363
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,159
understanding the impact of a cosmic

364
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,400
phenomenon that is capable of taking

365
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
down the internet which is solar

366
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,200
superstorms

367
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,159
what are the impacts of losing internet

368
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,600
connectivity

369
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,840
we know that it can affect our

370
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,440
professional and social life

371
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,159
significantly especially now during the

372
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,679
pandemic

373
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,039
for large businesses the impact can be

374
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,480
devastating

375
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,280
the revenue loss per hour for some of

376
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,320
those companies are estimated to be tens

377
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,799
of millions of dollars

378
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,840
and at the scale of countries it can be

379
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,320
hundreds of millions per hour or in

380
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
billions per day

381
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and it's not just the economic impact

382
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,360
many of the other critical

383
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,919
infrastructure such as health care uh

384
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,919
depend on the that depend on the

385
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,520
internet and will be severely affected

386
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,320
now

387
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,360
what if we have an internet outage

388
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,080
lasting weeks or months and spanning

389
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
large areas across the globe

390
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,559
one might think that such a global

391
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,559
outage is never going to happen because

392
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,320
the internet is already in distributed

393
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,799
systems

394
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,480
but unfortunately

395
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,400
this is the worst case scenario that

396
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,919
could happen in our lifetime

397
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
the next once in a hundred year disaster

398
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,159
after this panoramic could be a solar

399
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,039
super storm that is capable of taking

400
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,279
down large parts of the internet

401
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,039
and today network researchers and

402
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,760
operators overlook this trip while

403
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
building our infrastructure

404
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
in this talk i'll present a deeper view

405
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,720
of this natural disaster and its impact

406
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,799
on various internet infrastructure

407
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,360
components

408
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,600
there are two types of solar events that

409
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,919
are popularly known as solar stones they

410
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,320
are solar flares and coronal mass

411
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,720
ejections

412
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,200
their impact on in global infrastructure

413
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
varies widely

414
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,039
solar stones

415
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,640
are

416
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,520
sorry oh yeah solar flares involve large

417
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,760
amounts of emitted energy

418
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,799
uh in the form of um electromagnetic

419
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,679
radiation so they essentially flashes of

420
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,520
light that

421
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,640
reach the earth in just eight minutes

422
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,520
fortunately they mostly affect only the

423
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,480
upper legs of the atmosphere and do not

424
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
cause any damages to the telescope

425
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
infrastructure

426
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,080
but they do affect satellite

427
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,600
communication

428
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,919
now coronal mass addictions

429
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,480
involve emission of electrically charged

430
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,640
solar matter and the accompanying

431
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,360
magnetic field into the space

432
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,520
and these cmes can take anywhere from 13

433
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,159
hours to five days to reach the earth uh

434
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,039
based on the speed

435
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,520
and these cmes are capable of causing

436
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,080
significant uh damages to testicle

437
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,320
infrastructure so cmes are the focus of

438
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,039
this talk and we'll discuss their impact

439
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,200
more closely soon

440
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,960
both solar flares and uh cmes originate

441
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,480
near uh

442
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,799
temporary dark spots on the sun caused

443
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,200
by concentration of magnetic field flux

444
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,760
and which are sunspots

445
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,600
and when the number of sunspots on the

446
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,919
surface of the sun increases there is a

447
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,159
higher probability of cmes occurring

448
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,480
now how do

449
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,600
how exactly do these cmes affect us

450
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,080
the magnetized uh

451
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,279
cmes are highly directional

452
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,400
and when the earth is in the direct part

453
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,279
of a cme it interacts with the earth's

454
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,720
magnetic field

455
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,520
and induces large electric field on the

456
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,600
earth's surface through electromagnetic

457
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,679
induction

458
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,320
and this can cause geomagnetically

459
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,039
induced currents to flow through long

460
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,039
cables that have ground connections that

461
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,120
are located far apart on the earth's

462
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,039
crust and this could include power

463
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,760
transmission lines oil pipelines and

464
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,559
internet uh cables that have an electric

465
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,840
connection that

466
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,200
spans hundreds of thousands of

467
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,840
kilometers

468
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:12,720
now

469
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,320
next let's look at some of the

470
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,159
characteristics of these induced

471
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,600
currents to better understand the risk

472
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,279
so due to the orientation of the earth's

473
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,840
magnetic field higher latitudes are at a

474
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,399
significantly higher risk and it's for

475
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,200
the same reason that auroras are common

476
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
closer to the poles

477
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,480
and since the um uh

478
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,600
this

479
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,360
impact is caused by interactions with

480
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,840
the earth's magnetic field the induced

481
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,640
currents can affect wide areas and are

482
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,600
not

483
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,440
just restricted to the portion of the

484
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,120
earth that is facing the sun

485
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,640
the gic is only induced in cables with

486
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,440
ground connections and a conductor

487
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,520
where the ground connections are located

488
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,440
far apart on the earth's surface

489
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,919
and finally uh the orientation of the

490
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:06,960
conductor

491
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,520
does not uh impact

492
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,720
the

493
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,840
risk associated with uh gic uh so the

494
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,080
north south or east west

495
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,279
does not influence the induced current

496
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,080
so that was a quick overview

497
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,399
now let's move on to the more important

498
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,080
question

499
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,880
when will a large event that affects the

500
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,440
earth happen next

501
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,200
so solar events are extremely uh hard to

502
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,120
predict just like earthquakes or any

503
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,960
other natural disasters

504
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,200
small scale solar stalls happen all the

505
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,000
time

506
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,480
what we are more interested in are solar

507
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,720
superstorms that can have a significant

508
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,279
impact on our lives

509
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,799
so the largest solar events on record

510
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,039
occurred in 1859 and 1921 long before

511
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,640
the advent of modern technology the 1859

512
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,799
event is popularly known as the

513
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,240
carrington event

514
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,320
and both these events triggered

515
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,440
extensive power outages and caused

516
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,600
significant damage uh to the

517
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,919
communication network of that time which

518
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,480
was the telegraph network

519
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
and the carrington scale event missed

520
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,760
the earth by just a week in 2012 very

521
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,159
recently

522
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,440
now the estimates of uh estimates for

523
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
probability of occurrence of such

524
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,440
extreme space weather events that

525
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,480
directly impact the earth uh ranges from

526
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,399
1.6 percentage to 12 per decade

527
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,760
but that's not all the risk is not

528
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,559
uniform uh across the years

529
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,640
because the solar activity goes through

530
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,600
cycles so here we have the variation in

531
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,080
the number of sunspots across years from

532
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,320
1700 or so to until recently

533
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,200
um and here we can see that the solar

534
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,799
activity waxes and grains in cycles with

535
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,840
a period length of approximately 11

536
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,320
years so during solar maxima there's an

537
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,039
increase in the number of sunspots and

538
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,279
hence an increase in the frequency of

539
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,159
cmes and other solar elements

540
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,360
and it's not just that the solar cyc

541
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,200
solar activity also goes through a

542
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,760
longer term cycle that is approximately

543
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
80 to 100 years

544
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,559
uh so the peak solar activity

545
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,880
very significantly across this 100 year

546
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,240
cycle as well

547
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,960
so this causes the frequency of uh solar

548
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,200
events to vary by a factor of four

549
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,919
across horror maxima uh in this hundred

550
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,080
year cycle

551
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,039
and if we zoom in we can see that modern

552
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,679
technological advancement coincided with

553
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,799
the period of weak solar activity in the

554
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,039
uh past three decades

555
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,480
now we are at the beginning of solar

556
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,360
cycle 25 and the sun is expected to

557
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,000
become more active in the near future

558
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,279
uh but due to the absence of extreme

559
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,840
activity in the recent past we have

560
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
overlooked the impact of these events on

561
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,240
the internet infrastructure

562
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,960
so the bottom line here is that

563
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,360
large event could happen soon and the

564
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,600
impact is enough that we should prepare

565
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,760
our infrastructure for it today we have

566
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
very limited understanding of how this

567
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,158
would affect our internet infrastructure

568
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,080
so how are various internet components

569
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,519
affected

570
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,519
so let's start with a wired

571
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,679
infrastructure

572
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,600
localized infrastructure such as data

573
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,640
centers can be protected from

574
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,679
voltage surges caused by cmes using

575
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,919
transient voltage surge suppressors

576
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,039
which are really relatively inexpensive

577
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,840
so they are mostly safe

578
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,480
now long distance cables constitute the

579
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,880
most vulnerable confidence in the

580
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,120
internet infrastructure

581
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,679
so today we know that long distance land

582
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,159
and submarine cables carry signals in

583
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,600
optical fibers

584
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,159
and this optical fiber itself is immune

585
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,480
to induced currents because it carries

586
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,960
light and not electric current

587
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,399
but these cables also have repeaters at

588
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,600
50 to 150 kilometer intervals

589
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,159
and uh which are connected in series and

590
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,399
powered by a conductor that runs along

591
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,320
the length of the cable

592
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,519
and this conductor is susceptible to

593
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,760
damages from induced currents

594
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,919
so today we don't have any good failure

595
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,399
models for understanding the failure

596
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,600
characteristics of long distance cables

597
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,799
uh but

598
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,200
the expected induced voltages along with

599
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,000
the length of the cable could be uh one

600
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,240
or two orders of magnitude higher than

601
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,919
what the power system associated with

602
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,919
the cable today can is capable of

603
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,519
handling

604
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,760
and today's cables have not been

605
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,679
stressed tested on the uh

606
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,320
induced voltages that could be caused by

607
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,519
a carrington scale event

608
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,760
so long distance cables are in short

609
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,159
vulnerable

610
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,640
internet routers can be protected from

611
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,559
direct voltage surges using voltage

612
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,360
suppressors so most of our localized

613
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,760
infrastructure can be protected so they

614
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,279
are safe

615
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,440
now moving on to wireless infrastructure

616
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,919
um satellites are directly exposed to

617
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,000
solar storms they generally have

618
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,080
radiation shielding for protection from

619
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,880
high energy electrons but with very

620
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,080
strong stones uh these elect it can

621
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,799
cause electrons to penetrate deeper into

622
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,039
the interior regions of satellite

623
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,960
and damage its electronic confidence

624
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,600
and uh solar storms can also cause drag

625
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,159
on satellites which can lead to uh

626
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,799
satellites losing their orbit and

627
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,279
re-entering the atmosphere and burning

628
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,080
up

629
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,200
so very recently uh there was news on 40

630
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,919
starling satellites that were lost to

631
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,159
geomagnetic storm when a small scale

632
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,879
storm hit uh but the uh these satellites

633
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,800
were just being deployed and they were

634
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,440
at lower altitudes where this risk of

635
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,918
drag is much higher um and that's how

636
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,000
they were lost so satellites in general

637
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
are vulnerable and um

638
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,879
and this is well known

639
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,760
uh cell towers are protected from direct

640
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,399
exposure because they're on the um on

641
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,560
the ground and uh protected by the

642
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,079
atmosphere

643
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,960
uh similarly personal devices such as uh

644
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,839
laptops laptops and mobile phones are

645
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,839
also safe

646
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,679
so to summarize long distance cables and

647
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,679
satellites are the most vulnerable

648
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,918
components of the internet

649
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,760
other components could suffer from power

650
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,399
outages but they are not susceptible to

651
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,040
direct damages

652
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,280
now analyzing the uh impact so to

653
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,040
understand the impact on internet

654
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,280
infrastructure i looked at a broad uh

655
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,839
set of data sets uh comprising of

656
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,000
various internet components

657
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,079
so uh the submarine uh cable map

658
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,040
uh

659
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
consists of submarine cables connecting

660
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,640
various continents

661
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,040
and then the itu cable map contains land

662
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
cable information from across the globe

663
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,560
collected from regional entities

664
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,680
intertubes data set

665
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,839
includes long-haul fiber cables in the

666
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,160
us

667
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,480
and then i also looked at publicly

668
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,320
available internet exchange point

669
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,520
locations

670
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,599
dns root server locations

671
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,280
and finally

672
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,960
router locations

673
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,079
with autonomous system mapping

674
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,400
from caira

675
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,560
uh

676
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,040
and here we look at the distribution of

677
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,880
summary in uh

678
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,839
cable endpoints

679
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,119
so we know that uh higher latitudes are

680
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,200
more vulnerable to

681
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,520
induced currents from solar events

682
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,240
particularly latitudes above the 40

683
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
degree threshold so above 40 degree

684
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,560
north and below 40 degree south

685
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,200
so we evaluate the distribution of

686
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,359
infrastructure components in this

687
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,920
range region

688
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
so here we have the

689
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,240
probability density function across

690
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,520
various latitudes plotted on the x-axis

691
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,359
so we look at the distribution of

692
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,480
population

693
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,040
and submarine cable endpoints

694
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,200
and we see that the population is more

695
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,240
concentrated on lower latitudes while

696
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,400
submarine cable endpoints are

697
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,480
concentrated on higher latitudes

698
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,440
especially between the us and europe uh

699
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,079
we see a higher concentration of um

700
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,960
submarine cable uh in points at

701
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,240
more vulnerable regions

702
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,200
now

703
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,680
uh next we look at

704
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,520
distribution of various internet

705
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,079
infrastructure components across

706
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,320
the way across the latitudes

707
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,440
so here

708
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,240
on the x-axis we have the latitude

709
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,359
threshold and on the y-axis we have

710
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,680
concentration of infrastructure

711
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,560
uh complex indeed internet routers xps

712
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,040
or dns root servers above that threshold

713
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,839
so the most vulnerable region is above

714
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,320
the 40 degree threshold which is denoted

715
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,400
by the dotted line here

716
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,520
and here we can see that only about 16

717
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,359
percent of the population is in this

718
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,320
region

719
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,040
but 35 to 45 percent of the internet

720
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,839
infrastructure is in the vulnerable

721
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,520
region and this holds for other

722
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,680
components as well you can see more

723
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,799
analysis in the paper

724
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,000
so the key takeaway here is that

725
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,760
internet infrastructure components are

726
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,240
skewed towards more vulnerable regions

727
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,720
next we look at um cable length analysis

728
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,040
so here on the x-axis

729
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,000
we have a cable length in kilometers in

730
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,280
long scale

731
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,520
so this is the this is a comparison of

732
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,359
cdfs of length of lan cables versus

733
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,599
submarine cables

734
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,280
here the submarine cable data set is

735
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
complete

736
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
it comprises of almost all existing

737
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,000
submarine cables uh the lan cable data

738
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,160
set is not complete but if this was the

739
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,680
largest publicly available data set

740
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,040
so here um

741
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,079
shorter cables don't need repeaters only

742
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,320
cables have a longer than 150 kilometer

743
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,680
need repeaters

744
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,839
and need that conductor along the length

745
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,839
of the cable which is susceptible to

746
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,079
damages so here we observe that

747
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,800
uh more than 70 percent of the land

748
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,200
cables don't need repeaters and hence

749
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,119
are not vulnerable

750
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,400
but only about um 20 percent of the

751
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
submarine cables are shorter than this

752
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,760
threshold

753
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,320
which means that nearly 80 of the

754
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,920
submarine cables

755
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,119
need repeaters and hence are susceptible

756
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,359
to damages from induced currents

757
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,599
so in short submarine cables are more

758
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,119
vulnerable than land cables

759
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,040
and next we also look at um we also

760
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,200
conducted a repeater failure analysis

761
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,839
based on latitude-based failure models

762
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,280
so there were several interesting

763
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,000
observations

764
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,720
the u.s faces a higher risk of losing

765
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,800
connectivity to europe during a solar

766
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,599
superstar so in the east coast most

767
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,680
cables between the us and europe are

768
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,920
concentrated between the northeast and

769
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,800
the northeast of the us and the uk

770
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,319
which is most likely done for lower

771
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,599
latency

772
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,760
and there are no connections from

773
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,880
florida to southern europe which is in

774
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,160
the less vulnerable region

775
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,560
um

776
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,040
but when we look at cables between

777
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,280
brazil and europe um they are less

778
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,520
vulnerable so it was surprising to find

779
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
that the table between brazil and

780
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,079
southern europe is shorter than all

781
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,640
cables between the u.s and raw europe

782
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,400
and it's also located in the less

783
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,480
vulnerable region closer to the equator

784
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,920
in asia singapore has a higher chance of

785
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,000
retaining connectivity to neighboring

786
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,319
countries even under severe storms

787
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,440
because cables are much shorter and also

788
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,480
located in lower latitudes uh that are

789
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,839
less vulnerable

790
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,760
and here we have locations of public

791
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,839
data centers across the globe

792
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,800
red shows a higher density followed by

793
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,480
orange and then blue

794
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,400
so we observed that data centers are

795
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,079
concentrated in

796
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,960
um vulnerable high latitudes

797
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,880
and this observation also holds for

798
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,800
hyperscale providers such as google

799
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,880
facebook microsoft etc

800
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,240
um now while data centers won't suffer

801
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,680
direct damages

802
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,680
access to these data centers can be

803
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,759
affected uh during a solar event

804
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,000
what what other infrastructure

805
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,359
components

806
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,480
so here we have some results on analysis

807
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,319
of on over uh dns and the domain system

808
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,520
and the autonomous systems connectivity

809
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,880
um

810
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,760
dns root servers are highly distributed

811
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,480
and

812
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,160
hence they'll remain reachable even

813
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,880
under very high network partitioning

814
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,440
however location data on top level

815
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,760
domain servers and other authoritative

816
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,920
servers was not available so that

817
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,480
analysis has not been done yet but root

818
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,160
servers are highly distributed and

819
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,240
reachable

820
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,119
when we analyze autonomous systems we

821
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,800
see that a large fraction of asses

822
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,520
have a presence in vulnerable regions

823
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,480
uh

824
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,280
but the vast majority of cases have a

825
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,079
smaller spread

826
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,040
so

827
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,520
next i discuss some of the open

828
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,680
questions and challenges related to this

829
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,000
thread

830
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,440
so the paper my work primarily looked at

831
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,359
internet partitioning based on submarine

832
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,160
cables alone

833
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
understanding the impact on end-to-end

834
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,720
behavior of applications remain an open

835
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
challenge this needs to take into

836
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,119
account both land and submarine cables

837
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,200
and also better failure models for uh

838
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,920
cable failures so currently there are

839
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,720
some geophysicists working on developing

840
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,520
failure models for um internet cables

841
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,040
um

842
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,280
now the primary analysis only looked at

843
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,359
dns root servers to understand

844
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,680
availability of the infrastructure we

845
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,319
need to analyze the distribution of top

846
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,720
top level domain servers and

847
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,119
authoritative servers uh the extent of

848
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,800
caching etc

849
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,960
uh to understand uh the resiliency of

850
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,000
the entire system

851
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,400
another interesting question is how is

852
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,319
as level connectivity affected by

853
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,279
large-scale network partitioning

854
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,640
next we need to devise solutions for

855
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,319
improving long-term resilience of the

856
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,599
infrastructure

857
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,359
for example this could involve um adding

858
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,599
new cables in locations that are less

859
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,000
vulnerable

860
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
uh another interesting

861
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,920
direction could be the design of inter

862
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,920
domain protocols or extension of current

863
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,240
ones to improve path diversity in the

864
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,119
wide area network during um disasters

865
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,000
um another interesting thing with cmes

866
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,920
is that uh the lead type so cmes that

867
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,440
originate at the

868
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,800
on the sun will reach the earth only 13

869
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,599
hours to five days later

870
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,240
so this gives us a sharp interval to

871
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,839
prepare for impact

872
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,839
so how can we use this lead time

873
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,280
effectively

874
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,440
we can develop plans that allow us to

875
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,760
prepare for an impact so maybe we can

876
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,079
cache data across data centers uh

877
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,040
globally in an effective way uh how can

878
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,280
internet service providers react do we

879
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,440
need to increase cash time in the dns

880
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,200
system so there are a lot of interesting

881
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,760
questions on how we can use this lead

882
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,640
time effectively

883
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,000
and um

884
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,480
more importantly um

885
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,800
we also need to rethink our models of

886
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,280
failure analysis so current best

887
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,960
practices on fault tolerance and

888
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,880
resilience evaluation

889
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,040
rely on failure models that consider a

890
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,040
limited number of failures

891
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,440
so we need to test our systems and

892
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
applications under large scale failure

893
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,839
scenarios

894
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,800
another interesting

895
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,760
direction for research is related to uh

896
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,400
reconnecting a partition internet

897
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,280
uh after a solar superstorm the internet

898
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,079
may be partitioned or uh due to failures

899
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,720
in long distance cables or power outages

900
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,520
in certain parts of the globe

901
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,400
um can we look at alternative solutions

902
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,640
that can provide temporary uh

903
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,440
connectivity after an impact so examples

904
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,000
could be uh internet collected balloons

905
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,480
or high altitude platform stations that

906
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,119
are mobile

907
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,359
ideally these solutions should rely on

908
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,760
renewable power sources such as solar

909
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,839
energy to guarantee connectivity even

910
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,079
during power outages so that's another

911
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,040
interesting direction of research

912
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,400
um finally internet and power grids are

913
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,839
both uh designated as uniquely critical

914
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,400
because all other critical systems rely

915
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,440
on them

916
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,200
they are also in their dependent on each

917
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,520
other and both are susceptible to

918
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,760
failures from solar superstorms

919
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,160
hence we need to study the joint failure

920
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,800
characteristics of this complex in the

921
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,319
dependent system

922
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:39,200
um

923
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,280
they also have very different failure

924
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,960
characteristics for example if we

925
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,960
consider the united states there are

926
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,359
three regional power grids the western

927
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,040
interconnection eastern interconnection

928
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,760
and texas interconnect

929
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,240
now if the power grid in the east face

930
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,560
it only it will not cause any

931
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,920
significant effects or overload on uh

932
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,760
the western in the connection

933
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,480
but on the other hand if all cables

934
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,680
connecting to uh the east coast fail

935
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,319
um there'll be significant shifts in bgp

936
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,280
paths and potential overload in uh

937
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,880
cables on the west coast

938
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,680
so

939
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,680
internet is more global compared to

940
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,480
power grids and even regional failures

941
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,440
can result in significant consequences

942
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,119
for the broader internet

943
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,200
so understanding the interdependency is

944
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,119
an interesting question

945
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,200
so these are just a few open problems

946
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,280
there are many more

947
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,680
uh now to summarize

948
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,680
um

949
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,119
so space weather particularly coronal

950
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,920
mass ejections from the sun pose a

951
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,599
significant risk to our internet

952
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,359
infrastructure

953
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,559
uh

954
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:49,440
and

955
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,440
modern technological advancement

956
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,520
coincided with the period of weak solar

957
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,680
activity so the internet infrastructure

958
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,079
has not been stress tested under strong

959
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,319
solar events

960
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,240
and the complete um

961
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,200
extent of this threat is yet to be

962
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,599
estimated

963
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,960
uh international infrastructure

964
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,880
components are skewed towards highly

965
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,720
vulnerable regions in the higher

966
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,880
latitudes and this can affect the

967
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,800
overall resilience of the system based

968
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,640
on preliminary analysis but a lot more

969
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,160
work needs to be done in this context

970
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,559
and finally we need to work towards

971
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,800
better understanding and improving the

972
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,880
resilience of the global internet

973
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,680
infrastructure um with that i'll

974
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,839
conclude my talk thank you and i'm happy

975
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,640
to take questions

976
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,760
okay thank you

977
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,880
computer

978
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,920
very interesting talk

979
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,440
really interesting problem you're

980
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,200
looking at here

981
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,400
um

982
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,839
wes do you have a question

983
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,040
i do

984
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,720
uh so first off thank you for the

985
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,920
excellent work

986
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,760
i'm a ham radio operator and we'll pass

987
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,800
this on to some friends that are

988
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,640
interested in it because we we consider

989
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,480
that type of stuff all the time

990
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,000
there's a number of ham radio operators

991
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,960
in the atf um i'm also a root server

992
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,800
operator and so one of the things that

993
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,280
i'm interested in is is it's worth

994
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,839
noting first off that the root instances

995
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,640
or dns instances you know may be that

996
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,119
their particular installation does not

997
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,599
you know pose a problem but if they

998
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,160
become disconnected from the rest of the

999
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,680
system then they will fail to get

1000
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,240
updates at which point dns will stop you

1001
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,960
know uh validating after you know a

1002
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,280
while as the signatures expire in the

1003
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,160
regardless of the zone um did you study

1004
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,359
islands did you find you know isolated

1005
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,680
islands of

1006
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,200
communication where

1007
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,040
they would be functionally cut off i

1008
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,640
mean the nice thing about the routing

1009
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,400
system is that you know if a major cable

1010
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,920
gets taken out but maybe there's a link

1011
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
to greenland to you know something like

1012
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,280
that that you can actually still get

1013
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,359
traffic through it'll become congested

1014
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,400
but did you

1015
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
were you able to identify any uh

1016
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,240
particular areas that are completely

1017
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,119
shut off where you know they'd be dis

1018
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,559
completely cut off from communication

1019
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,079
for a while

1020
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,680
yeah that's a that's a very important

1021
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,400
question

1022
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,079
uh so i don't have a

1023
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,640
complete answer yet so my my initial

1024
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,800
paper only looked at uh

1025
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,440
primary regions of uh uh that will be

1026
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,359
affected but not the end-to-end

1027
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,839
disconnection on the complete graph uh

1028
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,520
so currently i have students that are

1029
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,079
working on this topic uh so i don't have

1030
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,599
a complete answer yet but um

1031
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,079
it could be possible that there are very

1032
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,599
big islands but not um

1033
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,559
and uh not a lot of tiny islands it

1034
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,400
seems like uh so that based on the

1035
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,240
preliminary analysis

1036
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,119
most of asia and so the asia to europe

1037
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,200
connection will probably stay

1038
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,520
but uh the us uh to europe might be more

1039
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,200
affected uh so uh complete disconnection

1040
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,920
uh i don't know at this point but a

1041
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
significant reduction in capacity

1042
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,520
between the

1043
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,839
bigger land masses is possible

1044
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,880
okay thank you

1045
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,200
anyone else have questions first indeed

1046
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,000
a little bit of chat about its uh

1047
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,400
vulnerability of satellites in in the

1048
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,240
chat um

1049
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,839
i don't know if you saw that

1050
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,599
yeah so yeah

1051
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,839
question on um

1052
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:00,240
uh the satellite impact on satellites

1053
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,280
there are radio solar storms and apart

1054
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,440
from starting accident with very low

1055
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,680
earth orbit satellites satellites are

1056
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,839
fine do you have pointers to justify the

1057
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,760
assumptions on satellites to be honest

1058
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,680
yeah so that's a very important question

1059
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,880
um

1060
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,599
so

1061
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,720
uh

1062
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,400
as i mentioned in the talk these

1063
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,520
satellites have protective covering so

1064
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,720
uh so uh typically

1065
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,599
they're deployed they have a child that

1066
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,160
can protect them from solar activity for

1067
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,920
their lifespan which is five to ten

1068
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,200
years or so

1069
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,119
so uh it was only in the past decade or

1070
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,760
two that the number of satellites grew

1071
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,480
really exponentially uh and we have not

1072
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,200
had a very large storm since then

1073
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,040
so the startling satellites were

1074
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,440
affected because uh after they were

1075
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,319
installed at the lower altitude than

1076
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,960
their final orbit um

1077
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,599
to back to back very small scale formed

1078
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,079
happen uh storms happened so uh the

1079
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,640
solas uh storms are arranged uh uh the

1080
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,680
the

1081
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,480
the uh intensity of these stones they

1082
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,839
are uh

1083
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,119
they range from g1 to g5 where g1 being

1084
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,359
the weakest and g5 being the strongest

1085
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,359
so the storms that hit the starting

1086
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,599
satellites were g1 which were really

1087
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,480
weak

1088
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,480
but it took down the satellites because

1089
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,559
the satellites were at a lower altitude

1090
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:27,359
than

1091
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,559
their final destination altitude

1092
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,440
now

1093
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,559
if a g5 which is the most intense storm

1094
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,680
happens

1095
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,319
we don't know the impact what the impact

1096
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:42,000
would be um at even the current uh

1097
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,359
orbital altitudes so uh the radiation

1098
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:46,880
shielding can offer some amount of

1099
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,000
protection but it's not guaranteed that

1100
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,640
um they'll be completely protected and

1101
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,359
not just that um these satellites fall

1102
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,839
out of orbit very often and they have

1103
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,079
mechanisms to uh they have thrusters

1104
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,880
that will take them back to orbit and to

1105
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,200
in order to do that we need to we need

1106
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,280
to have connection with the earth ground

1107
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,520
stations which can detect the current

1108
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,359
altitude and correct the uh satellite's

1109
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,400
position and the solar storm can um

1110
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,280
extend for hours maybe 10 to 12 hours in

1111
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,240
the case of varying storms so if we lose

1112
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,640
connectivity to a satellite for such

1113
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,559
extended periods and they fall out of

1114
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,599
orbit uh it is possible that uh they

1115
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,040
could fall even though there are

1116
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,040
thrusters if we cannot communicate with

1117
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,160
the satellites they could get damaged so

1118
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,240
before the current international space

1119
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,839
station was installed u.s had um

1120
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,599
something called sky lab

1121
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,480
which was the previous space station uh

1122
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,720
and that was destroyed in the 1970s

1123
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,760
during a uh large solar storm

1124
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,720
and they couldn't connect with it uh to

1125
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,440
push push it back up into the orbit so

1126
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,520
with very large storms that extend for

1127
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,400
hours

1128
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,559
it is possible that uh satellites could

1129
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,880
be destroyed but we don't we have not

1130
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,760
experienced something that large uh very

1131
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,319
recently

1132
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,160
does that answer your question or are

1133
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,118
there any questions

1134
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,440
yeah so there is a question on uh is the

1135
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,079
uh impact focused on high latitude or

1136
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,559
sun facing side or are induced currents

1137
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,520
the same globally so when it comes to

1138
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,319
the direct uh impact on satellites

1139
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,160
satellites that are facing the sun are

1140
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,839
at a much higher risk

1141
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,160
but when we look at the induced currents

1142
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,400
these are caused by interaction of these

1143
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,000
magnetic particles

1144
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,760
with the

1145
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,559
uh earth's magnetic field so in the case

1146
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,520
of induced currents um

1147
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,520
it's not just the sun facing side the

1148
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,640
dark side is also equally vulnerable but

1149
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,319
higher latitudes uh on both uh the sun

1150
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,720
facing side as well as the dark side are

1151
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,839
equally vulnerable

1152
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,240
okay

1153
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,960
thank you i i had a question i mean

1154
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,599
since this is an a etf an irtf meeting

1155
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,520
is there anything we should be doing

1156
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,079
differently when we design protocols

1157
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,319
which would help with this type of you

1158
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,839
know help with resilience to this type

1159
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,920
of event

1160
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,839
yeah so uh i i think they need to

1161
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,359
rethink uh resilience at every layer of

1162
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,520
the uh stack so uh with dns as i said

1163
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,440
like we know that root servers are uh

1164
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,520
very very well distributed but we don't

1165
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,960
know how the

1166
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,359
entire uh tree would hierarchical tree

1167
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,720
would uh

1168
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,720
kind of fare under a solar storm do we

1169
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,359
need to change our caching intervals or

1170
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,880
uh change how we uh manage these dns

1171
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,200
records that's not clear and then when

1172
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,319
it comes to protocols it seems like vgp

1173
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,359
which allows only like a single path um

1174
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,200
that might be too restrictive when the

1175
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,760
capacity is severely limited

1176
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,920
so that's another analysis that we what

1177
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,760
we plan to do like how how would um um

1178
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,079
bgp affair uh in such a scenario uh but

1179
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,799
uh within an as like um ospf or um the

1180
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,520
other entire routing protocols will

1181
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,280
fare very well because they are

1182
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,359
decentralized and they can use whatever

1183
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,200
parts are available uh in a

1184
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,440
decentralized fashion so they seem

1185
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,599
mostly safe it's the in their domain

1186
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,040
protocol that needs more investigation

1187
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,200
uh yeah okay

1188
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,040
that makes sense i guess there's a whole

1189
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,960
bunch of coordination issues and

1190
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,160
management issues with large-scale um

1191
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,559
circuit click cloud cloud provider

1192
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,160
infrastructure networks and so on as

1193
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,920
well yeah

1194
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,040
yeah so

1195
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,079
some interesting problems yeah

1196
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,960
okay uh other yeah other questions for

1197
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,200
senjita should we move on to the other

1198
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,200
talk

1199
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,240
dtn over rfc 1149 is clearly the answer

1200
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,359
you've seen that saving carriers

1201
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,559
okay uh i guess there are no more

1202
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,960
questions so uh in that case uh thank

1203
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,300
you sanjuta excellent talk

1204
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,040
[Applause]

1205
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,359
thank yeah

1206
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,160
all right uh next up

1207
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,200
is

1208
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,359
uh bruce spang

1209
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,400
uh

1210
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,040
bruce there yes

1211
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,079
uh so the second award uh today goes to

1212
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,880
bruce spang uh for his work showing that

1213
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,359
networking algorithm a b tests uh can be

1214
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,559
biased because of network congestion

1215
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,760
uh bruce is a fifth year phd candidate

1216
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,720
at stanford uh studying uh internet

1217
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,319
networking video streaming and

1218
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,319
theoretical computer science uh he's

1219
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,240
also been a graduate research fellow at

1220
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,559
netflix for the past three years

1221
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,119
uh working on video algorithms

1222
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,000
uh and in in the past he studied at um

1223
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,160
umass amherst and also worked as a

1224
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,720
software engineer at fastly

1225
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,319
the paper he'll be presenting today is

1226
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,160
unbiased experiments in congested

1227
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,960
networks which was originally presented

1228
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,480
at the acm internet measurement

1229
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,720
conference last year

1230
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,400
um bruce you should be able to press the

1231
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,640
share pre-loaded slides

1232
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,400
button

1233
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,920
great

1234
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,000
just shares and stuff no slides not the

1235
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,040
screen just next to it instead just for

1236
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,760
your animation itself

1237
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,079
uh it works better if you can do it with

1238
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,839
the slides but so we can do the screen

1239
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,799
if let me give that a go

1240
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,520
okay uh already when you're

1241
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,359
great

1242
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,480
well uh thanks so much for the

1243
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,480
introduction um and i guess first off i

1244
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,839
wanted to start by saying thank you so

1245
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,599
thank you so much for this award

1246
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,839
um some of my all-time favorite research

1247
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,280
papers have received this award and so

1248
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,040
i'm really honored that our work is also

1249
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,960
receiving this award

1250
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,799
our work is about running experiments in

1251
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,559
congested networks

1252
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,000
um and this is some joint work with

1253
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,200
veronica hannan trivia kunamala gy hwang

1254
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,880
from netflix and my advisor is nick

1255
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,880
mckeown and ramesh jahari from stanford

1256
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,559
so we're talking about networking

1257
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,319
research and it's very common in

1258
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:45,760
networking research that we come up with

1259
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,160
some new algorithm and we want to argue

1260
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,920
that this new algorithm is better than

1261
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,720
the existing state of the art

1262
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,480
so we've got a pretty typical way that

1263
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,520
we do this and normally we come up with

1264
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,280
some intuition about why the new album

1265
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,960
is better maybe we run some lab

1266
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,799
experiments that show specific instances

1267
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,960
where the new algorithm is better

1268
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,480
and then finally we'll go and we'll run

1269
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,200
a production a b test so like a

1270
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
randomized experiment on actual traffic

1271
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,640
where we try out our new algorithm and

1272
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,839
see if it actually works well in

1273
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,599
practice

1274
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,040
so this is a pretty standard way to

1275
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,119
evaluate algorithms um on the slide are

1276
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,040
a couple of papers from the past decade

1277
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,119
or so where they rely on an ab test to

1278
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,559
argue that their approach is better than

1279
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,720
the state of the art

1280
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,200
and so this is just a subset of the the

1281
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,200
papers that have been published and also

1282
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,960
there's lots of unpublished work so the

1283
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,680
team that we work with pretty closely at

1284
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,440
they run an av test to test basically

1285
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,720
every single change they make to the

1286
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,559
production algorithm and probably over

1287
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:43,599
the course of the

1288
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,200
year they'll run a couple thousand ap

1289
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,040
tests

1290
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,040
so what is an av test

1291
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,599
so in a b test we have a whole bunch of

1292
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:52,720
users

1293
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,599
and so

1294
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,960
uh there's

1295
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,280
normally a bunch of smiley faces on this

1296
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,119
slide so imagine a bunch of smiley faces

1297
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,960
here these smiley faces are going to be

1298
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,720
units and these units

1299
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,319
are something like users they're like

1300
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:05,599
video sessions

1301
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,920
their servers and what we do is we

1302
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,319
randomly assign traffic to

1303
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,799
either treatment or control

1304
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,839
we wait for a while we collect some data

1305
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,240
and then we look at the outcomes

1306
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,039
and so the outcomes um

1307
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,480
maybe in this case the treatment

1308
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,000
algorithm gets better performance than

1309
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,240
the control algorithm and so we say okay

1310
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,760
we've run a randomized experiment we

1311
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,200
found that the algorithm improves

1312
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,759
performance

1313
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,880
so this uh is a generalization this

1314
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,480
statement that an algorithm improves

1315
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,480
performance we're kind of making a

1316
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,240
statement about what the world would be

1317
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,760
like if we went and deployed the

1318
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,079
algorithm based on the results of an a b

1319
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,079
test and typically an a b test is like a

1320
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,559
pretty small scale experiment maybe one

1321
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,160
percent or less than one percent of

1322
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,879
global traffic

1323
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,079
so this is a fine sort of generalization

1324
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,839
to make but it's a generalization that

1325
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,680
requires some assumptions

1326
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,359
and one of the big assumptions is that

1327
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,440
the outcome of one unit in the test

1328
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,280
doesn't depend on the other units in the

1329
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,280
test so for instance like what happens

1330
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,799
to me when treatment is applied to me

1331
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,160
doesn't matter if treatment is applied

1332
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,079
to you

1333
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,359
so this assumption this is called

1334
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:14,720
interference

1335
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,799
and when interference is present units

1336
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,400
sort of interfere with other units in

1337
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,319
the test and this can bias the outcome

1338
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,200
of a b tests

1339
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,440
so this is sort of a hot topic in an

1340
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,119
area called causal inference which is a

1341
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,400
field of research where we think about

1342
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,240
like experiments and how we know what we

1343
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,480
know is true is true

1344
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,920
and so let me give you a couple examples

1345
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,680
of this sort of interference

1346
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,280
so let's imagine you've got some social

1347
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,520
network and you've got like a messaging

1348
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,520
application for this social network and

1349
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,880
you want to test some new feature for

1350
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,359
this messaging application

1351
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,359
if you randomize users to treatment and

1352
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:48,960
control and this this feature does

1353
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,880
something that like increases usage for

1354
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,480
the treatment group

1355
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,960
then uh maybe this user who's in the

1356
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,400
treatment group goes and messages all

1357
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,599
their friends who are in the control

1358
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,200
group and this will sort of increase

1359
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,880
usage for both the treatment and control

1360
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,480
groups and this will bias the outcome of

1361
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,559
the test

1362
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,799
another example is from online options

1363
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,079
or markets and you can think of like

1364
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,240
ebay or airbnb here

1365
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,920
if you've got users that are randomly

1366
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,280
assigned to treatment and control and

1367
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,880
then they compete against each other in

1368
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,720
some sort of auction or to buy some sort

1369
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,000
of product

1370
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,440
then if you do something that makes

1371
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,599
treatment users more likely to win this

1372
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,440
option then it makes control users more

1373
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,680
likely to lose this option and again you

1374
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,280
have this interference between treatment

1375
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,680
and control

1376
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,720
there's a lot more examples of

1377
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,200
interference out there we've got a link

1378
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,280
to all sorts of papers in the in the

1379
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,640
presentation or in the paper

1380
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,520
so if we think about it for just a

1381
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,520
little bit i mean this is the ritf we're

1382
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,280
talking about networking

1383
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,400
um

1384
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,680
it should become pretty clear that

1385
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,280
interference exists in congested

1386
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,319
networks

1387
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,839
so we've got treatment traffic and

1388
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,480
control traffic in an a b test and this

1389
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,119
traffic shares the internet it shares

1390
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,039
networks in the internet it shares cues

1391
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,799
in the networks routers and the networks

1392
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,640
and links in the network

1393
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,280
and there are things that we know from

1394
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,280
say congestion control research that the

1395
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,119
treatment algorithm can do

1396
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,039
to affect the network so it can do

1397
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,200
things like increase or decrease the

1398
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,880
length of the cues in the network it can

1399
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,480
do things like use more or less

1400
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,760
bandwidth

1401
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,200
and if it does this it'll impact the

1402
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,520
control algorithm

1403
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,880
like the control algorithm could see the

1404
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,559
longer q user could have less bandwidth

1405
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,280
available to it

1406
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,680
so interference clearly exists in

1407
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,839
congested networks

1408
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,319
but the question is it sort of raises

1409
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,559
two questions the first question is like

1410
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:37,920
does this matter

1411
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,119
so maybe there's a little bit of

1412
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,880
interference a little bit of bias but it

1413
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,400
doesn't really change the outcome of the

1414
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,799
test we run at all

1415
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,240
or maybe it does and maybe it actually

1416
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,920
would sort of significantly change the

1417
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,599
decisions even we would make as a result

1418
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,160
of these tests

1419
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,039
so

1420
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,400
the first question is does it matter and

1421
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,680
if it does matter then what can we do

1422
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,119
about it is there any way we can avoid

1423
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,960
this bias and so in our work we try and

1424
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,240
answer both of these questions

1425
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,319
let me start with the first question and

1426
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:05,920
tell you about an experiment we ran that

1427
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,440
shows that a b test can be extremely

1428
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,039
misleading if there's congestion

1429
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,920
interference present

1430
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,839
so this experiment uh we ran in

1431
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,599
cooperation with netflix and it was an

1432
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,359
experiment involving bit rate capping so

1433
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:20,559
first let me tell you about what bit

1434
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,400
rate capping is

1435
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,960
so back at the beginning of profit 19

1436
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,799
everyone started staying home load on

1437
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,799
the internet went way up

1438
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:31,039
and governments around the world worked

1439
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,720
with large video streaming services like

1440
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,000
netflix

1441
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,400
to reduce load on the internet

1442
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,000
and the way they did this was by capping

1443
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,160
bit rates

1444
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,839
and overall this reduced the load that

1445
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:45,760
netflix was sending out by about 25

1446
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,000
so what did this mean technically

1447
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,960
um

1448
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,720
so netflix videos are split up into

1449
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,319
segments in each segment you can think

1450
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,000
about as a couple different seconds of

1451
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,119
video

1452
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,039
each segment is encoded at a number of

1453
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,319
different qualities

1454
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,480
there's a very high quality one which

1455
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,400
looks good but tends to be pretty large

1456
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,400
in terms of bytes then there's a range

1457
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,079
of qualities that goes down to some low

1458
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,039
quality which is looks less good but is

1459
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,960
like much smaller and faster to transfer

1460
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,520
so an algorithm goes and it can pick

1461
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,880
each quality level at each segment and

1462
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,319
then at the next segment it can pick a

1463
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,480
different quality level

1464
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,480
for bitrate capping what netflix did was

1465
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,400
just stop serving the highest quality

1466
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,440
levels so they just got rid of those

1467
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,200
um and so for the same sort of seconds

1468
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,799
of video the number of bites he sent

1469
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,160
would be lower

1470
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,359
and there's a whole bunch of technical

1471
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:34,960
details here about how to do this while

1472
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,720
respecting the various like plans that

1473
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,319
people had paid for and the quality that

1474
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:39,920
netflix had promised

1475
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,200
um and you can read more about that in

1476
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,359
the paper if you're interested

1477
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,440
but uh at a very high level netflix

1478
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,839
limited the quality of video and this

1479
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,680
reduced the uh

1480
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,640
the overall traffic

1481
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,119
so this is a an algorithm that we could

1482
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,119
test out and i think it's a pretty

1483
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,200
natural question to ask is like okay so

1484
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,960
let's say we did run an a b test for

1485
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,240
this algorithm

1486
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,280
what would an a b test look like

1487
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,319
so

1488
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,079
let's imagine we've got some congested

1489
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,160
link so this link up here on the top

1490
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,520
left

1491
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,119
and we're thinking about a congested

1492
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,400
link here because the whole point of

1493
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,839
this bit rate capping thing was to

1494
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,238
reduce congestion in the first place

1495
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,679
so let's imagine we took all the traffic

1496
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,839
to this link and capped this traffic

1497
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,600
so this would reduce the bandwidth usage

1498
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,880
and let's say in this case it will

1499
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,520
reduce the bandwidth usage by half

1500
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,040
and what this means is that now there's

1501
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,719
some free space available on this link

1502
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,120
and the link will become not congested

1503
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,799
so there's sort of two treatment effects

1504
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,238
here of bitrate capping that we're

1505
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,479
interested in measuring the first one is

1506
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,479
how much less bandwidth we're using

1507
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:41,920
and then the second one is how this

1508
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,880
impacts congestion

1509
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,560
so if we were to go and we were to run

1510
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,759
an a b test one possibility is that so

1511
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,439
we've got this captain control traffic

1512
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,439
which is sharing a link

1513
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,839
the cap traffic could sort of reduce the

1514
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,439
data that it's sending the control

1515
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,439
traffic could be not effective and there

1516
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,040
could be some free space available on

1517
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:01,920
the link

1518
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,359
and in this case the link would be not

1519
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,359
congested

1520
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,359
so in a b test the results that we would

1521
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,279
see is that the cap traffic would use

1522
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,439
less bandwidth than the control traffic

1523
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,359
in fact here it uses the correct ratio

1524
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,040
of less bandwidth so it's using half as

1525
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,600
much bandwidth as the control traffic

1526
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,759
but what we wouldn't see is the impact

1527
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:22,080
on congestion

1528
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,158
because we would be comparing the cap

1529
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,000
traffic to the control traffic and

1530
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,439
they're using the same link which is not

1531
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,600
congested and so we would see similar

1532
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,120
metrics for congestion we'd see similar

1533
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,640
packet loss we would see similar viewing

1534
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,839
delay and so on

1535
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,839
a second possibility if we were to run

1536
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,679
an a b test is that the control

1537
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,279
algorithm could be running some sort of

1538
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:42,719
conjunction control algorithm it could

1539
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,399
be doing some sort of adaptive bit-rate

1540
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,000
algorithm and i could notice that

1541
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,600
there's some free space available on the

1542
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,600
link and it could start sending faster

1543
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,080
or higher quality data and fill up the

1544
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,839
rest of the link

1545
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,360
in this situation the link could stay

1546
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,679
congested and in the result of an a b

1547
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,440
test what we would see is that the cap

1548
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,760
traffic is using less bandwidth sort of

1549
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,040
directionally we've got the right

1550
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,880
direction but here we will get the wrong

1551
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,719
ratio so we'll see that it's using about

1552
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,159
a third as much bandwidth instead of

1553
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:11,040
half as much bandwidth

1554
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,719
and then secondly we're also going to

1555
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,800
miss this impact on congestion

1556
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,400
because both again the captain control

1557
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,840
traffic are going to be using the same

1558
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,199
link which is going to be congested

1559
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:22,880
and so in both of these situations when

1560
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,480
we run an a b test we're not going to

1561
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,320
see what happens with congestion and

1562
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,760
this is sort of a huge bummer because

1563
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,120
the whole point of this algorithm in the

1564
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,640
first place was to reduce congestion

1565
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,760
so now i'd like to tell you about an

1566
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,800
experiment we ran to measure congestion

1567
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,199
uh to measure the sort of actual effect

1568
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,719
of bit rate counting

1569
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:46,080
and in order to do that i need to

1570
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,760
describe the experiment i rented to you

1571
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,440
and in order to do that let me introduce

1572
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,719
another way of thinking about the same

1573
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,159
thing that might make the experiment

1574
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,199
design a little bit cleaner

1575
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:56,960
so let's imagine we're in this setting

1576
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,800
back here on the right hand side where

1577
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,560
the control traffic is going to respond

1578
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,080
to the amount of cap traffic and sort of

1579
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,199
fill up the rest of the link

1580
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,840
so in this setting uh we can visualize

1581
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,080
the behavior as follows so on the x-axis

1582
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,040
here is the fraction of cap traffic

1583
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,120
on the y-axis is a measurement of per

1584
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,560
session throughput and so we've got a

1585
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,159
bunch of different video sessions here

1586
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,000
that are sharing one link and so we can

1587
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,520
look at a per session throughput for

1588
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,600
those video sessions

1589
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,960
this line here this is going to be the

1590
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,800
throughput for the cap sessions

1591
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,560
and it doesn't depend on the fraction of

1592
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,719
traffic which is kept because there's

1593
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,880
some sort of upper limit that we send at

1594
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,400
and as we increase the fraction of

1595
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,679
traffic which is capped there'll be more

1596
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,120
space available on the link and so we'll

1597
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,480
continue sending at this upper level

1598
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,159
this line here this is the throughput

1599
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,080
for the control algorithm the algorithm

1600
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,080
which is not doing bit rate capping and

1601
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,600
as more and more traffic is capped we're

1602
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,640
going to be back in the setting where

1603
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,239
the control traffic is going to increase

1604
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,199
the throughput that it gets

1605
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,280
so what we're interested in measuring

1606
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,880
here is what happens if we were to go

1607
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,440
and we were to deploy battery capping so

1608
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,440
that's the difference between 100 of

1609
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,760
traffic is capped which is over here

1610
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,360
on the right hand side

1611
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,360
100 of traffic is running the control

1612
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,880
algorithm which is over here on the left

1613
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,000
hand side

1614
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,280
and the difference between these two

1615
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,880
points we call the total treatment

1616
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,719
effect and this is sort of the quantity

1617
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,920
that we're interested in measuring

1618
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,800
if we were to go run an av test we would

1619
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,239
not necessarily measure the total

1620
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:23,520
treatment effect

1621
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,960
instead what we would do is we would

1622
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,040
pick one point on the x-axis where we

1623
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,880
allocate some fraction of traffic to

1624
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,719
treatment and control and then we would

1625
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,960
compare the two points vertically along

1626
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,520
this line so we could run this 50 a b

1627
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,880
test and we could look at the difference

1628
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,640
between cap and control along this line

1629
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,239
as you can see from the graph this is

1630
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,760
just uh

1631
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,920
one point and it's a might be a biased

1632
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,360
estimate of the total treatment effect

1633
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,120
so here there's some bias and this can

1634
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,480
make our estimate of the total treatment

1635
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,360
correct incorrect

1636
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,320
so sort of the problem here is that

1637
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,400
we're just looking at one point

1638
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,840
and if we start looking at multiple

1639
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,040
points um we can measure capping effects

1640
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,600
and compare this to the biased ap tests

1641
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,880
so let's say we did the following let's

1642
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,040
say we could somehow run a five percent

1643
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,600
a b test and a 95 a b test

1644
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,120
simultaneously

1645
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,120
then we've got four points on this graph

1646
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:19,920
here

1647
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,080
and we could compare this like point on

1648
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,080
the far left over here when five percent

1649
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,480
of traffic is capped or 95 percent of

1650
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,640
traffic is not capped to this point over

1651
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,800
here on the right where 95 of traffic is

1652
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,719
kept so this is sort of when we're

1653
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:34,960
switching from most traffic not cap to

1654
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,960
most traffic capped and we can use this

1655
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,239
as an approximation of the total

1656
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:39,600
treatment effect

1657
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,719
and then we can compare that

1658
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:42,239
approximation to the results of these

1659
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,159
two ap tests and we could get an

1660
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:47,799
estimate of the bias

1661
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,400
so this is going to be our goal one

1662
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,560
thing that is tends to confuse people

1663
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,199
about this is why here are we picking a

1664
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,960
five percent and a ninety-five percent a

1665
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,000
b test

1666
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,159
instead of say a hundred percent and a

1667
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,920
zero percent because the total treatment

1668
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,520
effect is the difference between over

1669
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,520
here on the left zero percent and over

1670
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,480
here on the right 100

1671
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,840
the reason we're doing this here is

1672
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,600
because we're also really interested in

1673
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,000
measuring the bias of kp tests and if we

1674
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,920
were to pick this allocation of 100 and

1675
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,760
zero percent we wouldn't have a b test

1676
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,040
to compare it to

1677
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,400
so this uh we thought was a nice

1678
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,000
compromise between coming up with an

1679
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,760
approximation of the overall effect of

1680
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,520
deploying bit rate counting and then

1681
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,120
also still having a b test that we could

1682
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,840
compare against

1683
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,760
so this is going to be our goal um the

1684
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,679
real crux of measuring this though is

1685
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,040
going to be to run these two

1686
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,360
simultaneous experiments

1687
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,719
and the problem is like as soon as we

1688
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,320
start running this five percent test

1689
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,760
like it's going to be difficult to run a

1690
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,840
95 test because

1691
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,520
kind of we're allocating the same

1692
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,920
traffic

1693
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:50,320
so this is where we got extremely lucky

1694
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,600
and so

1695
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,040
netflix has this content delivery

1696
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,120
network called open connect and open

1697
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,280
connect has a bunch of servers located

1698
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,640
all around the world

1699
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,320
that connect with different isps

1700
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,880
we found this one location that had a

1701
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,199
pair of very reliably congested peering

1702
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,840
links to the same

1703
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,840
so there's this isp there were these two

1704
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,360
links and then there were two routers

1705
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,960
and sets of servers that were connected

1706
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,440
to those routers

1707
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,440
these two links were very very similar

1708
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,080
so we had the same set of servers

1709
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,920
connected to the links the same routers

1710
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,719
here

1711
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,960
uh the same isp the same content was

1712
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,120
available on all of the servers

1713
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,480
and when we learned and looked at

1714
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,920
historical data we saw like no

1715
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,440
significant differences between the two

1716
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,800
links and most of the metrics that we

1717
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,800
cared about

1718
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,960
so these two links uh were

1719
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,719
both congested both pretty separate from

1720
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:42,560
each other and so what we could do is we

1721
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,800
could run one a b test here on these

1722
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,640
treatment servers and look at how it

1723
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,800
impacted the congestion on link one

1724
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,159
and then we could run a separate test on

1725
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,520
the control servers and look how it

1726
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,719
impacted the congestion on link two

1727
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,640
and so this is what we did we went on

1728
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,000
link one and we ran a test where

1729
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,280
ninety-five percent of traffic was

1730
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,360
capped and a link to we ran a test where

1731
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,679
five percent of traffic was kept

1732
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,920
this gave us those two experiments those

1733
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,360
four points from before and we could

1734
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,880
look at and compare the difference

1735
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,520
between these two things

1736
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,960
so now let me tell you about the results

1737
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,679
of the experiment

1738
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:16,560
so

1739
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,239
this is a similar graph to what we saw

1740
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,159
before on the x-axis is the fraction of

1741
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,880
traffic which is kept on the y-axis is a

1742
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,560
measure of normalized throughput in this

1743
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,080
experiment

1744
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,560
what we saw was in each a b test we saw

1745
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,480
about a five percent decrease in the

1746
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,320
throughput so capping decreased

1747
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,560
throughput by about five percent

1748
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,400
but overall when we compared these two

1749
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,840
treatments we saw an improvement of

1750
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,920
about 12 percent in throughput

1751
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,520
so when we switched most traffic from

1752
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,600
not cap to cap throughput went up by

1753
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,080
about 12 percent

1754
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,920
so

1755
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,280
the important thing here is that the av

1756
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,800
tests are biased and they're not just

1757
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,480
sort of like kind of biased like even

1758
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,159
the direction of improvement is wrong

1759
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,840
so this is i think uh

1760
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,800
surprising and one

1761
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,640
thing that might make this a little bit

1762
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,400
clearer

1763
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,159
is if we look at the behavior of

1764
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,800
throughput as a time series

1765
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,560
so over here on the left is a time

1766
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,080
series of throughput before the

1767
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,199
experiment

1768
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,280
we've got two links and as you can see

1769
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,120
the two links have pretty much identical

1770
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,880
throughput over time

1771
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,520
over the course of the entire day

1772
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,440
during these peak hours which we shaded

1773
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,199
here these are the hours of the evening

1774
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,120
load increases

1775
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,800
at some point congestion sets in and

1776
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,239
when congestion sets in throughput

1777
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:36,320
decreases pretty significantly

1778
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,800
and then it goes back up to normal

1779
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,400
so during the experiment we again have

1780
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,840
these two links

1781
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,679
uh and this time the links are split

1782
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,320
between capped and uncapped traffic

1783
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,320
again we see during off-peak hours the

1784
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,400
links are both pretty similar

1785
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,000
but during peak hours we start to see a

1786
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,239
difference between these two links

1787
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:57,280
so these top two lines here this is the

1788
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,440
first link where 95 of traffic is kept

1789
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,440
and the bottom two are the other link

1790
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,120
where five percent of traffic is capped

1791
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,560
because we're doing capping here uh

1792
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,480
there's sort of less data that we're

1793
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,159
sending and in order for the link to be

1794
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:13,520
congested we're going to need higher

1795
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,320
load

1796
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,840
and that higher load will happen later

1797
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,920
in the day so when we cap we delay the

1798
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,760
onset of congestion for the link which

1799
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,159
is count and we also make congestion end

1800
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:23,280
earlier

1801
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,800
and so this means that between the two

1802
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,480
links the link which is mostly kept is

1803
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,480
going to have sort of less congestion

1804
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,960
and higher throughput

1805
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,600
but within each link within the a b test

1806
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,199
the child effect won't see any

1807
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:36,719
difference

1808
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:37,920
yeah and so there's no difference in

1809
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,280
throughput between the links but there

1810
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,800
is across the links and this is why the

1811
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,239
a b tests are now giving us accurate

1812
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,718
estimates

1813
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,800
so that was for throughput we also saw

1814
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,640
this behavior for a couple other metrics

1815
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,320
that we were interested in one was round

1816
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,920
trip time and the other one was play

1817
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,600
delay or sort of how long it takes for

1818
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,520
the video to start up

1819
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,960
in all of these cases we saw

1820
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,159
improvements in the total treatment

1821
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,000
effect like capping improved these

1822
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,560
metrics but the a b tests sort of didn't

1823
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,080
even get the direction of improvement

1824
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,000
wrong they either reported that the

1825
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,520
metric would get worse or that the

1826
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,800
metric was not affected by the treatment

1827
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,719
and the the a b test was like extremely

1828
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,080
confident about this like you know you

1829
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,000
compute the 95 confidence intervals

1830
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,440
they're very confident that it's five to

1831
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,440
fifteen percent worse in an a b test

1832
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,040
when really it's 25 percent better

1833
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,679
so what this experiment shows is that a

1834
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,120
b tests are biased when they're running

1835
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,640
congested networks

1836
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,320
and this to us was pretty concerning

1837
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,320
because we use av tests really heavily

1838
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,400
to evaluate new algorithms

1839
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,920
and if they're

1840
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,239
not giving us even the right direction

1841
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:45,679
in some cases

1842
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,679
uh we're worried about this decisions we

1843
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:51,840
might make as a result of these tests

1844
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,640
so let me be a little bit more specific

1845
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,400
about these risks here

1846
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,080
here's a pretty common development

1847
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,239
process you might use if you're using ap

1848
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:01,199
tests

1849
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:02,800
it's pretty similar to the process that

1850
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,239
the team we work with pretty closely at

1851
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:05,920
netflix is using

1852
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,440
so maybe you'll come up with some idea

1853
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,600
you'll implement that idea you'll run an

1854
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,280
a b test for that idea and you'll get a

1855
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,600
sense of how the idea performs and then

1856
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,880
you'll iterate these steps one through

1857
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,920
three until you'll come up with

1858
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,120
something that works pretty well and

1859
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,400
then you'll go and you'll deploy that

1860
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,719
idea

1861
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,719
so the risks here is that when you run

1862
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,400
an a b test you don't get an accurate

1863
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,920
estimate of what happens when you deploy

1864
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,960
the idea

1865
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,639
and this can have a couple of different

1866
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,239
consequences

1867
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,920
within the development process it means

1868
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,840
you could give up too early on an idea

1869
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,280
that's good that would work well in

1870
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,960
production just because you don't see it

1871
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,199
work as well in the a b test

1872
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,639
or you could continue on with an

1873
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,320
approach that doesn't work like when you

1874
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,320
go and you deploy it but seems to work

1875
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,719
well in the a b test

1876
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,800
when you finally deploy the thing

1877
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,679
um

1878
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:50,960
you could deploy something that doesn't

1879
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,639
work as expected and in the worst case

1880
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,239
this could cause a production impacting

1881
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,480
issue or in probably a more typical case

1882
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,520
you might just have to go through this

1883
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,360
process many more times

1884
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,559
and improve the algorithm

1885
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,480
so so those are the risks but another

1886
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,840
thing we saw is that we can run

1887
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,520
experiments that help reduce and remove

1888
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,800
this bias

1889
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,639
so this perdlink experiment we described

1890
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:14,639
is just one example and there are other

1891
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,080
sorts of experiments you can use that

1892
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,080
are also less impacted by bias so i'd

1893
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,199
like to tell you about two of these

1894
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,678
experiments

1895
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,360
the first kind of experiment design is

1896
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,040
called an event study

1897
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,199
in an event study you have some event

1898
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:28,639
and then you compare what happens after

1899
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,080
the event to what happens before the

1900
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:30,960
event

1901
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,360
so in this case on the right we can look

1902
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,360
at bit rate capping the event here is

1903
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,400
going to be sort of switching to 95 bit

1904
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,840
rate capping

1905
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,920
and we're going to do that say right

1906
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,440
here on friday

1907
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,880
so what we would do we would switch on

1908
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,199
friday to 95 capping and then we would

1909
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,840
compare after and before

1910
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,280
this would give us an estimate of the

1911
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,880
total treatment effect

1912
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,199
and if we switch from say five percent

1913
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,760
capping to 95 capping we can also

1914
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,440
compare this to the results of the av

1915
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,880
test and get a sense of whether or not

1916
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,760
the a b test was biased

1917
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,199
another good thing about this sort of

1918
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,280
experiment design is it's

1919
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,880
pretty common folks might already be

1920
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,040
doing this when they deploy things so if

1921
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,639
you go and you deploy a new feature it's

1922
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,480
pretty common to look at the metrics

1923
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,400
before and after the deployment and see

1924
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,320
how it the deployment impacted those

1925
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,080
metrics

1926
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,760
when you do this you can compare those

1927
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,440
metrics to the a b test and you can

1928
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,199
start to build up some intuition about

1929
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:26,960
whether particular changes are impacted

1930
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,239
by congestion interference

1931
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,480
the big problem with event studies is an

1932
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,480
issue called seasonality and this is

1933
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,400
basically so you look after some event

1934
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,400
and compare it to before that event

1935
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,840
but there might be other events that

1936
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,440
happen around the same time and you're

1937
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,960
not going to be able to rule out things

1938
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,120
that were caused by that event

1939
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,800
so in this particular experiment

1940
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:51,679
one event here is that we're switching

1941
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,440
to captain and another event is that

1942
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,040
it's suddenly the weekend

1943
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,320
and so we're not going to be able to

1944
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,920
disentangle here the difference between

1945
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,440
things that are caused by the weekend

1946
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,799
and things that are caused by capping

1947
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,480
one way we can deal with this is with a

1948
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,400
switchback experiment this is another

1949
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,320
sort of experiment design where instead

1950
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,040
of just switching once we switch back

1951
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,120
and forth between treatment and control

1952
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,120
so maybe on this day we use capping on

1953
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,040
the second day we use

1954
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,560
no capping and then we switch back and

1955
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,880
forth

1956
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,400
we compare all the days where we're

1957
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,679
capping to all the days where we're not

1958
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,199
capping and we use this to estimate the

1959
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:29,840
total treatment effect

1960
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,679
so again this gives us an estimate of

1961
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:33,360
the total treatment effect

1962
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,040
and this is going to be more robust to

1963
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,880
seasonality issues because sort of in

1964
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,800
order to get the bias here from other

1965
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,800
events those events need to line up with

1966
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,400
most of the switches throughout the

1967
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,600
experiment

1968
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,520
and especially if you randomize the days

1969
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,120
on which you are using treatment or

1970
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,880
using control this can help avoid these

1971
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,199
issues

1972
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:56,400
the major con here is a carryover effect

1973
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,639
and this is when sort of the fact that

1974
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,880
i'm doing capping towards the end of

1975
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,080
thursday is going to change the initial

1976
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,280
conditions that you see on friday

1977
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,400
and then

1978
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,880
maybe the whole path of the friday

1979
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,320
say throughput in this case is going to

1980
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,360
be different than you would see with

1981
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,600
control

1982
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,120
so this is um

1983
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,400
this is certainly a risk but it's sort

1984
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,159
of a risk that depends on your system

1985
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:21,440
and if you're running experiments i

1986
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,040
think you may be pretty familiar with

1987
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,520
like the carryover the sort of behavior

1988
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,440
the way your system changes over time

1989
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,880
and you can design this experiment

1990
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,840
accordingly

1991
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,679
so those are just two sort of experiment

1992
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,080
designs you can use to avoid some of the

1993
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:40,320
impacts of congestion interference

1994
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,320
and so i'd like to conclude and say

1995
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,960
there's a lot more that we can do here

1996
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,800
so i think what our work showed is that

1997
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,639
if you have an a b test and this a b

1998
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:51,040
test uses a congested network this a b

1999
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,600
test has the possibility of being biased

2000
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,520
there's this pathway for treatment and

2001
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,920
control to interfere with each other via

2002
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,360
the use of their shared links

2003
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,159
what we don't know is sort of how much

2004
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:07,120
this bias matters

2005
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:09,440
we don't know if the bias is going to be

2006
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,199
a small fraction or a large fraction

2007
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:12,639
especially in experiments that you might

2008
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,480
be running like we know what it is for

2009
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,080
this one particular experiment but we

2010
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,199
don't know what it is for all

2011
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,040
experiments and so we would encourage

2012
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,800
you to go and run some measurements if

2013
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,719
you are running experiments to see if

2014
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:24,239
this kind of interference matters for

2015
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,639
your experiments

2016
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,000
and i think personally one thing i would

2017
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,239
really love to see is

2018
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:32,800
new papers and new proposals

2019
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,239
talking about total treatment effects

2020
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:36,320
and sort of reporting the results for

2021
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,600
instance when they go and they deploy

2022
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,280
the algorithm

2023
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,639
instead of just the results of a small

2024
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:43,520
scale a b test

2025
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,040
i think mainly what this work highlights

2026
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,239
is that we have a need for better

2027
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,880
experiment methodology for networks

2028
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,120
so

2029
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
our the experiments we've proposed are

2030
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,639
just a couple of different ways that you

2031
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:58,480
could hope to run experiments to measure

2032
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,320
the total treatment effects

2033
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,840
and to be honest their experiments we

2034
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,520
took pretty much

2035
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,760
um without much modification

2036
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,520
from causal inference work and other

2037
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,520
experiment literature

2038
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,960
i personally think that if we were to

2039
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,560
sit down and design experiments for

2040
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,719
networking algorithms using what we know

2041
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,159
about networks we could probably come up

2042
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,320
with more sophisticated experiments that

2043
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,080
could give us better results and like

2044
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,760
more confidence and better estimates of

2045
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,080
the total treatment effects

2046
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,440
and personally i'm really excited to see

2047
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,360
the kind of algorithms we could build

2048
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:28,560
the kind of results we could get by

2049
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,159
using these experiments

2050
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:33,320
so thanks

2051
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,560
okay uh thank you bruce

2052
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,280
excellent talk

2053
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,199
um does anyone have any questions

2054
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:50,599
uh jenna

2055
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,480
i think i'm

2056
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,760
in okay

2057
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,679
um

2058
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:01,840
thank you bruce that was a great talk

2059
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,560
and good work and hi by the way it's uh

2060
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,760
good to see you

2061
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,880
presenting uh at the irtf

2062
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,000
i will say that uh

2063
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,960
this is very very eliminating um

2064
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,159
at a minimum

2065
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:18,239
i think it's it's something that uh as

2066
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:19,840
you say everybody should take into

2067
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,080
account when doing these experiments

2068
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,040
and it's uh great to have

2069
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,000
the data to back it up and to argue that

2070
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,159
uh simple small a b tests which i've

2071
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,719
relied on for a long time aren't

2072
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:34,400
necessarily good enough

2073
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,159
but i was going to poke a little bit

2074
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,600
more at the thing that you just said

2075
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,360
which is the

2076
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,560
um

2077
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,130
the the

2078
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:42,719
[Music]

2079
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:47,840
dominance of the bias that you see there

2080
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,520
in particular one thing that occurs to

2081
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,480
me is

2082
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,080
uh i don't know if you've looked into

2083
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,400
seeing if you made like for example a

2084
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,800
client sticky

2085
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,560
for a particular

2086
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,760
a b test

2087
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,679
as against i don't know how exactly i

2088
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,760
haven't read the paper in detail but how

2089
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,679
exactly the uh

2090
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:07,920
choice was made for serving particular

2091
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,280
type of content but i imagine that

2092
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,880
i guess where i'm coming from is that it

2093
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,320
depends on whether bottleneck really

2094
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,199
lies

2095
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:17,120
if the bottleneck is a shed the bottling

2096
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,320
has to be a shared bottle like in this

2097
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,560
particular case for the the control and

2098
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,639
the experiment groups

2099
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:24,719
and if as is commonly the case the

2100
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:26,639
bottleneck is closer to the

2101
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,960
user and not like it repair peering link

2102
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,960
or some other place

2103
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,639
then in that particular case i imagine

2104
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,280
that if the user is in a bucket that is

2105
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,960
either control

2106
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,800
or

2107
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,840
treatment

2108
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,120
then

2109
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,679
the user would basically effectively be

2110
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,159
at the far end of your of your scale

2111
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:47,040
right like

2112
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,800
for you by seeing that effect

2113
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,600
um

2114
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,280
have you looked into that have you were

2115
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,159
your experiments sticky to users

2116
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:56,159
yeah so this is a good point that um

2117
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:57,199
there are things you can do on the

2118
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,199
allocation side to kind of avoid some of

2119
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,360
these issues so the experiments we ran

2120
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,600
were sticky to users um

2121
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,280
although it's a little bit tricky

2122
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,040
because it's like the users that are

2123
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,840
going over these two different

2124
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,719
paths um

2125
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:12,560
but the the sort of overall point you're

2126
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:16,719
making is is true that like if you um

2127
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:19,360
sort of can guarantee that the users are

2128
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,960
not going to share any resources with

2129
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,719
each other over the whole way then

2130
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:24,080
you're going to be able to avoid this

2131
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,360
bias

2132
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,040
because there's no pathway for them to

2133
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,639
interfere with each other

2134
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:30,080
and if you sort of believe that all of

2135
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,920
the users are not sharing any of their

2136
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,679
bottleneck links with each other then

2137
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:34,960
you've sort of avoided some of the

2138
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,360
possibility for bias

2139
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,960
we didn't explore this too much because

2140
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,239
we found it pretty hard to measure

2141
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:43,040
whether or not users were sharing

2142
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,480
links and we didn't have a good sense of

2143
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,199
like how often this was

2144
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:48,480
um

2145
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,480
but i guess okay so if you were to

2146
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,880
allocate users instead of sessions my

2147
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,560
gut instinct would be that this is an

2148
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,080
improvement over just allocating

2149
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,400
sessions in terms of interference

2150
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,760
another thing you could do is you could

2151
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,760
allocate networks

2152
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,199
or

2153
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:05,120
particular servers or

2154
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,800
sort of try and reduce the probability

2155
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,000
that there is sort of treatment and

2156
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,480
control sharing the same length

2157
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,760
and if you do this i think this will

2158
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,360
reduce the bias that you would see in

2159
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,920
the experiment

2160
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:18,320
yeah that's very helpful um

2161
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,600
i was asking this because if you

2162
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,360
actually did the experiment

2163
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,400
by trying to if we tried to

2164
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,760
uh

2165
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,199
it could tell you something about where

2166
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:29,679
users end up sharing bottlenecks as well

2167
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,360
if you actually tried to do it the way

2168
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,719
that you were servicing any of these

2169
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,639
ways

2170
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:36,639
those ought to make things better when

2171
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,480
the bottleneck is closer to the user

2172
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,400
versus not

2173
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,199
and those experiments can actually shed

2174
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:46,080
some pretty interesting light on exactly

2175
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,840
where bottlenecks

2176
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,120
on the internet

2177
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,920
yeah absolutely

2178
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,639
thank you again

2179
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:59,520
uh thank you jenna uh brian you have a

2180
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,639
question

2181
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:04,000
is this microphone on can we hear me

2182
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,440
that microphone is not on let me go to

2183
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,678
the other

2184
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,719
hi brian trammell not speaking as um

2185
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,560
sort of i guess a

2186
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,560
solar flare backup chair

2187
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,000
um

2188
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,840
so there was something that you said

2189
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,239
earlier that that was i think kind of

2190
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:27,840
fundamental and really interesting that

2191
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,679
i want to repeat back if we use what we

2192
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:30,719
know

2193
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,560
about networks to design experiments

2194
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,080
about networks we can get you know we

2195
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,000
can get a lot smarter about this

2196
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,440
and then i was looking at the graph that

2197
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,840
you had of the switchback experiment and

2198
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,159
what it ex what that

2199
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:43,600
reminded me of more than nothing else

2200
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,280
was like a diagram of time division

2201
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,199
multiple access from sort of like a

2202
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:49,199
physical layer textbook that i looked at

2203
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:50,639
in college right

2204
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:53,840
so a b tests are basically code division

2205
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,080
partition of the space

2206
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,239
switchbacks or time division partition

2207
01:31:58,239 --> 01:31:59,840
of the space

2208
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,199
like all of the stuff that john was

2209
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:02,960
talking about were other sort of ways to

2210
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,719
split the space with different sorts of

2211
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,480
ways to code it

2212
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,159
are there other

2213
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:09,600
bits like

2214
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,800
ways to use this multiple access

2215
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,800
metaphor to find other ways to split the

2216
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:17,280
space in order to figure out

2217
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,000
like

2218
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,600
how to split this apart because like my

2219
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,760
sre mind basically wants to say well we

2220
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,040
could basically automate this code

2221
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,239
partition in a whole bunch of different

2222
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:26,000
ways and then you know watch which

2223
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,360
things show up in the power spectrum

2224
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,040
which things get amplified out of that

2225
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,560
but i'm wondering if there's a more

2226
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,000
fundamental way that you could split

2227
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,560
this up in order to be able to

2228
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,080
i'm not expecting an answer to that

2229
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,639
question right now um but

2230
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:40,480
um if you have one it'd be great

2231
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,840
but yeah

2232
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,320
it's a super interesting question

2233
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,560
i don't have a an answer up him but it's

2234
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,080
yeah it's really interesting to think i

2235
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,440
would be interested in following up with

2236
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,639
you on an answer to that question

2237
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:51,760
because i think there's something like

2238
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,440
really kind of deep there

2239
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,120
yeah i'm happy to chat about it

2240
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,159
definitely

2241
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,639
um i can share a little bit about other

2242
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:00,000
experiments that people run and maybe

2243
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,520
this will be interesting

2244
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,440
um so one thing people do in social

2245
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,520
networks that i think is pretty cool

2246
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,360
is you would um

2247
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,360
sort of allocate a user and then all of

2248
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,199
a friends users to a particular

2249
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:12,800
treatment and you sort of think about

2250
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,159
this graph structure and how you can

2251
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:15,760
allocate based on this graph structure

2252
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,239
in order to get optimal behavior

2253
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:19,520
and so maybe there's something cool we

2254
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,320
could do with that for networks

2255
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:27,840
yep

2256
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,480
uh try

2257
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,080
yes this is jonathan morton

2258
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,080
and um

2259
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,080
i think the one of the big lessons to

2260
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,719
take away from this is how important it

2261
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:41,600
is

2262
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,480
to

2263
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:45,440
understand the

2264
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:50,400
uh the testing methodology in detail

2265
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,400
when we look at a set of um of

2266
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,679
purported

2267
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,159
results particularly ones that are used

2268
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,879
for marketing

2269
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,320
so

2270
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,040
the

2271
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,679
fine details of the testing methodology

2272
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:08,560
can have a big effect such as exactly

2273
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,960
how this a b test

2274
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,880
may have been done

2275
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,800
and whether the uh

2276
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,480
the potential bias that you've just

2277
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,960
highlighted

2278
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,480
has been mitigated in any way

2279
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,239
yeah definitely

2280
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,920
okay uh apparently there may be problems

2281
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,840
in the room but hopefully you can still

2282
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,040
hear us if not see

2283
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,119
good good

2284
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,719
okay um

2285
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:54,960
so i guess um

2286
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,280
i guess uh i i asked the same sort of

2287
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,119
question i used to send guitar earlier

2288
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:00,880
which is uh you know obviously you're

2289
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,280
talking to the the ie etf

2290
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:06,480
and and the irtf um and you said there

2291
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,199
was a need for for better experiment

2292
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,520
methodology

2293
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,520
um

2294
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,440
what it what if anything should we be

2295
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:18,400
doing

2296
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,199
um

2297
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,760
when when we're designing protocols

2298
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,600
evaluating protocols

2299
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,280
to to

2300
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,880
to make sure the evaluations and the

2301
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,360
critical designs are right

2302
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,400
is there some sort of general guidance

2303
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,560
that we should be providing or is it

2304
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,000
read this paper and think about these

2305
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,840
issues

2306
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,440
i guess uh

2307
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,800
overall what i would say is

2308
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,239
i think all the stuff we're doing today

2309
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,080
is good and we know it's good because we

2310
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,320
like we build good systems with the the

2311
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,320
stuff we do today and i think what this

2312
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,080
gives us is like another tool to think

2313
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,239
about how the algorithms work and try to

2314
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:56,000
measure like the way these algorithms

2315
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,040
work

2316
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,600
and so i guess kind of when designing

2317
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,600
new algorithms like in the itf i would

2318
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,199
think about like

2319
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,520
um the way the experiments we run to

2320
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,199
validate those algorithms can be biased

2321
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:08,400
and then i would try to think about

2322
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,840
other ways of running experiments that

2323
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,800
might reduce that bias

2324
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:21,280
yep okay that makes sense make sense

2325
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,320
all right that's it any other questions

2326
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,520
for

2327
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,679
the speaker

2328
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:42,159
okay uh i guess not so in that case

2329
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:43,520
thank you

2330
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,050
uh bruce

2331
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:50,480
[Applause]

2332
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,040
and again thank you to to both of you

2333
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,600
and and congratulations on on the awards

2334
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,800
um i

2335
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:57,920
i

2336
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,320
do wish uh

2337
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,560
we could present these in person but uh

2338
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,920
i'm sure we'll

2339
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:04,639
uh

2340
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:06,960
find ways of of getting the awards to

2341
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,159
you

2342
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,760
um

2343
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,520
