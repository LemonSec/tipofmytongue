00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,879
don't know

17
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,920

21
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
it's not too i was going here

22
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,439
so

23
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,159
sorry did you simply share

24
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,840
the application

25
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,879
okay stop sharing

26
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
and then

27
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,360
then go to presentation view

28
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
and you should

29
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,360
now

30
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,959
get back to

31
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,200
the technology

32
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,440
yes

33
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,639
open

34
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
okay folks

35
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,520
sorry for the delay

36
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
thank you very much for coming to the

37
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,639
host tech talk this is cheapen xiao from

38
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,160
huawei

39
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
um

40
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,360
there are a million ipv6 talks right so

41
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,520
i first want to answer the question why

42
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,560
you should also listen to this one

43
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,840
the reason is that

44
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,960
that

45
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,440
i think that most ipv6 talks are given

46
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,759
by ipv6 supporters

47
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,240
and usually the ipv6 supporters only

48
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,039
tell you the good thing about ipv6

49
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,639
and i think that what's unique in

50
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,560
today's presentation

51
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,880
is that we are going to talk about a lot

52
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,639
of the challenges

53
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,560
facing ipv6

54
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,360
and the reason why i feel that this is

55
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
important and useful

56
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,360
is that

57
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,440
just like you know nobody is perfect no

58
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,759
technology is perfect you know every

59
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,319
technology have certain problems

60
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,800
and in order to get all the people on

61
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,680
board

62
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
to deploy ipv6 we really need to

63
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,280
acknowledge the challenges certain

64
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,720
challenges facing ipv6 document the

65
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,840
challenges

66
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,160
um possibly provide a guideline

67
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
and i think that uh eric winker kind of

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
like set a good example for us in rfc

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,560
1999

70
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,360
because i've seen 1999 basically

71
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
document all the ipv6 security excels um

72
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,080
provide guidelines this way you know

73
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
people

74
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,680
feel more confident that oh you know

75
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,240
ietf no other excuse and you know they

76
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
are solving this is actually you know

77
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
provide more confidence not less

78
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,880
confidence

79
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
so with that

80
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,980
um

81
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,240
[Music]

82
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
i really want to say that we spent a lot

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,639
of time presenting uh preparing for

84
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,680
these

85
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
uh presentations and a lot of people

86
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,759
provided a lot of uh

87
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,000
you know either statistics or provide a

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,880
local review and the list is long and

89
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,440
here i really again want to thank eric

90
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
binker because he provided a lot of you

91
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,840
know very detailed feedbacks

92
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
so

93
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,720
the first part is the momentum

94
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,680
while this is both for the ipv6

95
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,800
supporters and the ipv6 deniers by ipv69

96
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,960
i really have no fixed respect you know

97
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,440
just easier name to refer to the camp

98
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,560
i know that the ipv6

99
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,000
for example in the nano uh

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,919
in the nano mailing leaks there was a

101
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,840
big debate this month

102
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
about ipv6 and

103
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
some people are complaining that our

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,520
ipv6 is not easy to deploy there's no

105
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,639
end user demand etc

106
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,479
while we acknowledge that later here we

107
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,399
want to say that you know for many of

108
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,200
these

109
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,919
are you aware of the ipv6 progress

110
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,559
in recent years because 10 years ago if

111
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,958
you are consuming ipv6 you are more or

112
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,800
less justified because at that time

113
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,839
there's almost zero ipv6 users

114
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,360
but now

115
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,279
according to this google stats we

116
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,040
already have 36 percent ipv6 user

117
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,680
um some people argue that actually

118
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,160
due to the way google count the users

119
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,040
many ipv6 users in china are actually

120
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,920
mixed

121
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,399
so if you count e also the users in

122
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,680
china it could be as high as 45 percent

123
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,800
based on the etsi study

124
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,680
but

125
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,399
while ipv6 go very fast

126
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,640
the

127
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
the

128
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,720
it's very uneven and this will have a

129
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
major implication later that we will

130
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,240
talk about so what's driving these ipv6

131
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,440
momentums

132
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,519
according to jeff houston this is you

133
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,720
know the gdp per capita you know which

134
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,880
country usually are more enthusiastic in

135
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,519
doing ipv6 the user grows like a

136
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,800
reliance on ipv for salties

137
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,120
and also the competition

138
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,360
but it's not just this it's not just

139
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,000
this and here we'd like to offer our

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
perspective

141
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,880
other you know strong momentum on ipv6

142
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
the first one is that we believe that

143
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,920
the

144
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,519
loyaltineness

145
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,640
of

146
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,600
ipv6 value chain is something very

147
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,640
important

148
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,160
because the ues the network and the

149
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,279
application train is finally

150
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,399
ready

151
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,720
because 10 years ago if you know some of

152
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,959
these the content are not already they

153
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,360
even if operator deployed ipv6 you are

154
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,839
not going to get much benefit but now

155
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,360
it's very different

156
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
and here we list some of the major

157
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,000
milestones but the slide is busy so you

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,079
don't need to read that all i want you

159
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,200
to know is that it's summarized in these

160
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,279
two blue bars

161
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,040
by 2011 ietf largely get the

162
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,440
solution already

163
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,760
by 2017

164
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,279
the ues the ues and the big application

165
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,120
like you know google netflix are already

166
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,519
and this year we believe that there is

167
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,480
another important milestone

168
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,200
that many people may not realize yet

169
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,560
is the public cloud support of ipv6 like

170
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,839
as

171
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,240
aws these are important we will talk

172
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,959
about why you know this is this may be

173
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,839
quite

174
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,160
significant and then on the value trend

175
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,360
uh we are seeing that the network

176
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,279
is still slightly behind the ue um

177
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,399
the

178
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,680
content

179
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,440
and if you are interested i will not go

180
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,600
into detail if you are interested even

181
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,200
later we can discuss why you know the

182
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,760
network is 42 percent how we computing

183
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,160
that etc

184
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,279
um another point is that

185
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,000
i don't know whether ipv6 the denial

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,959
realized that the price of ipv4 is going

187
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,320
up so quickly

188
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,880
and specifically the price doubled last

189
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,839
year

190
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,120
and if you call it long 2014

191
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
it already increased seven times so if

192
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,519
you the world on ipv4 you may have to

193
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,279
spend a lot more money if you have to

194
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,560
buy ip

195
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
default address or for some operator

196
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,000
they are even considering you know going

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,120
to ipv6 quickly and while ipv4 you know

198
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,279
price is very high they can sell their

199
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,279
ipv4 address this is important one

200
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,160
and then the public ipv6 weight this is

201
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,639
the kind of the other momentum that we

202
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,040
saw

203
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,560
one is this

204
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,720
just now we mentioned that

205
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,279
aws ages support

206
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,160
of ipv6 why we believe that this is uh

207
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
maybe very important

208
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,040
we when we look at the operators you

209
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,680
know the big operating six terms the

210
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,920
small and medium enterprise

211
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,040
we find that small and medium enterprise

212
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,600
have the least motivation

213
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,839
to move to

214
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
ipv6 because they they have a very you

215
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,920
know they don't need mainly address

216
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,760
and also they may not have the technical

217
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,480
expertise to make the move

218
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,040
so usually you know we if we look at the

219
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,120
sme you know there's a huge number of

220
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,560
smes they are simply in in ipv4 but we

221
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,079
believe that when these you know aws as

222
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,880
when they support ipv6 and as the you

223
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,360
know sme go to the cloud you know uh aws

224
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,160
may enable them to move to ipv6 very

225
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,279
quickly

226
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,200
in the past they may have to do a lot of

227
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,839
work themselves but now they simply

228
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,959
select ipv4 or ipv6 and if they select

229
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,040
ipv6 they go ipv6 so we may

230
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,279
know today in the v6

231
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,839
working group there's a discussion

232
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,079
you know how to move the sme and we

233
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,839
believe that this may be

234
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,199
a very big momentum and then on the iot

235
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,199
you'll probably see the number already

236
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,680
there's a lot of iot device

237
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
and then 5g

238
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,959
bring new bl and new opportunity and

239
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,600
then obviously there's these innovations

240
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,680
on top of ip

241
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,600
v6 srv6 and other things provide better

242
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,839
traffic engineering network programming

243
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,279
etc

244
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,160
so

245
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,279
for the people who don't believe in ipv6

246
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,160
i think

247
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,560
we really want to

248
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,880
these are some of the recent progress

249
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,040
not to mention the for example the big

250
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,120
government proves you know us government

251
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,680
is pushing towards ipv6

252
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
chinese government is focusing but i

253
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,079
guess maybe ietf people don't want

254
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,320
government regulations so i avoid them

255
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,639
here

256
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,480
and the second part i think that the

257
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,920
first part is more to the ipv69

258
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,800
and the second part is more to the ipv6

259
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
supporters

260
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,199
um here what we want to say is that for

261
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,560
the ipv6 supporters

262
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,440
there

263
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,760
there really are more challenges than

264
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,399
you think because you know we as the the

265
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
supporters sometimes we feel that oh you

266
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,839
know

267
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
our work ietf work is done you know

268
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,279
these people are not doing ipv6 just

269
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,040
because of the lack of the

270
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,680
motivation or because they are they are

271
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,320
saying all kinds of skills you know i am

272
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,880
completely ready and what i want to say

273
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,360
here is that yeah we are we are quite

274
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,560
ready but not completely and let's see

275
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,120
so first this is a

276
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,880
survey from every nic it's done in 2017

277
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,279
you can say that oh 2017 may be too old

278
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,600
but actually you know based on what i

279
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,240
hear from other industry forum if i

280
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,160
compare it to some of the ipv6

281
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,680
challenges in

282
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,399
in december last year

283
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,279
eating the chinese deck marks and really

284
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,560
uh

285
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,800
here i think that it may be difficult

286
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,199
for you to to see

287
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,240
uh other thing but i just want to kind

288
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,880
of like quickly classify them

289
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,920
into four categories one is motivation i

290
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,720
think that for ipv6 this like motivation

291
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,680
is always one of the biggest uh xu

292
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,920
okay you know my end user don't care

293
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,880
about ipv6 it's a lot of work so you

294
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,839
know why supply so things like this and

295
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,320
ignore this is also a big part you know

296
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,560
okay you know i don't understand ipv6

297
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,199
there are so many new protocols

298
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,759
it's difficult so i think the big part

299
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,160
uh ecosystem is the value trend that we

300
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,639
talked about that ue is you know it's my

301
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,079
that's my cpu support ipv6 and the

302
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,639
network the routers etc

303
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,880
and then technology is what's closely

304
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,600
related to ietf that we will focus on

305
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,680
today

306
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,360
so regarding this motivation knowledge i

307
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,639
think that you know these uh slides look

308
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,839
a little

309
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,880
deeper

310
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
i think that maybe

311
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,000
we focus on the the more uh technical

312
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,040
part

313
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,079
is the technology is the technology so

314
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,160
that the legacy device

315
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,120
is the ipv6 the network management

316
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,319
system i think generally this is a field

317
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,359
that you know ipv6 network management

318
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,359
compared to ipv4

319
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,439
i think that you know there's still

320
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,559
some work to do and the oam also may be

321
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,599
not as mature these are the some of the

322
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,439
you know common complaints from the

323
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,559
field

324
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,640
but we want to say that yes

325
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,959
these are issues but you know

326
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,280
the industry largely you know taking uh

327
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,559
action to

328
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,640
to deal with them so regarding the

329
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,720
motivation and knowledge you know

330
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
leading operators are sharing that

331
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
experience and then you know there's

332
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,440
many ipv6 forums councils

333
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,320
i think as far as i know the uk ipv6

334
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,640
console is is

335
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
especially you know active and they're

336
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,559
doing a lot of good work

337
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,400
and then for the

338
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
ecosystem i think it will so clearly

339
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,799
thank you know

340
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,559
google amazon

341
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,480
i think microsoft

342
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,520
they really did a lot of work at all

343
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,919
they really did a lot of work to move

344
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,160
the industry towards

345
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,440
ipv6 and for the last part for the last

346
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
part we are going to talk about the

347
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,960
technical challenge i think that it's

348
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,880
the focus of our

349
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,919
presentation today

350
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,960
so

351
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
before we talk about the bad things

352
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,880
first let's uh

353
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,720
let's say that you know ietf has done a

354
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,679
lot so you know this is not to to

355
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,760
complain this is not to to complain but

356
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,679
even though that we have done a lot i

357
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,000
think there are remaining challenges

358
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
remaining challenges

359
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,039
um

360
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,880
so the first one i think that you know

361
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
to compare the ipv6 performance versus

362
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,880
ipv4

363
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,160
uh may be very relevant and more telling

364
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,880
because between ipv6 and ipv4 there are

365
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
so many things that you can compare

366
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,960
there's so many things that you can

367
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,520
compare for example neighbor discovery

368
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,000
is very different from app but we

369
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,760
believe that you know performance is

370
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,840
really the

371
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,760
important or maybe the most important

372
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,120
you know uh

373
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,480
kpi

374
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,280
so

375
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,200
the first one is regarding the round

376
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,960
chip time

377
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
the latency

378
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,440
so as you can see okay you can see here

379
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
over the years the

380
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,960
the

381
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,840
uh

382
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,559
ipv6 road trip time

383
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,960
is you know constantly improving it's

384
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,799
constantly improving

385
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,360
but today it's the old you know 2.5

386
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,240
milliseconds higher than ipv4

387
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,039
then ipv4 but this is what average this

388
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,799
is whatever right you know later i will

389
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,039
provide you know kind of like the

390
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,919
the the going of thought on my own you

391
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:50,799
know

392
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,200
this data and again this is based on

393
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,880
jeff houston's status in ap nix

394
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
there are you know in the industry there

395
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,799
are some other statistics

396
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,280
like linked all have some statics rather

397
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,039
than cc have statics etc that way or at

398
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,120
least i personally believe that maybe ap

399
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,480
nick's data is more systematic so we are

400
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,720
so i think that uh first is that you

401
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,400
know ipv6 and ipv4 is very very close

402
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,880
but it's slightly higher on a worldwide

403
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,440
average scale

404
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,320
so

405
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,799
uh i think the very good question to us

406
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,120
here is that what are the top three

407
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,679
factors leading to this improvement why

408
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,360
you know over the years why this is

409
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,400
improving

410
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,720
and if we understand what are

411
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,360
contributing to this improvement then i

412
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,799
think that you know we can provide a

413
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,799
guideline for other operators that oh

414
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,039
you know do this from day one

415
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,200
then you know you can you can you know

416
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,679
avoid certain things

417
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,200
so this is the

418
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,640
logic time

419
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,600
the second one is the packet loss

420
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,559
rate

421
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,520
and we find that the data here is really

422
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
inconclusive

423
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,200
we provide you know two data points here

424
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,880
the first one is from these hindavi um

425
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,039
it reported ipv6 plr actually

426
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,840
lower than

427
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,760
ipv4 and this is they they did the

428
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,520
management based on one way of

429
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
management from

430
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,520
uh from china

431
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,919
and it says that you know for them they

432
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,760
find out that ipv4 packet loss rate is

433
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
0.25 percent

434
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,360
um for ipv4 is 0.33

435
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,080
so ipv6 performs slightly better they

436
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,120
also have some you know distribution

437
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,559
so in the asia is is much better it's

438
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,559
all clearly better

439
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,919
ipv6 than ipv4 and for other regions

440
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,080
they are more or less seeming more or

441
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,360
less similar

442
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
and then we also

443
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,000
get one data point on one angle and then

444
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,240
on the right hand side

445
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,159
we are seeing kind of like a different

446
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,200
result

447
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,760
so here we are citing you know rfc 7872

448
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,480
by i think by fernando by zhang lincoln

449
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,320
here and now i think recently uh

450
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,799
eric winker also have the so-called jeff

451
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,360
james uh talking about some new

452
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,960
management on

453
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,320
on these

454
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,159
extension headers

455
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,280
but

456
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,480
the the

457
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,120
long story short the result is that you

458
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,280
know in 2017

459
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,240
the package loss rate for for the taxi

460
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,640
which fragmentation is seemingly high 21

461
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,799
percent and even last year it's still

462
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,880
eight percent it improves a lot but it's

463
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,559
still very high

464
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,720
um

465
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,000
because we heard from many operators

466
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,559
we heard from many operators like their

467
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,640
ipv for

468
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,559
packing loss rate or their packet loss

469
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,440
rate

470
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,159
is about 0.1 percent and we take it as

471
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,720
ipv4 because mainly most traffic is

472
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
still ipv4

473
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,720
um but you know that's really i think

474
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,480
that we find in the industry but there

475
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,159
is no data on ipv6 packet glossary or at

476
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,640
least ap don't provide it we will

477
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,520
find but we didn't find it so if anybody

478
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,600
have this data we would love to hear

479
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
from you

480
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,919
so if we take it from the the first

481
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,720
study ex02.5

482
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,919
then ipv6 is higher than iphone but

483
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,480
again this is inconclusive

484
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,320
um we

485
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,799
we we don't know uh

486
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,760
how much of this overall

487
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,600
packet loss rate is coming from those

488
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,760
fragmentation extinction headers etc we

489
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,840
believe that this would be uh you know

490
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,640
something good to to find out

491
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,919
um

492
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,880
we we

493
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,120
we really feel that you know if we can

494
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,360
dig into this and find out why you know

495
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,880
ipv6 is losing package etc again this

496
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,080
will help

497
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,360
will help

498
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,240
to to improve the performance and make

499
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,120
the the life of those deployer

500
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,799
a little easier

501
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,240
and the third one is the tcp 3d rig

502
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,799
again we can see that the the blue the

503
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,440
green one is ipv6 and then the other is

504
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,679
v4 we can see that

505
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,440
over time

506
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,640
the

507
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,679
ipv6 tcp failure rate is like again

508
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,679
constantly improving

509
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,600
but a database on the data uh today

510
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,159
ap nick it's still you know 0.96 percent

511
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,559
and ipv4 you know depending on how you

512
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,320
look it may be like

513
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,720
0.25 percent or

514
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
some people jeff houston said oh it's

515
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,440
almost like zero percent so you know

516
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,279
ipv4 is almost

517
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,600
successful but anyhow i think that the

518
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,440
conclusion is the same

519
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,039
tcp failure

520
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,159
ipv6 is higher

521
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,279
so the question is that is it because of

522
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,440
the higher packing loss rate

523
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
of ipv6 i think that this will certainly

524
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,440
you know if you have a higher ipv6

525
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,559
plr it's quite likely that the tcp

526
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,120
failure rate will also be higher

527
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,320
and then

528
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,520
because quick is using more and more

529
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,240
in addition to view to measuring tcp

530
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,799
failure rates we also be measuring quick

531
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,279
as well so i think that these are some

532
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,760
of the good questions

533
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,880
um

534
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
okay you know me as a supporter ipv6

535
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,600
supporter talking about ipv6 challenges

536
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,159
here and some people say that oh they

537
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,480
they may be concerned that okay you know

538
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,240
i come to the conclusion that we

539
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,200
shouldn't do ipv6 and i want to tell you

540
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,080
that this is not the case because again

541
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,720
that just now what we're presenting is

542
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,440
the worldwide average

543
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,080
world wherever it can

544
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,799
you know the average can hide a lot of

545
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,520
things can hide a lot of things and if

546
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,679
we look at the data you know more

547
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,720
carefully

548
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,400
we will see that you know the wall

549
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,880
average can be jerked out by a region

550
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,760
badly and again this is the same stats

551
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,360
from ap nic

552
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,200
you'll see that you know

553
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,360
the whole world

554
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,520
the rtt of ipv6 is slightly higher but

555
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,279
it's largely you know because of you

556
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,200
know swing me

557
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,039
if you look at the world you know

558
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,279
american and europe actually you know

559
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,480
ipv6 performed better than ipv4

560
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,440
so i i really feel that these data are

561
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,760
useful for

562
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,960
for communicating with the ipv6 deniers

563
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,279
you know when they say that oh it's bad

564
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,679
you can you you you have the stats to to

565
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,080
tell them the work uh if you look deeper

566
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,640
what's the case and also there are

567
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,240
reports that

568
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,120
ipv6 can perform better in

569
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,080
enterprises for example we provide two

570
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,559
references here you know

571
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,200
apple at one place is claiming that you

572
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,679
know ipv6 can be you know 40 better

573
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,559
in the in the data center again you know

574
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,559
we provided the reference here you can

575
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,520
check out and facebook is also very

576
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,480
enthusiastic

577
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,399
in in

578
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,720
promoting ipv6 so i think the point here

579
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,440
our real point our real point here is

580
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,720
that ipv6 can perform better than ipv4

581
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,000
if

582
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,720
if you you have a lot of talent if you

583
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,600
can do it you know correctly but it's

584
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,240
not always easy this is this is a

585
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,960
complicated machine and if you install

586
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,159
it you know correctly you operate it

587
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,240
correctly then you perform better than

588
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,360
uh

589
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,320
ipv4 but because it's due to its

590
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,919
complexity

591
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,840
you may make mistakes and if you make

592
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,879
mistake then it don't

593
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,120
so i think that this is the concern that

594
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,720
we want to

595
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,120
want to provide

596
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,520
um

597
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,840
as a consequence i think that this is

598
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,600
also another thing that i find

599
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,039
as a big surprise to me last year and it

600
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,760
may actually be a big surprise to many

601
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,840
ipv6 bathrooms

602
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,880
is that

603
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,120
many operators

604
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,480
ipv6 deployment are actually in overlay

605
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,640
and in the underlay in the router et

606
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,120
cetera they're actually tunneling ipv6

607
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,039
nprs etc

608
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,520
so you know when the operator tell you

609
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,919
that oh i do deal stack

610
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,640
you think that you know their routers

611
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,159
are transporting ipv6 traffic natively

612
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,080
you think that their underlay is also

613
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
dual stack but that may not be the case

614
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,760
that may not be the case this is a big

615
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,440
surprise for me

616
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,159
last year so first of all let's uh let

617
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,159
me clarify what's overlay and what

618
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,559
underlay i think this is this is a

619
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,960
notion it's applicable to operators and

620
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,760
to some extent also applicable to

621
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,840
to data center but it's not applicable

622
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,240
to for enterprise if you are not

623
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,799
providing a cervix to other people you

624
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,640
really don't have this like distinction

625
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,360
between overlay and underlay but anyhow

626
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,880
for operator

627
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,600
overlay is the cervix layer and it

628
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,480
involves the the user device

629
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,120
and also the mobile gateway of bng or

630
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,840
etc this is your kind of like your

631
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,320
service lady and then underlays your

632
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,600
routers etc is the the the to send the

633
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,840
send the package

634
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,960
um

635
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,080
because ipv6 is i think the the number

636
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,440
one

637
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,720
reason is to address this

638
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
address sorties you know to provide

639
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,279
enough address and if to do that then

640
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,320
ipv6 overlay is sufficient

641
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,880
it's sufficient and why operators don't

642
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,520
want to you know many operators

643
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,640
don't do

644
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,039
native i ipv

645
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,760
6 packaging talk is because

646
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,799
if your router is still stacked

647
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,520
really dual stack then you need a

648
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,919
a control plane management plane data

649
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,600
plane for ipv4 you have need a separate

650
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,559
plane

651
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,240
for ipv6

652
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,000
however if you just turn on ipv6 packet

653
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,679
inside ipv4 then you only need a single

654
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,480
you know data and control management

655
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,360
click so many operators feel that okay

656
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,320
you know

657
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,720
actually it will be easier for me to

658
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,279
maintain just one per play then two

659
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,399
separate play and there are many of them

660
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,720
are using 6pe sets

661
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
so

662
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,360
some of the ipv6 veterans thought that

663
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,720
operators ipv6 is largely done but this

664
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,480
is really not the case first there are

665
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,519
many big operators still doing ipv4 and

666
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,919
even for those already deployed ipv6

667
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,880
that ipv6 may still just in the overlay

668
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,720
not much in the underlay so this is

669
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,840
again you know back to the question that

670
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,320
we need to make ipv6 perform better we

671
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,399
need to identify the challenges and make

672
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,080
ipv6 perform better than ipv4 otherwise

673
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,480
otherwise you know there are still a big

674
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,440
part of operator network can remain in

675
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,240
ipv for all you know there are there are

676
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,919
many consequence

677
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,600
so here uh

678
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,799
how to

679
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,799
make ipv6 perform better than ipv4

680
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,799
there are these answers the first two

681
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,880
came from jeff houston

682
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
the first two point that came from jeff

683
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,720
houston he actually have three points

684
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,200
but i had to delete one point because

685
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,960
you know that point received a lot of

686
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,519
protest the deleted point is that he

687
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,840
said that you should avoid

688
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,880
stateful

689
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,200
ipv4 to ipv6 transition

690
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,159
and then

691
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,840
kind of that you know is closed for

692
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,039
example

693
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,760
six four x lab etcetera i'll receive a

694
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,159
lot of you know protest from that point

695
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,720
so you know in the end i delete it

696
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,159
um

697
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,399
there are other points the the next five

698
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,679
points you know

699
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,399
below the below the the white space the

700
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,640
the other six points are

701
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,880
the five points are you know based on

702
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,000
our analysis first is move content

703
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,200
closer to end user this will improve

704
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,760
both ipv4 performance and ipv6

705
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,240
performance but there are data showing

706
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,480
that you know the improvement for ipv6

707
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,760
is actually

708
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,240
uh bigger than for ipv4 so if it

709
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,840
close the gap or even you know

710
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,320
uh change the change the wind

711
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,640
there are some explanation and but we

712
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,399
don't have the time to go into detail

713
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,159
why this is the case

714
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,200
uh increase link mtu if you can and

715
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,399
change the choose the tcp mss

716
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,039
these are all to avoid trying to avoid

717
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,120
recommendation because of fragmentation

718
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,919
if it happened ego ego caused very high

719
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,320
packet loss rate and then there's this

720
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,279
like announcing ipv6 route and

721
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,559
fee altering

722
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,519
jeff houston provided some example that

723
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,360
you know if you don't do it you

724
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,960
basically provide for example that

725
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,720
between australia and singapore ipv4 is

726
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,600
australia to singapore directly back to

727
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,039
to australia but for ipv6 turkey goes

728
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,240
along australia to singapore to germany

729
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,559
to us and then back to australia then

730
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,799
obviously you are going to have a lot

731
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,799
higher

732
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,279
chip delay and possibly packet loss and

733
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,000
then there's this package filtering

734
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,360
i would say that here we provide some

735
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,159
some

736
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,120
references some references

737
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,480
but

738
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,800
more work probably need to be done or at

739
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,599
least even always you know discuss and

740
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,079
document these challenges and then

741
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,399
provide guidelines provide a guideline

742
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,839
on all of these you know what can make

743
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,520
ipv6 better

744
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,800
so this is the second part and the third

745
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,599
part is looking forward as we said

746
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,440
if you look at the wall avalanche it

747
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,839
seems like ipv6 seems to be a little

748
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,960
worse but if you look at you know deeper

749
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,320
actually

750
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,839
as we say if you do ipv6 correctly ipv6

751
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,000
can perform better than ipv4 just like

752
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,800
in america and in europe

753
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,760
so

754
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,719
if we look at the the world today i know

755
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,639
that this is a busy slide and you will

756
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,800
not be able to tell the company or read

757
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,040
the small numbers i think that there are

758
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,200
only two inclusion that i want to get

759
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,599
want you to get from this slide first is

760
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,720
that there are many companies with very

761
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,560
high ipv6

762
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,520
uh user percentage already

763
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,760
starting from the you know the top one

764
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,040
is 100 ipv6 and even the bottom one is

765
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
still like 57

766
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,440
it's still 57 percent

767
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,359
um as we said

768
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,400
these are companies that do ipv6 uh

769
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,240
correctly and benefit from egg

770
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,960
[Music]

771
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,839
they can already move to ipv6 only they

772
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,040
can already to move to ipv6 only and

773
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,599
brian carpenter told me that you know

774
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,920
every time you talk about ipv6 only you

775
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,400
should immediately say that ipv4 as a

776
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,359
service over ipv6 because otherwise

777
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,880
people will say that oh this guy is a

778
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,760
political how how how can you be you

779
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,359
know ipv4 will stay for many many years

780
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,359
they thought that ipv6 only means like

781
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,760
no ipv4 but it's not the case it just

782
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,720
means that you know ipv4 will be long as

783
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,760
a cervix over ipv6 but it will disappear

784
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,920
from the infrastructure

785
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,880
layer

786
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,400
so it's the the time to to do so and

787
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,839
here you know will be a little bit more

788
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,079
specific so at least from an operator

789
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,079
perspective you know facebook already

790
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,640
done it i think the hyper scale

791
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,800
the hyper scale have a lot of talent

792
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
they probably have you know the best

793
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,040
talent in the industry and they have no

794
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,839
problem you know they can they they

795
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,240
they they they can do uh

796
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,440
whatever

797
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,160
but for some operators it may not be so

798
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,079
clear so we're kind of like you know

799
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,760
draw some picture

800
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,160
um i think the mobile one we kind of

801
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,240
like use four six four x a lot as an

802
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,720
example and the first one is a little

803
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,920
bit like uh

804
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,880
you know

805
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,640
quite dislike or you know one of those

806
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,280
solutions but the the real difference is

807
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,040
that i think that ipv6 only at the

808
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,280
moment in the industry

809
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,119
for some people it doesn't mean that

810
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,520
ipv4 as a cervix again you know it's

811
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,920
just in the overlay and here we want to

812
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,720
make sure that you know by ipv6 only we

813
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,200
not only mean overlay we really mean you

814
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,400
know underlay

815
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,079
and the ipv4

816
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,079
the package will be tunneling inside

817
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,680
ipv6 will be finally inside ipv6 we

818
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,240
believe that this will further improve

819
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,040
the performance of ipv6 and make it

820
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,839
better than ipv4

821
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,760
so this is

822
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,560
largely the the kind of like

823
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,640
the last slide before summary is that

824
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,960
we

825
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,839
the difference between these one and the

826
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,400
ipv6 overlaid is that we believe that

827
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,960
you know the if you do do the today's

828
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,720
way ipv6 overlay plus ipv4 underlay you

829
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,839
are basically you you have no exit

830
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,240
strategy because you your your underlay

831
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,560
is stuck even though that your ipv6

832
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,040
traffic is increasing but you know you

833
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,599
you don't change your underlay and

834
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,400
if

835
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,800
you always have you know two protocol

836
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,400
but even though if you tunnel your ipv6

837
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,480
traffic ipv4 over ipv6 because all ipv4

838
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,839
is is

839
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,520
becoming a smaller and smaller

840
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,000
percentage then you know one day you can

841
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,640
finally just purely ip

842
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,480
purely ipv6 and really these require

843
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,720
solving some of the challenges that we

844
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
talked about in this

845
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,160
presentation

846
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,670
um

847
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,960
[Music]

848
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,920
really we need the the health of ietf

849
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,240
and the leading operators we really need

850
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,320
first we need to document all the

851
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,359
challenges and provide guidelines

852
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,720
so this brings me to the summary again

853
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,960
we want to emphasize with our feelings

854
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,480
that it's like a sophisticated machine

855
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,520
only if you can install and operate it

856
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,000
well it will be better than ipv4

857
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,800
otherwise it can be worse then it can be

858
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,400
worse than ipv4

859
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,119
and in this aspect we really need you

860
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,839
know ietf to kind of like provide kind

861
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,560
of like better user guideline to make

862
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,880
sure that you know uh people

863
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,960
will have a higher chance of you know

864
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,839
install and operate it

865
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,040
correctly

866
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,720
um

867
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,520
these if we do this then we can we can

868
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,119
you know accelerate the move to ipv6 and

869
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,200
ipv6 only and here we will specifically

870
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,040
list some topics

871
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,960
that we hope to get your contribution

872
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,280
i i will pause here and let you uh

873
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,280
a few seconds to read it i also provide

874
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,440
my contact information

875
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,839
so we love to to hear from you

876
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,119
thank you very much

877
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,079
i think you don't usually get a

878
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,599
approach in ietf so i feel really

879
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,599
honored

880
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,119
any any questions comments

881
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,560
i cut in front of you last time you go

882
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,560
ahead

883
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,399
do you want to speak

884
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,960
i hope you guys can hear me

885
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,079
so i have a question

886
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,040
um

887
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,400
you talked about uh there having been

888
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,560
some work done to measure the

889
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,720
performance improvements

890
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,960
um and that performance improvement for

891
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,240
ipv6 being larger than the performance

892
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,040
improvement for ipv4 when you

893
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,359
talk about uh dealing with keep edge or

894
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,319
deep in the network deployed content key

895
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,960
so i was just wondering if you have any

896
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,040
uh study or

897
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,359
reference material that i can look at

898
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,359
uh you know because that is an area of

899
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,359
great interest for me and the

900
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,280
organization that i work for

901
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,240
and uh we'd love to we're already kind

902
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,040
of

903
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,079
semi dual stack but we deploy in a lot

904
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,280
of networks which are till to this day

905
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,880
large uh you know consumer facing isps

906
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,839
that are ipv4 only so we'd love to be

907
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,000
able to show some statistics and you

908
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,160
know try to help move the needle with

909
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,000
these uh you know medium mid-sized isps

910
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,560
who you know i have just not got onto

911
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,200
the ipv6 bandwagon

912
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,160
uh okay i i think we should probably you

913
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
know take this discussion offline

914
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,359
because

915
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,760
uh it will it one is it will take a lot

916
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,000
of time and a second you know i cannot

917
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,720
remember you know all the all the you

918
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,960
know the the the reference so i can send

919
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,200
you the reference afterwards

920
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,680
i i will definitely email you and we'll

921
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,440
we'll take this up

922
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,839
offline but then um you know it it this

923
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,560
is a very interesting data point to have

924
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,720
because we as service providers who are

925
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,079
going into these deep network locations

926
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,200
we would love to have some uh you know

927
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,760
ammunition so that when we go to these

928
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,480
providers who are reluctant to

929
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,760
you know uh embrace ipv6 we have

930
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,680
something that we can show them and say

931
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,760
it's in your interest to do this even

932
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,920
though uh you know you don't mean you

933
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,760
may not see a pressing commercial need

934
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,640
to do it right now but hey here's a case

935
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,560
for a performance improvement for your

936
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,800
customers that should uh you know help

937
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,640
you make the decision to go ahead and do

938
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,400
this

939
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,319
okay thank you rajiv

940
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,960
uh journaling over google as an

941
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,119
enterprise operator who spent some time

942
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,119
operating dual stack and v6 only network

943
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,760
i have an impression that my experience

944
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,240
every single case when you see v6

945
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,400
performance worse than before

946
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,359
is because of api balls because v6

947
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,680
network is broken nobody monitoring

948
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,920
could because of happy eyeballs users

949
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,319
are not complaining and it stays like

950
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,800
that until you turn off ipv4

951
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,359
so i'm quite sure it's not something in

952
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,440
the protocol not something in the

953
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,680
connectivity it's just bad operational

954
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
practices

955
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,319
okay yes i think that that's that's kind

956
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,920
of what we are saying that you know the

957
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,319
machine itself is fine but you know if

958
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,440
you don't operate it correctly

959
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,200
then it has problems

960
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,160
hi this is barry lieber

961
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,839
can you go back to the slide where you

962
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,240
show the performance differences in

963
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,760
different regions

964
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,400
and i'm curious on that yeah just you

965
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,319
just passed it now go

966
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,240
back the other way

967
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,000
next one

968
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,760
that one um

969
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,119
do you have any sense of why oceania is

970
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,000
so bad compared with the other regions

971
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,520
i

972
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,720
i don't

973
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,319
okay because

974
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,160
i think that you know this is a slide

975
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,359
that i newly added and i today i went to

976
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,240
the the ap unique data and copy this i

977
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,480
think that this but i think that it's a

978
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,000
good question that we can probably

979
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,560
discuss together with jeff houston

980
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,040
okay thanks

981
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,240
hi mike ackerman first off i want to say

982
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,000
that you covered a lot of information

983
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,839
this is really good stuff i hope you'll

984
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,440
come back and do it again it's almost

985
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,359
inspirational thank you um the uh first

986
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,400
question i want to ask maybe somebody

987
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,839
already did can we get copies of your

988
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,480
slides yes fantastic

989
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,079
uh and then i just wanted to ask one

990
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,839
specific question i got your email i got

991
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,720
a whole bunch more so beware um

992
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,400
you had a slide that said

993
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,800
and it's right up there it's uh

994
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,839
that ipv6 performs better in enterprises

995
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,680
i'm one of those can you is there a

996
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,200
short answer as to why or how

997
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,680
we

998
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,598
see it in this uh

999
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,319
for example let me let me take facebook

1000
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,400
as a example you know facebook we we

1001
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,480
provide here you know this

1002
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,599
link to a youtube video and in this

1003
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,079
youtube video i believe that the

1004
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,800
person's name is taught

1005
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,680
uh

1006
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,040
well it's a a facebook person talking

1007
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,720
about uh

1008
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,240
ipv6 his ipv6 performance is better than

1009
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,040
ipv4 i i remember using a nano meeting

1010
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,880
or in some kind of meeting and then

1011
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,480
there are people

1012
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,440
flown from the audience

1013
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,000
asked the same question that you just

1014
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,839
asked yeah we want to know that those

1015
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,240
people i think that you know uh they

1016
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,119
provide some kind of i i will not say

1017
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,280
that it's it's a very direct answer they

1018
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,480
say well for example if you do ipv6 then

1019
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,079
you have no net

1020
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,440
but really

1021
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,640
nat

1022
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,800
will introduce only a very small

1023
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,920
difference

1024
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,200
so ipv6 is better is it really because

1025
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,960
of ned or because of some other reasons

1026
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,359
we didn't get a a

1027
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,400
very clear answer from that uh youtube

1028
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,000
detail i think we have the reference

1029
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,280
okay yeah

1030
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,200
okay you can take a look hoping there

1031
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
was some great generic answer but it

1032
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,960
could be application or situational

1033
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,400
specific and that that's certainly

1034
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,040
understandable but yes we actually we

1035
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,560
really i think like these are the

1036
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,720
questions that we should dig into and

1037
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,960
this is why we are doing this and

1038
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,440
actually maybe maybe jane also you know

1039
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,920
have some comments do you for example in

1040
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,520
your google network do you feel that

1041
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,400
ipv6 perform better or you know

1042
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,040
if it performs better why i definitely

1043
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,640
wrote down what she just said that when

1044
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,119
you get to ipv6 only and that makes a

1045
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,400
lot of sense you can see where the

1046
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,560
economies the scale will start to add up

1047
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,079
and give you better performance maybe

1048
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,240
even holistically so

1049
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,680
i'm just looking for any answers

1050
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,119
anywhere i can get it and this was great

1051
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,640
thank you again uh thank you

1052
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,760
so we are already

1053
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,440
5 30

1054
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,240
and if there are no more questions i

1055
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,598
really want to uh

1056
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,520
rajiv you have another question

1057
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,440
quick question um

1058
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,400
if it's not too late

1059
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,520
go ahead rajiv here

1060
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,520
go ahead

1061
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,760
yeah so this is again relating to the

1062
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,160
difference um so while

1063
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,400
in this table you're kind of showing the

1064
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,800
average uh difference in the

1065
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,079
rtts uh and and yes based on these

1066
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,640
numbers oceania looks like it's a

1067
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,800
massive outlier with a much larger

1068
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,400
average but uh i probably am not as

1069
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,160
surprised by that because it's quite

1070
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,200
likely

1071
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,880
that the

1072
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,119
overall total rtt

1073
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,760
average for connections in oceania are

1074
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,240
probably going to be a whole lot higher

1075
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,559
because of the fact that it has very

1076
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,440
limited uh capabilities of serving

1077
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,520
traffic locally and most traffic

1078
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,079
originating from there is reaching out

1079
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,400
to some other region of the world um in

1080
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,920
order to get served which is not the

1081
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,440
case with maybe uh america's uh or

1082
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,280
europe or for that matter even asia

1083
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,200
because a lot of that traffic will be

1084
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,800
within the region

1085
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,119
okay so a lot of asia is going to be

1086
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,800
served out of china or india or

1087
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,880
singapore and you know doesn't really

1088
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,960
have to go outside the region so when

1089
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,240
the total

1090
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,440
uh

1091
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,520
connection rtts are

1092
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,839
in the range of 40 or 50 milliseconds

1093
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,480
their 10 difference turns out to be four

1094
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,000
milliseconds perfect

1095
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,640
with oceania if they're if the average

1096
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,119
of their connections are mostly going

1097
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,160
to be in the 300 and 400 millisecond rtt

1098
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,160
range because they're all going outside

1099
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,520
of the oceania region to get served a 10

1100
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,520
differential in performance would still

1101
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,359
look like a very big difference over

1102
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,319
here so i'm my question is have you

1103
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,720
looked at that as a data point

1104
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,200
while doing this analysis

1105
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,280
uh the the answer is no as i said you

1106
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,599
know this slide i added today you know

1107
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,960
upon the request of a colleague but i i

1108
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,119
can offer a

1109
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,000
observation is that you know if you know

1110
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,640
jeff houston how he how he collects his

1111
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,359
statistics he's basically partnering

1112
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,319
with google and you know uh

1113
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,440
uh putting a kind of like an ad on the

1114
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,920
you know chrome browser and then this

1115
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,640
chrome browser will contact his you know

1116
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,280
he's he's he's a prober let's say and

1117
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,079
then

1118
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,640
um because this is sampling this is

1119
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,720
stinkling so i

1120
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,520
do the the observation that you know

1121
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,720
at different time these can you know for

1122
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,359
example tomorrow if you go to you know

1123
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,520
jeff houston's side and then take

1124
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,000
another snapshot the number can be quite

1125
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,119
different

1126
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,040
so i think that this is this is point

1127
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,520
number one this you cannot definitely

1128
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,160
not uh you know draw a conclusion that

1129
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,680
you know osun is always is always bad so

1130
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,559
again you know all of these you know uh

1131
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,680
every statistics you must also look at

1132
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,599
each flow uh you know kind of like take

1133
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,400
it with a grain of salt with a grain of

1134
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,680
salt you know

1135
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,240
really tomorrow we when we look at the

1136
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,480
the one and just now when you talk about

1137
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,520
the

1138
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,079
the maybe you know oceania is far away

1139
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,720
from kang tang but again we are here we

1140
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,319
are talking about the difference between

1141
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,839
ipv4 and ipv6 and the long distance you

1142
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,520
know is a burden for both ipv4 and ipv6

1143
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,680
so arguably you know it shouldn't create

1144
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,079
a lot of difference but other than that

1145
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,319
really i'm sorry you know

1146
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,359
i

1147
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,160
i

1148
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,359
i really feel that that for ipv6

1149
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,920
performance

1150
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,839
there

1151
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,160
are a lot of analysis is worth doing

1152
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,559
because we really you know no

1153
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,960
i would say that we know very little and

1154
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,319
if we we just support ipv6 and we don't

1155
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,280
face these challenges

1156
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,680
they will not just go away so i think

1157
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,160
this is why you know i i i like to do

1158
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,240
this talk and kind of like expose these

1159
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,640
challenges and so that you know we can

1160
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,520
you know do something together

1161
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,040
thank you that was very informative

1162
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,839
well

1163
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,078
uh

1164
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,880
let me thank all of you very much for

1165
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,319
spending the afternoon with us i really

1166
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,480
appreciate it and you got my contact

1167
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,000
information

1168
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,960
and we really love to to hear from you

1169
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,160
so

1170
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,879
again bye now

1171
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,799
thank you so you

1172
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,599
you
