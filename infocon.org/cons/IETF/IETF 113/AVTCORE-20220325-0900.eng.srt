video is encouraged but not required but

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,360
you have to enable videos and audio

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,840
separately

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,238
here's the general links for things

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
uh

55
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,200
hopefully nobody has any issues but if

56
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,080
you do here's how to do them report them

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,159
note well

58
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,360
hopefully everybody here has seen this

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,200
before but

60
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,879
uh especially because you had to see it

61
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,200
when you registered but in general

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,640
this is the

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,400
policies and procedures

64
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,639

65
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,160
ipr and consent to recording and

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
code of conduct

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,080
in particular uh fortunately we seem to

68
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,600
don't seem to have problems with this

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
group but just a reminder to treat

70
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,600
everybody professionally and with

71
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,440
respect and dignity

72
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,720
um

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
in general behave like a good person

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
about this meeting

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,720
agenda notes

76
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
stefan has volunteered to take notes but

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
he will not be using the

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
uh

79
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
the cody md because

80
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,720
he prefers microsoft word but if anybody

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,960
wants to take notes and code emd

82
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,280
they can um

83
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,840
if anybody

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
uh wants to monitor the

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,639
jabber room that would be appreciated

86
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,840
because i might be juggling too many

87
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
things but if not i probably can help

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
that also

89
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
um i think

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
bernard said he would monitor the queue

91
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,880
while i do the slides in the jabber is

92
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,520
that right bernard

93
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,479
or people can presenters can manage

94
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,840
their own queue if they can see it right

95
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,120
yeah by the way you do have a bit of hum

96
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,160
bernard so you might want to

97
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,160
or maybe that's the room i don't know

98
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,360
we'll see what happens over this okay

99
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
here's the agenda

100
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,880
start with a brief discussion of

101
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,800
uh crypto

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
cryptex

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
and then skip

104
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,960
uh

105
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,240
the 7983 bis that's the demultiplexing

106
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,759
some stp for

107
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,759
rtp over quick and gaming goes over

108
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,479
quick

109
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,919
and then i think colin had a suggestion

110
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,680
for an agenda bash because we have a bit

111
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
of time colin go ahead

112
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
yeah i'm just hoping given this time at

113
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
the end that we could have some

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,199
discussion around this uh sure and i

115
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,720
didn't say my name colin jennings uh

116
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,360
these short tags on

117
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,479
um

118
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,240
that we've been discussing for years and

119
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,080
i think i've got a way of of us thinking

120
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,919
about this that might help really help

121
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
us get to a decision i'm not proposing

122
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,919
we'd get to a decision pay or anything

123
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,360
we'd go do that at the end so i'd like

124
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,560
to put some time at the end if we have

125
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
for that for maybe 10 minutes or so

126
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
that should be fine because we have a

127
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,680
fair bit of time as you can see

128
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,120
all right uh document status

129
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,880
uh i'm not positive these all been

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
published in our last meeting but we

131
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,280
have published them so that's good

132
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,799
and

133
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,440
vp9

134
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
is still in misrep

135
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,759
because of

136
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,360
i think an indirect reference on frame

137
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
marking which is why we've done back on

138
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
frame marking uh cryptex is an itf last

139
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,840
call but we have a few comments on that

140
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,319
some issues that came up

141
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,840
uh during last call i don't know if they

142
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
were because of last call or just

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,080
because that's when richard happened to

144
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,280
look at it but

145
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,120
um i think we'll have a little bit of

146
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
discussion of that in a bit

147
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,400
um

148
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,599
and we've adopted a few other drafts

149
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,560
uh

150
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,840
just one issue we wanted to

151
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,720
uh ahead

152
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,280
yeah this one uh came up as part of when

153
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
i'm doing the write-up you know it asks

154
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,400
if

155
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,240
about the ipr declarations and whether

156
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,400
the working group has discussed this i

157
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
did post

158
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,120

159
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
an email to the list

160
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
uh and basically the

161
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,000
what the

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
pub wreck requests is that the working

163
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,599
group has discussed this and that there

164
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,080
aren't objections to proceeding

165
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,560
so i just wanted to point this out and

166
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,879
allow anybody who wishes to speak to do

167
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,120
so

168
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,680
okay so if anybody

169
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,840
has any issues with

170
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
these ipr declarations on the bbc

171
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
payload format

172
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
uh please let the working group

173
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,400
um if we hear no objections we'll assume

174
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,680
the working group is fine with that and

175
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,440
we'll proceed with um

176
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,080
um

177
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,680
proceed with uh request publication

178
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,400
yeah just just to note so march 8th we

179
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,599
submitted the thing to the list we

180
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,680
haven't gotten any objections

181
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,759
um are there any objections here

182
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,720
okay i'm not seeing anyone in the queue

183
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
so for the minutes i think we should

184
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
record that there were no objections at

185
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,679
least in the meeting

186
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,679
okay good

187
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,679
okay

188
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,120
all right um

189
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,440
okay

190
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,720
and

191
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,080
so that's

192
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,080
okay

193
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,640
and

194
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,040
uh liaison statements

195
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,800
um

196
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,240
we'll be talking about the what the web

197
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,320
transport one from what did you see in a

198
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,279
second

199
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,959
uh we set the response to the mpeg green

200
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,800
metadata

201
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,839
uh

202
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,360
which i think also got set for it sent

203
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
to the cc to the list

204
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,399
so uh

205
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,000
um

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,640
relating to the green metadata i think

207
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,800
stefan you noted that there was some

208
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
kind of uh update needed to the itf

209
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,560
liaison tracker is that right

210
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,120
we sent it did we send it to the wrong

211
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,600
place or something in contact with us i

212
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
i i thought this is up to date

213
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,200
it should have been up to date i i mean

214
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,320
shinzi

215
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,959
was gone in 2016

216
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,200
right uh and we had liaison traffic

217
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
before i don't know where that stale uh

218
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
address comes from did he use the

219
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,760
tracker or or how he used that we sent

220
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
it using the tracker uh and it

221
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,360
apparently had okay i will look into it

222
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,320
thank you

223
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,200
okay thank you

224
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,640
okay and here's um

225
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
bernard you've been doing this do you

226
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,720
want to talk to this yeah so uh

227
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,480
uh basically will law and uh jan ivar

228
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,959
came to ietf112

229
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,800
this was not a formal request didn't go

230
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,720
through the track or anything but

231
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,000
um

232
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,800
in the w3c web transport working group

233
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
they've been

234
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
creating this api web transport api

235
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,800
based on a bunch of use cases and

236
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,160
they've now discovered that a bunch of

237
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,880
the use cases have problems in fact most

238
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,640
of them have problems

239
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
and the reason they have problems is

240
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,120
because of congestion basically

241
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
lack of support for congestion control

242
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,959
and possibly other things

243
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,800
and so what they're looking for is some

244
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,320
kind of feedback on what they might do

245
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
and it was uh brought up i think by

246
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,399
cullen and the mockbuff which is that

247
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,360
one

248
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,000
proposal is to have some kind of uh enum

249
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
and a constructor that could give some

250
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,880
hints about what you want but they're

251
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
they're basically some of the things

252
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
that are potentially an issue

253
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,079
um is

254
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,079
scenarios where the client is

255
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,519
contributing so that would even be

256
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,920
something like video ingestion or maybe

257
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,440
an interactive use case um where the the

258
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,959
client is using

259
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,880
is not using low latency congestion

260
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,920
control or perhaps is using bbr e1 and

261
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,000
the probe rtt is interfering with video

262
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,120
ingestion

263
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,480
anyway they're trying to figure out if

264
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
there's some guidance that that this

265
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,079
working group

266
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,920
can give them

267
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
to help figure it out and there's two

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,240
things they're asking here i guess

269
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
uh is

270
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,519
selectable congestion control

271
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,399
advisable and second of all measurements

272
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,480
what measurements uh they could they

273
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,600
could offer

274
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
i think these are two distinct things

275
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,480
they've made some progress on the

276
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
measurement stuff and stats

277
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
uh but

278
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,079
you know the app can't do its own

279
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,399
congestion control that has to be has to

280
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,920
be below it

281
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,160
so that doesn't necessarily address the

282
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,760
congestion problem

283
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
so the question is what what can this

284
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,600
working group

285
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,800
tell them or advise them to do

286
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,240
or is there some other working group

287
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
that might might be helpful to them

288
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,639
so that's uh so i did some next slide uh

289
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,040
jonathan so i did post a message to the

290
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,639
list trying to solicit a discussion

291
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,320
uh usually the best way in the itf to

292
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,839
solicit a discussion is to post

293
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,160
something completely insane and then

294
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,440
people will respond to try to come make

295
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,240
something better my uh email may not

296
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,839
have been stupid enough

297
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
so we didn't get any responses

298
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,800
so we thought we'd try to

299
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
get some people to the mic and

300
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,720
make suggestions about what what we

301
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,880
might do in response to this liaison

302
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,760
does anybody have any thoughts

303
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,399
moe

304
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,399
uh mosinetti we had an entire working

305
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,839
group at itf

306
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,120
on this uh rmcat and i think as lars

307
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,600
pointed out uh yesterday you know that

308
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,839
not really success coming out of that

309
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,519
you know as a clear consensus on what

310
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,120
techniques or what standards or what

311
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,440
protocols to use for media congestion

312
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,600
control i don't think avt core is going

313
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,720
to be able to come up with anything

314
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,040
better than armchat

315
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,519
came up with over years of of work i

316
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,760
think the clear need is is known uh we

317
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
we know that traditional congestion

318
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,839
controls like you know tcp based ones

319
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,120
like bbr and you know renoish things are

320
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
not ideal for media i think everyone

321
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,440
knows that a better rate control a

322
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
better congestion control

323
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,399
for

324
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,160
for media

325
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,800
with feedback to the application about

326
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
what it's doing so that applications can

327
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,240
make intelligent decisions about what

328
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,760
media it's selecting

329
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,880
and how it's configuring its sources

330
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,480
is definitely needed but i don't think

331
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,560
avt core will be able to

332
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
to do anything about it um if armchat

333
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,279
uh couldn't then

334
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,880
it's doubtful that we'll be able to do

335
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,079
something soon

336
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,079
well well that itself mo could be a

337
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,600
could be a response right just point

338
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,760
them to the rm calf drafts and

339
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
basically say something along with lines

340
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
of what you just said i i think the

341
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,199
practical thing to do for people that

342
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,880
care about this is let's try to iterate

343
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,920
very fast on what exists so take bbr v2

344
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,279
see what tweaks you can add to it to

345
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,160
make it more media friendly take gcc and

346
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,000
see what tweaks you can add to make it

347
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,959
more

348
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,839
combination media and you know long live

349
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,120
flow

350
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,760
friendly and see if by implementation we

351
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
can iterate

352
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,720
into something that's usable

353
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
um because i don't think you know

354
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,320
standardization and you know working

355
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
groups for years has has been

356
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
fruitful

357
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,199
so uh question mo would you be willing

358
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,199
to volunteer to draft something along

359
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,440
the lines of what you just said

360
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
when you say draft image just an email

361
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
to a list or do you mean an actual yeah

362
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,839
just

363
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,240
reply to this email and say hey here's

364
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
what i recommend saying sure

365
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,000
no no problem and and i'd also

366
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,079
volunteered you know to spend energy

367
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,839
with anyone that wants to

368
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
uh iterate on those uh current

369
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,279
congestion controls to make it more

370
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,880
media friendly we'll definitely invite

371
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,279
that too and i'll add that to the

372
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,959
wherever we want to collaborate on that

373
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,839
i'll add that to the list

374
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,760
colin

375
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,240
hi um yeah so as as a

376
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
co-chair of our own cater i was going to

377
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
say roughly what um mood just said uh

378
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,839
obviously we have the rmk working group

379
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,320
and um it did develop um a few

380
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,399
rfcs in this space

381
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,759
and there are a couple of congestion

382
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,120
control algorithms that have been

383
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,600
published with rfcs uh and some which

384
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,040
have been discussed and not published as

385
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
rfcs um

386
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,600
and as far as i am aware they all work

387
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,240
uh and uh you know they seem to work

388
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,839
reasonably well that they they haven't

389
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,360
got uh uptake for various reasons

390
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,199
um in terms of information we need to

391
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,959
provide i mean we did do rfc 8888 on

392
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,959
congestion control feedback

393
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,880
um you know if if you can supply that

394
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
sort of information

395
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,079
if web transport can supply that sort of

396
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,399
information that that would be useful

397
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,000
and probably gives the the sort of

398
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,639
information that's needed um

399
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,360
to do the congestion control feedback

400
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,720
um and i i'd also remind people that the

401
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,199
uh with my other hats on the irtf has

402
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,680
the congestion control research group if

403
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
people want advice on algorithms

404
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,199
so uh

405
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,279
colin when uh

406
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,560
if you could also respond uh to the list

407
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,880
with some some ideas on on what we might

408
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,079
say that would also be helpful

409
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:45,680
so

410
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
totally 100 agree with

411
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,920
what colin and mo just said um i think

412
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,759
i'd like to add into this i i think as

413
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,560
an overall area thing

414
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
we should be looking at

415
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,720
i mean imagine the use case of a browser

416
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,800
that implements web transports and some

417
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,639
days the application that javascript

418
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,240
wants is doing media over the web

419
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
transport and some days it's doing file

420
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
transfer or something more like that i

421
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,400
think that we need to start specifying

422
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,319
ways of putting the hints down i know

423
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,599
there's a common perception that we

424
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
don't do apis at itf but i don't think

425
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,199
that's really true i think we do and we

426
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,839
can and that we should i'm not saying we

427
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,439
define how what the api exactly looks

428
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,039
like but we just sort of you know say

429
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,959
like look we need an api that allows you

430
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,160
to signal the type of following

431
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
information up and down this stack of

432
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,160
all these things has passed us through

433
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,320
and that we start working on um i would

434
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,480
be you know i i've been playing with

435
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,559
congestion control algorithms uh for

436
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,120
media based on vbr v2

437
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
um and have implementations i mean it'd

438
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,640
be very interesting to just i mean we

439
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,919
need to get some progress on this for

440
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,320
media now all of that said i want to

441
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,799
back up and 180 degrees the other

442
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,400
direction i think it's also probably

443
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,160
worth reminding these people you know

444
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
people have run media over tcp for years

445
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
and it works fine right at some level of

446
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,000
file so there is some definite you know

447
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
there's some scale here this is going to

448
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,280
work better what they're whatever

449
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,400
they're doing with nothing is going to

450
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,080
work better than tcp

451
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,160
uh and less well perhaps than some of

452
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,400
the udp algorithms but i i

453
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,080
again i think that the the problem we

454
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,840
have to fix this as congestion control

455
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,879
algorithms okay thanks

456
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,520
sues

457
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,000
yep i i think uh i agree with most of

458
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,880
the things i've said by both colombo and

459
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,559
colin so only thing i would like to add

460
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,080
is that uh

461
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,240
looking at itf as a body and responding

462
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,360
to w3c uh and also given that uh there

463
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,120
is definitely a need for something like

464
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,360
this from multiple site like the mock

465
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,600
mock for example or the the web

466
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,200
transporter with risky guys they needing

467
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,640
something like this

468
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,240
would it make sense to

469
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,160
uh as an itf responding to w3c but we we

470
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,799
make a joint request uh across this

471
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,520
multiple uh workforce to quick working

472
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
group uh with with the uh kind of

473
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
request saying that uh proposal saying

474
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,559
that this this needs to be worked on uh

475
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,240
and basically

476
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,799
get quick working group more involved uh

477
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,640
given that there are multiple

478
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,320
places where this is needed

479
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,880
and also having said that and also the

480
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,520
uh the on the api and the feedback from

481
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,919
the quick transport to the w3 to the web

482
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,559
transport and also w3c

483
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
we definitely need uh a kind of uh

484
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,919
northbound apis that needs to be that

485
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,559
kind of exposes what and uh

486
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,200
uh app interaction feedback kind of uh

487
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,640
um

488
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,320
uh pointer like uh the api endpoint api

489
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,720
that was exposed into the

490
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,400
application so that in application if

491
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,280
not

492
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
uh can't fix the condition control

493
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,679
algorithm but it can react on how the

494
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,200
congestion control

495
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,039
algorithm is doing which is not exposed

496
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,039
into the web transport today so probably

497
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,799
there are a couple of things at the api

498
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,039
level with what exists today and expose

499
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,600
that and second thing is that we uh work

500
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,640
towards as an itf to help this w3c and

501
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,360
other guys to make a formal request to

502
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,000
the quick working group and and

503
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
what are the working groups to work to

504
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,240
solve this problem and i i like i i'd

505
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,880
like to volunteer uh if if we proceed on

506
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,000
this as well

507
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,159
so the quick working group has pointed

508
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,679
out that they don't handle congestion

509
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,200
control that that's

510
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,880
done at other places so i don't think

511
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,559
bringing quick into this

512
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,039
they basically said hey we you know

513
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,400
just

514
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,159
just use some other congestion control

515
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,679
so congestion control group would

516
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,039
probably be

517
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,880
be more appropriate as as was pointed

518
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,840
out

519
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,960
makes sense

520
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,200
thank you

521
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,400
anyway i think we're done with this yeah

522
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
as an individual i'm wondering it might

523
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
be worthwhile to

524
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,880
you know

525
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,640
bring up to the rm cat group using arm

526
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,159
cut algorithms with quick or something

527
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,400
just as a

528
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,679
discussion i don't know what's going to

529
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,679
be the how much traction that's going to

530
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,200
get but just

531
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,360
you know maybe just a guidance on the

532
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,799
existing arm cut algorithms how you'd

533
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,720
use them with quick and which switch

534
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,760
quick extensions you need might be

535
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,158
useful

536
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,320
just to for the notes um

537
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,039
mo is taking the pen and drafting up

538
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,039
something with the help of all these

539
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
people here right

540
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,480
uh yes

541
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,799
thank you

542
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,640
okay

543
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,640
so next is uh cryptex and i think uh

544
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,919
richard are you speaking to this

545
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
uh

546
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
i had

547
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
some things on the

548
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,159
one issue about encryption structure but

549
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,400
i don't know if i said you had others

550
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,919
just other things the same thing

551
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,039
with the next slide

552
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,480
i think i may have given you side

553
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,080
control but let's see

554
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,399
yeah i gave you side control richard uh

555
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,720
fascinating and i'm not trying to see

556
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,679
that

557
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,679
okay

558
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
hold on let me see let me take it back

559
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,039
does that take it back for me

560
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,760
okay i'm quite

561
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,679
sure me try okay i'm clicking past slide

562
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,200
control

563
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
no hold on i think something weird has

564
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,440
happened uh sergio drove i might have to

565
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,120
stop and restart the presentation

566
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,280
what's happened here

567
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,880
so i just sent you a request to share

568
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,039
slides maybe if you grant that i can

569
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,919
just share the deck

570
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,039
so one thing i learned is you have

571
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,480
okay i'm saying i'm i'm still seeing the

572
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,520
slides

573
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,799
i don't know how to stop sharing the

574
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,880
slides

575
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,440
well i can just ask you to flip them

576
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
oh no i think i i have lost control of

577
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,000
the slides

578
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,440
i'm reloading myself to see what that if

579
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,600
that helps

580
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,520
oh now i'm not reloading at all

581
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,639
i'm just timing out

582
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,960
there's someone with chair privileges

583
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,880
i've sent a slide request and i i'm

584
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,440
happy to just uh

585
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,080
uh do you want me to try to load him

586
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,320
jonathan or uh so do we still see this

587
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
so i still see the slides here but i'm

588
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,880
not sure who's actually scaring them

589
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,840
so i'm not sure how we revoked

590
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,158
that uh

591
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
i i am seeing them and it says jonathan

592
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,080
lennox's slides

593
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,279
uh

594
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,440
no no it says renowned christian how did

595
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,880
that happen they click on the wrong

596
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,039
person

597
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,000
there we go okay

598
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,039
all right let's try this again

599
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,000
uh

600
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,880
share preloaded slides

601
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,640
oh wait hold on sure if you go to the

602
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
slide

603
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
share

604
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,799
here um

605
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
there okay 15. i'll just i'll just drive

606
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
them that's probably easier

607
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,480
yeah okay so

608
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,840
okay so sergio did you want to talk to

609
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,480
these first slides

610
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,440
sergio we don't hear you

611
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,799
now you should hit me yes

612
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,480
yeah so we have failed addressed all the

613
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,440
all the

614
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,520
reviews or the feedback that they were

615
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,880
writing the

616
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,679
in the in the review and we have also

617
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,919
added the content name and the email and

618
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,520
the email address for the iana

619
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,960
registration

620
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,360
and submitted a new draft facing these

621
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,480
issues i

622
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,520
think that

623
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,080
it has already been reviewed and agreed

624
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,120
that all the feedback has been

625
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,600
already addressed so the only

626
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,480
outstanding issue is the one feedback

627
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,240
that richard provides in the

628
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,200
in the gi repository that it is the

629
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,840
nexus light

630
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
yeah so

631
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,880
britain you want to to comment on on

632
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,000
this

633
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,640
sure yeah i can um comment on this i i

634
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,240
just kind of randomly came along and

635
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,600
reviewed this didn't see the last call

636
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,919
announcements or anything um what i

637
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,880
noticed is there's some ambiguity in um

638
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,520
how this uh document defines encryption

639
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,600
and i think it's a little bit clearer on

640
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
the next slides

641
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,000
um

642
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,240
jonathan if you could go forward yeah um

643
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,880
so so cryptex wants to do this uh kind

644
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,720
of i call it punctured encryption where

645
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,400
you don't encrypt the

646
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
header of the extension data

647
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,640
the

648
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,919
rfc8285 i forget what the exact number

649
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,720
is but the the standard uh format for

650
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
the rtp extension

651
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,240
uh and the problem on the next slide

652
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,919
is you know if you think about

653
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,279
encryption how encryption works like

654
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,320
we've got these two encryption

655
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,279
frameworks that are universally used

656
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,039
aud

657
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,760
takes unitary byte strings for

658
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,799
aad authenticated data and plain text

659
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,760
and of course produces uh ciphertext

660
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,600
um right so you can't do puncturing

661
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,480
there um you need to produce a provide a

662
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,400
unitary plain text for a contiguous

663
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
plain text

664
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,000
and if you're going to use a screen the

665
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,159
other interface is the stream cipher

666
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,760
plus mat construct

667
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,159
um and in that case you can skip around

668
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,159
but you need to tell it you know whether

669
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,840
uh whether you're skipping or whether

670
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,679
you're considering the two blocks of

671
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,520
input to be contiguous

672
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,159
um next slide please

673
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,919
so we kind of need to decide like how

674
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,279
we're gonna we

675
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,080
the the spike before didn't specify

676
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,440
clearly kind of what the input was to

677
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,600
uh the ciphers in these in these two

678
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,320
cases so in the eid case um we need the

679
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,480
continuous plain text in the stream

680
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,159
cipher case we need to know like are we

681
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,080
skipping over some of the key stream

682
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
where are we just you know applying the

683
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,240
key stream to different spots

684
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,120
um

685
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,000
so uh the the we kind of explored two

686
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
options in this pull request next slide

687
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,799
um the first option was to do it kind of

688
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,799
aead style where you would basically

689
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,200
undo the puncture to create uh

690
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,679
contiguous authenticated data in plain

691
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,000
text you run that through the cipher and

692
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
then you undo it like you don't have to

693
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,960
do it this way you could do it with

694
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,440
multi-part inputs to your cipher

695
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,120
but you know logically it would kind of

696
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,399
look like this um

697
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,080
well i'll forward a bit and this is kind

698
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,840
of where the option we ended up liking a

699
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
little better uh because it is focused

700
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,320
on aad which is the the way we hope

701
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,640
things are trending to go in the future

702
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,840
um you know kind of universal aed

703
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,360
everywhere the main main drawback is

704
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,919
that it requires this swapping operation

705
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,279
if you're doing things in place or it

706
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,279
requires a complicated more complicated

707
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,440
interface the aead

708
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
um but anyway this is this is the kind

709
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
of the first option to swap things to

710
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,679
make the the inputs contiguous

711
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,559
um next slide please

712
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,720
yeah the other option is to do this um

713
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,480
kind of in place uh stream-like

714
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,880
authentication with uh you know

715
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,919
clarifying that you skipped the uh the

716
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,440
chunk of the key stream that points it

717
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,080
corresponds to the the extension header

718
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,200
um

719
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,960
the the downside to this one is that you

720
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,559
end up locked into the stream cipher

721
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,440
plus hmac framework um which we we

722
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
already are for header encryption but

723
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,600
this would extend it's the whole packet

724
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
and be kind of a downer

725
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,679
so next slide

726
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,559
the proposal here we landed on in the

727
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,520
in the pr is to focus on this aead like

728
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,279
option where you

729
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,760
synthesize the contiguous authenticated

730
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,360
data in plain text

731
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,200
um under the reasoning that you know we

732
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,799
should focus on aed and it's not that

733
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,159
bad to do um to mem copy the the csrc's

734
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,559
around to get the encryption

735
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,480
so that's the summary uh sergio uh

736
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,960
kindly put together pr which i think is

737
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,840
uh

738
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,919
in a landable state right now so i think

739
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,200
we should we should be ready to go here

740
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,600
in terms of solution um but we wanted to

741
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,039
present this here at the meeting in case

742
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,039
folks have thoughts concerns objections

743
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,840
etc

744
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,760
uh colin see you in the queue and i'll

745
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,200
get into those individuals

746
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
so so i mean first of all let me just

747
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
start with yeah 100 proposal one was

748
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,880
alright let's option one let's do this

749
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,880
but this was discussed

750
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
immensely before we even adopted this

751
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,200
document went on and on forever um and

752
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,960
we came to this conclusion that the mem

753
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,919
copy was soup was not an expense and in

754
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,760
fact if you structured the way in your

755
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,039
library that you stored the data

756
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,559
correctly you didn't even need to do it

757
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,919
but no one's going to really do that the

758
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,520
mem cop is cheap

759
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,399
um

760
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,720
and the um

761
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,679
the

762
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,640
that

763
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,000
i

764
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,600
that we were definitely fine with being

765
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,960
just aead and i thought there was an itf

766
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,399
document that said all future work

767
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,720
should be aead but i can't find it now

768
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,760
that i said that um i i'm sorry i sent

769
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,960
an email to the list last night but i

770
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,159
realized i didn't send it to you richard

771
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,279
so my apologies

772
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,960
but i mean i i think that this has been

773
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,480
the intention from all along so i don't

774
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,840
think there should be huge controversy

775
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,360
about this about that

776
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,159
cool

777
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,039
yeah yeah uh jonathan individual this is

778
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,960
what i this is how i implemented it when

779
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,760
i did the the test vectors so

780
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,640
i think

781
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,240
it was what we were always intending and

782
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,159
i guess it's basically richard found us

783
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,200
that we didn't explain it well in the

784
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,640
document so

785
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,760
this is basically just editorial

786
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,600
improvements which is great

787
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,640
cool

788
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,399
so us

789
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,760
it's just a

790
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,880
thought here

791
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,159
i support option one as well but on the

792
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,159
point that cullen made uh if there is no

793
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,480
such document that aea is the future

794
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,720
should we be asking to have such a

795
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,799
document to avoid confusions like this

796
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,960
in the future

797
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,039
uh i don't think that's

798
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,640
i think don't think such a broad scope

799
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,080
of statement is in the scope of this

800
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,200
working group

801
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
if

802
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,039
the itf in general wants to do that

803
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,159
that should come out of the security

804
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,159
area i hope

805
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,760
uh i mean i think in general this means

806
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
that all encryption should be aeid is

807
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,200
pretty well established at least in the

808
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,080
security community

809
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,960
i'm not sure any statement anyway i

810
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
don't know if it's a document to that

811
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
effect or just you know

812
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,080
common knowledge but

813
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,120
it sounds like maybe that's something to

814
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,559
take to sag or something if it doesn't

815
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,760
actually exist

816
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,039
just so that the rest of the community

817
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,440
knows it

818
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,799
all right

819
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,600
uh next up is skip which i think

820
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,519
daniel are you presenting this

821
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,480
um this is mike fowler uh dan is online

822
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,840
too both of us will be presented okay

823
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,440
we'll start with the

824
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,760
next slide

825
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,320
this is just a slide we keep in place to

826
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,159
keep track of background where we come

827
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,039
from

828
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,279
and that we have deployed devices in the

829
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,600
skip in the us and nato community that

830
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,320
are presently using the protocol we

831
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,880
have written a draft rfc for

832
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,120
the problem statement is more along the

833
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,640
line the third bullet that the most

834
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,240
commercial network administration

835
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,640
security personnel are not aware of skip

836
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,320
and can result in the skip media subtype

837
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,480
being removed from an sdp

838
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,919
which is disastrous to us

839
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,679
we'll move on to the

840
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,720
last bullet this i'm sorry

841
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,039
the skip rfc was accepted as abt core

842
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,880
work item in january

843
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,720
comments received have been reviewed and

844
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,799
incorporated into a new draft of this

845
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,360
rfc next slide

846
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,880
and this is what we're looking at two

847
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,440
media subtypes audio skip and video skip

848
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,440
have been registered with ayana as a rtp

849
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,320
media format media types

850
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,480
the rfc is needed to provide additional

851
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,880
information for those media subtypes the

852
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,360
header fields payload format fields

853
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,679
as well as serve as a general awareness

854
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,000
of that skip is out there an example of

855
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,399
the mapping is shown

856
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,760
there with a

857
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,600
with the audio stream

858
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,879
and the video stream

859
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,320
next slide

860
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,360
you call for adoption um dan you want to

861
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,279
take this

862
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,440
sure uh we had the call for adoption

863
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,640
back in

864
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,120
january daniel your audio is kind of low

865
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,399
do you wanna

866
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,799
well we'll try that again is that better

867
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,240
that's better yeah

868
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,840
okay uh yeah we had the call for

869
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,480
adoption back in january um during the

870
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,440
interim

871
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,279
meeting a month ago we had some comments

872
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,960
that were brought in uh to discuss um

873
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,559
what to change so we went ahead and made

874
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,679
those changes uh specifically

875
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,880
uh section 4.1 we changed uh i should do

876
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,480
show

877
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,360
again that was legacy text to support

878
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,880
excuse me texas

879
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,359
some of the very early adopters of the

880
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,719
skip

881
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,918
in our

882
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,000
version of uh internal version if you

883
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,399
will of the spp

884
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,520
didn't quite do it exactly the way we

885
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,079
had specified it but we certainly again

886
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,480
we control this skip protocol in our own

887
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,639
see a working group so we can

888
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,960
certainly make those changes ourselves

889
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,280
to bring those others

890
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,119
up to date

891
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,399
um who also comment regarding uh

892
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,079
whether or not to

893
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,079
pre-packetize skip

894
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,359
um

895
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,918
we basically said no because skip is not

896
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,520
really a

897
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,119
skip is a real-time

898
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,480
protocol

899
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,639
audio and video so it doesn't really

900
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,320
make sense to

901
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
re-packetize it

902
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,040
uh save it as a stream but replay later

903
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,560
also because it's encrypted so

904
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,760
we added a sentence to stipulate not to

905
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,079
repackage skip

906
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,520
um we also uh

907
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,200
updated this the section about the

908
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,040
marker bit um basically saying it's

909
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,560
going to be always going to be zero for

910
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,040
this discontinuous traffic

911
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,160
and

912
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,839
market that will be set

913
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,680
during continuous traffic based on the

914
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,079
underlying media

915
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,240
again because during the continuous

916
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,839
traffic we're basically

917
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,839
uh carrying other other codecs other

918
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,119
registered codecs like milk and g729b

919
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,480
things like that that

920
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,640
already defined how to use

921
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,599
uh the marker bit so we chose to

922
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,880
allow that

923
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,440
to be controlled by that those

924
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,320
codex themselves

925
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,800
next slide

926
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,760
um

927
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,880
for sections five one and five two uh

928
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,119
that are basically i've repeated the

929
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,960
iana registration

930
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,119
uh again we specified n a because

931
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,280
there's no previous versions of the

932
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,920
immediate subtype so that's

933
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,760
the reason why we chose that and left

934
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,200
that in there at this point so

935
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,240
and

936
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,160
again finally for sections eight one and

937
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,640
eight two we move the skip

938
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,240
uh to 14.2 and skip to 10 references

939
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,920
uh from the normative section to the

940
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,079
informational section

941
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,880
and finally we renamed and resubmitted

942
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,560
the draft

943
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,320
with a new name so

944
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,680
that's where we are with that

945
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,160
the next slide

946
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,880
i don't know if mike's you want to go

947
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,200
back to talking about this or these

948
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,480
issues or

949
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,720
sure i'll take that

950
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,079
um

951
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,320
we're here because issues have occurred

952
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,040
between oems and of network equipment

953
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,960
network administrators security

954
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,520
personnel who are unaware of skip and

955
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,599
the ftp contents

956
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,839
necessary to establish our secure

957
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,200
session

958
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,400
so

959
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,560
the skip rfc is a globally accessible

960
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,599
information as to how to handle this

961
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,440
comments we've received from the abt

962
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,520
core call for adoption period have been

963
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,119
reviewed

964
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,880
since then no new comments have been

965
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,800
received so the question

966
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,160
really is

967
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,760
we'll handle questions from you guys and

968
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,359
then we need to know

969
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,400
what our next step is

970
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,839
bernard i'll see you in the queue

971
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,680
uh i think the document is pretty clear

972
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,359
about what needs to be done in the case

973
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,760
of audio basically don't mess with with

974
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,040
the payloads and and uh hopefully your

975
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,640
sbcs will accept the skip audio type i

976
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,160
have a lot of questions though relating

977
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,320
to the video use cases

978
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,280
like

979
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,680
is is skip gonna be used for video

980
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,200
conferencing

981
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,040
uh kind of in an intend encryption

982
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,880
scenario

983
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,200
what are kind of the video video use

984
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,920
cases because in the case of video

985
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,040
as we've been talking about with

986
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,480
end-to-end encryption there there could

987
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,680
be

988
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,359
quite a few other considerations

989
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,800
relating to

990
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,640
you know forwarding headers and all

991
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,759
kinds of kinds of stuff

992
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,599
but um i think the best way to look at

993
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,640
the uh

994
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,119
the video stream is is actually quite

995
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,400
similar to how we handle audio we the

996
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,040
sdp is simply meant to establish a

997
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,760
channel by which the traffic stream will

998
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,119
occur

999
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,359
there's once that

1000
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,240
setting up a secure

1001
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,720
trunk if you want to call it that

1002
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,640
between two endpoints

1003
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,000
the the handling of the the actual

1004
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,240
parameters of the video as well as the

1005
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,240
audio stream too they are handled by um

1006
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,720
by the negotiation that'll occur across

1007
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,000
that link

1008
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,240
so to the to the networking world um

1009
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,000
and those those type that type of

1010
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,079
information is handled elsewhere within

1011
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,960
the skip standards um to the networking

1012
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,040
world that's going what they're going to

1013
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,920
see

1014
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,839
is the sdp and they're going to see

1015
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,160
traffic um there will be marker bit

1016
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,480
it'll be framed

1017
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,680
according to the ietf standards um so

1018
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,000
for instance if it's a video stream

1019
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,280
we're doing a

1020
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,680
secure end to end application layer

1021
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,280
conference

1022
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,520
using h.264

1023
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,440
that will be negotiated within the

1024
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,880
framework of

1025
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,400
that sdp

1026
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,760
and to the ex to anyone looking at that

1027
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,880
traffic stream they will not be able to

1028
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,800
see what that negotiation looks like

1029
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,480
it's just point to point like h.264 or

1030
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,119
is it conferencing

1031
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,960
with that's left to our vendor community

1032
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,280
how they wish to implement across

1033
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,760
that link

1034
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,200
but it's always h264 abc there's no

1035
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,440
temporal scale there's no scalability or

1036
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,960
anything like that

1037
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,359
it's just well

1038
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,800
again

1039
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,560
to some degree that'll be left to the

1040
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,880
vendor how they choose what what

1041
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
protocol they used to run

1042
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,720
and negotiate within

1043
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,359
a secure channel

1044
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,160
into the network it's it's all gonna

1045
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,079
it's gonna look like encrypted traffic

1046
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,440
um

1047
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,920
so the uh

1048
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,040
we believe it'll be h.264 we believe in

1049
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,520
in time they'll be um

1050
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,960
perhaps

1051
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,040
more about the uh how they handle the

1052
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,240
conferencing

1053
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,160
um within these channels they may be

1054
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,000
more than one but

1055
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,480
at least for for now that's the approach

1056
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,440
is that

1057
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,319
we consider it'll be h.264

1058
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,040
yeah so um

1059
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,720
did i understand that correctly that you

1060
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,079
have some some basically invent uh

1061
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,560
negotiation stuff going on there

1062
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,880
and if yes the documents that describe

1063
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,160
that

1064
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,680
assuming these are

1065
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,079
skip documents are these the ones that

1066
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,599
i'm the normative reference and that i

1067
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,200
can read upon request

1068
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,359
they are the ones that will be in the

1069
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,560
normative reference that you can request

1070
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,359
and remember that that all that

1071
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,920
will be seen in the network will be just

1072
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,880
bits

1073
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,359
um it'll be the the encryption stream

1074
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,440
will be established and then

1075
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,040
there'll be some negotiation for

1076
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,680
instance going back to audio will it be

1077
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,560
melp or will it be 729 or will it be

1078
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,839
even a proprietary uh solution for voice

1079
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,440
or for video

1080
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,359
i think i get it i'm just interested how

1081
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,240
this

1082
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,560
is supposed to work because this is this

1083
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,000
kind of an

1084
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,440
unusual way how rtp is employed right

1085
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,280
it's it's it's a little bit following

1086
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,400
the old

1087
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,240
let's throw some mp4 framer frame stuff

1088
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,800
there right everything's is hidden in

1089
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,640
that yeah this actually seems to be

1090
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,599
doing it even a little bit more i'm just

1091
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,880
interested

1092
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,800
how this can

1093
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,680
work and uh but if these documents can

1094
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,000
be made available then i'm read them and

1095
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,200
yeah

1096
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,119
yeah they're actually there actually are

1097
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,520
two deployed products that use video

1098
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,960
right right

1099
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,040
the encryption is is that it's more of

1100
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,040
an application layer so i mean it's not

1101
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,960
within the rtp packet

1102
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,560
itself it's really the payload

1103
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,040
for example

1104
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:52,560
so

1105
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,880
it's not it's not an rtp layer

1106
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,720
encryption

1107
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,319
like the previous slide was talking

1108
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,359
about it's

1109
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,440
it's the actual payload itself

1110
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,960
with mel for 729 for example for audio

1111
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,280
or even for the h264 for video it's uh

1112
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,160
it's the payload is once again isn't

1113
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,760
prickly so

1114
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,599
the header would the header of the

1115
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,599
header would look the same as it would

1116
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,240
for the native code so

1117
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,240
so cullen is saying something in the

1118
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
chat room uh that might be relevant to

1119
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,079
folks he's saying as far as i can tell

1120
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,800
the conferences are all mcu transcode

1121
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,119
style conferences so they're not the

1122
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,200
conferencing is apparently not being

1123
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,079
done using a selective forwarding unit

1124
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,800
which would need some header info to

1125
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,960
decide what to drop

1126
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,800
i know colin you want to say anything

1127
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,960
else

1128
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,880
yeah sure i mean basically i want to say

1129
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,720
like let's say these brought us a

1130
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,079
completely tran

1131
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,200
completely black box um thing that says

1132
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,800
we want to move some data over it we're

1133
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,000
not going to tell you whether it's a

1134
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,160
video or audio codec or whether it you

1135
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,079
know transcodes holograms it'd be

1136
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,760
perfectly fine for us to approve this

1137
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,440
document with no clue of what's inside

1138
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,599
that black box we're talking here about

1139
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,599
just moving it i i don't i don't really

1140
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,359
see the problem with this document like

1141
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,040
this has been done for a long time it's

1142
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,640
widely deployable there's no problem

1143
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,599
with it

1144
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,359
uh it meets the use cases people have

1145
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,800
for it but it's the part that we're

1146
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,880
reviewing of it is

1147
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,400
is

1148
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,880
really just the the registration of the

1149
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,240
payload type we don't really care what's

1150
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,920
inside there so i i think the whole

1151
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,079
thing's fine regardless of what it does

1152
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,160
um that said i mean

1153
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,880
i i you know i i don't i think that

1154
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,640
probably over the long term like maybe

1155
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,000
they would change to do things in a

1156
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,520
different way but uh

1157
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,880
you know i think it works for their

1158
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,240
conferencing use cases so i don't see a

1159
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,319
problem

1160
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,599
sorry i just lost the slides um

1161
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,280
okay

1162
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,359
oh yeah um stefan are you still in the

1163
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,440
queue or is that lingering

1164
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,319
all right no worries uh

1165
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,000
ted did you want to mention the thing

1166
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,680
you said in the chat or are you is that

1167
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,839
uh ted hardy speaking uh so i think what

1168
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,200
i was putting in the chat is is more

1169
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,280
procedural and i think what marie and i

1170
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,200
were talking about is that

1171
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,920
just like you have a down ref called out

1172
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,200
in uh

1173
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,280
in a last call when when this does go to

1174
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,720
last call and i assume the next step

1175
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,400
here is working group last call followed

1176
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,920
by itf

1177
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,680
uh when it does go to last call that

1178
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,800
calling out that the um the the

1179
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,920
documents uh are are probably not going

1180
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,880
to be available um uh

1181
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,240
is the right thing to do because then

1182
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,720
anybody who reads the last call goes in

1183
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,800
and evaluates it on the terms that that

1184
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
colin just laid out knowing that it's

1185
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,400
going to be treated like a black box

1186
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,640
okay i will say i did try and request

1187
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,240
the documents back in november and i

1188
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,240
never got anything back it's it's

1189
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,160
possible that requesting them does work

1190
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,440
for

1191
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,040
some set of circumstances and i just

1192
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,119
didn't fit in them or possibly i i'm

1193
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,800
just in there spam traps for whatever

1194
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,839
other reason

1195
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,880
um but uh uh i think we should just

1196
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,200
treat it uh as a black box call it out

1197
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,200
in the in the last call as unavailable

1198
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,240
and leave it at that okay

1199
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,240
all right so

1200
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,160
oh uh

1201
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
richard

1202
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,800
uh just a quick idea that they're the

1203
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,880
iana registrations for these media

1204
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,280
published

1205
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,480
um i wonder if there's some action to

1206
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,280
take with diana here

1207
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,560
uh

1208
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,200
could you repeat that your your little

1209
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,040
uh broke up a little bit during here

1210
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,359
but to whom did you mean to

1211
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,560
addressing that question too sorry sorry

1212
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,400
yeah it knows me

1213
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,560
that again um

1214
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,800
so i'm a bit concerned about coming

1215
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,560
about specifications not being available

1216
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,960
given that diana registration these

1217
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,839
media types lists the specifications as

1218
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,079
published um now we can quibble that

1219
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,400
what it means to be published i think um

1220
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,240
being available to folks on the internet

1221
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,440
is is generally a definition people use

1222
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,280
but colin i think you might have

1223
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,839
insights

1224
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,760
here so i'm i'm not looking at the draft

1225
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,599
but i actually recommend i mean my

1226
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,319
understanding of let's ignore this draft

1227
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,920
event let's just talk about ipr

1228
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,200
declarations on these types of documents

1229
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,680
my understanding is that

1230
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,480
to

1231
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,920
discuss sending a media type over rtp

1232
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,079
you do not actually need a normative

1233
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,400
reference to the codec okay or any

1234
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,079
information inside of it

1235
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,240
um and that's very important for our ipr

1236
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,559
declarations in some ways um and that

1237
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,920
you can have an informational reference

1238
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,440
to it i don't even think this is a down

1239
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,960
raft and last call as long as it was

1240
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,480
informational reference i sent the

1241
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,680
suggestion to the list long ago that

1242
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,960
perhaps it should be an informational

1243
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,920
reference i don't know if that happened

1244
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,079
or not but exactly yes

1245
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,760
yeah so i mean like we're done it's not

1246
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,440
even a down ref

1247
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,760
yeah sorry i i didn't mean to to delay

1248
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,680
this document i just meant to note that

1249
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,599
um you know in in parallel to this

1250
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,200
discussion that there there might be an

1251
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,000
i in a question

1252
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,160
so again for the notes um

1253
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
i think the conclusion of this

1254
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,240
discussion is that the normative

1255
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,800
references to the skipped documents that

1256
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,400
are there at the moment

1257
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,720
which say something here's a reference

1258
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,960
and if you want to get the document

1259
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,280
talk to these people and ted did that

1260
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,880
and didn't get a reply for four months

1261
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
that these documents probably should

1262
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,359
just go into the informative reference i

1263
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,119
believe that's already been done

1264
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,800
is it yeah

1265
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,400
it has so

1266
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,920
that's it second yes

1267
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,079
second bullet on this slide okay good

1268
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,760
thank you so i don't need to note

1269
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,480
anything there

1270
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,800
okay

1271
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,599
uh ted hardy uh so i i think i have

1272
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,520
confused the matter by using the term

1273
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,359
downref and i apologize

1274
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,920
um i i did not mean to imply that this

1275
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,920
was exactly the same as a downrav i do

1276
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,559
think spec unavailability is a con is

1277
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:33,920
something that we need to call out i

1278
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,400
don't think it's blocking as as cullen

1279
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,440
pointed out

1280
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,400
uh

1281
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,680
this isn't something that we have to

1282
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,280
have but if the specs are in there and

1283
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,480
not available it's it's just polite to

1284
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,480
the community as we ask them to review

1285
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,079
it to let them know that they're likely

1286
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,480
not going to be available

1287
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,079
so that's basically just a note to the

1288
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,280
to the um

1289
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,040
whoever's doing this the write-up yeah

1290
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,319
that's the diagram trevor okay

1291
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,559
right well it's it's not that it's the

1292
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,480
specs are unavailable they're available

1293
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,400
on request if you will

1294
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,720
um again they're controlled by the

1295
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,240
by our nato skip fortune group so

1296
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,319
in most cases that i'm sure they'd be

1297
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,440
fine

1298
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,800
um

1299
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,920
if you reached out to them

1300
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,960
to request them

1301
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,720
they should be able to provide those to

1302
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,839
you

1303
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,160
uh teddy thank you for

1304
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,520
clarifying that but when i tried it

1305
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,200
didn't work so perhaps you could send to

1306
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,000
avt core exactly how to construct such a

1307
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,960
request because when i sent it to the

1308
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,200
um to the listed email address

1309
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,040
requesting the name of the document and

1310
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,040
explaining i wanted to review in the

1311
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,880
context of this document i got nothing

1312
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,760
back

1313
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,079
so i mean not even an uh thank you but

1314
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,640
no nothing so if you would like to give

1315
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,200
us the procedure for requesting it that

1316
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,880
would be a different way of handling

1317
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,280
this exact problem thanks

1318
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,960
okay we'll look into that thank you

1319
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,400
okay so um

1320
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,880
for our next step um do we

1321
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,720
it sounds like

1322
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,920
you know while you know there's some

1323
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,280
issues with

1324
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,160
you know

1325
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,680
people wanting the documents to review

1326
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,520
them it doesn't sound like there are any

1327
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,280
remaining open issues as far as i know

1328
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,319
so

1329
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:21,599
perhaps this is ready for working group

1330
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,720
last call bernard do you think so

1331
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,079
yes i do

1332
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,119
okay

1333
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,760
all right so yeah i think uh

1334
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,839
you know bernard and i will uh figure

1335
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,079
out who's gonna be the shepherd on that

1336
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,240
and uh let's we'll do the next step

1337
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,119
okay thank you

1338
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,800
okay

1339
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,119
thank you

1340
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,720
okay so bernard i guess are you

1341
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,160
presenting this next one uh yeah okay

1342
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,079
so this is uh

1343
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,079
a little update on rfc 7983 bis next

1344
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,400
slide

1345
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,720
so just to remind people what this is

1346
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,720
about it's an update to rfc 7983 section

1347
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,760
7

1348
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,559
documenting quick multiplexing

1349
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,400
so it's a description of how to

1350
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,520
multiplex srtp srtcp stun turn dtls crtp

1351
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,280
and quick

1352
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,119
and then also a little bit of guidance

1353
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,200
on handling overlap between quick and

1354
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,319
turn

1355
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,599
channels

1356
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,520
that's something that's not an issue in

1357
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,359
webrtc

1358
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,760
and it also updates the dtls content

1359
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,640
type field diana page to reference a new

1360
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,839
rc

1361
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,559
there's no other change needed so

1362
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,960
one caveat here is

1363
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,760
that this applies to quick version one

1364
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,480
it is not guaranteed to work

1365
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,000
in future versions of quick

1366
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,440
so next slide

1367
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:54,480
so

1368
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,880
the document has been updated in version

1369
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,240
o2

1370
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,480
so some some of the changes from version

1371
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,079
one um

1372
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,760
i did add some text about the

1373
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,400
multiplexing scenarios uh that this can

1374
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,839
be used for and they're really i think

1375
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,280
two main ones

1376
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,079
one is where we use quick primarily for

1377
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,119
data exchange and are continuing to use

1378
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,040
rtp and our tcp for the media with dtls

1379
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,599
srtp key management

1380
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,400
so

1381
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,760
and just to clarify some of the

1382
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,520
discussions we have this scenario

1383
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,440
doesn't require any replacement or

1384
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,520
changes to quick congestion control it's

1385
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,240
just using it as as data

1386
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,240
and so that's where you need the maximum

1387
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,559
multiplexing and the second scenario

1388
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,440
would be the rtp over quick scenario

1389
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,480
and that is where you're not using rtp

1390
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,000
and or tcp so you don't have to

1391
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,520
multiplex that but you still have to

1392
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,599
multiplex what's done and turn

1393
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,440
so the document covers both of these

1394
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,800
scenarios

1395
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,599
but

1396
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,440
the second one has less stringent

1397
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,640
requirements than than the first one

1398
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,559
so we clarified that the second thing is

1399
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,319
that um the

1400
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,240
many of the documents that this depended

1401
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,720
on have now reached our c status so

1402
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,559
we've had an update to stun an update to

1403
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,839
turn quick transport is now in rfc as is

1404
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:10,960
tls

1405
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,880
um so basically at this point all

1406
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,640
normative references are now published

1407
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,880
as rfcs there's no reference normative

1408
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,800
references to drafts

1409
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,280
um so question is are we ready for

1410
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,319
working group last call kind of where

1411
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,319
what do we need to do

1412
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,040
to move forward

1413
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,520
um

1414
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,119
yeah personally i would say it sounds

1415
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,839
like we are

1416
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,839
um seeing nodding in the room

1417
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,280
um so yeah it sounds like since

1418
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,720
bernard's an author on that probably i

1419
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,920
should

1420
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,280
call do a working group last call which

1421
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,200
i'll do

1422
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,000
uh sometime after where

1423
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,760
everybody's home and over there jet lag

1424
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,440
yeah that's true do it before magnus do

1425
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,079
you have something to say

1426
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,760
um bernard have you looked at what

1427
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,359
happens with quickv2

1428
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,879
uh well uh

1429
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,240
we have had discussions which is that uh

1430
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,760
in quick v2

1431
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,839
you know as it says here they're not

1432
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:22,559
required to be compatible with this

1433
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,559
um i mean that's kind of something that

1434
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,400
quick the quick working group has has

1435
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,599
said so

1436
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,640
i don't know that uh

1437
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,480
if you're asking whether it's

1438
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,720
specifically broken with quick v2 i

1439
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,440
think we'd have to do an analysis

1440
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,520
uh but do we know enough about quickv2

1441
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,720
to do that

1442
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,880
right now uh

1443
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,319
i would

1444
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,720
think so i mean my impression is quickv2

1445
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,760
is fairly a long quite along the way on

1446
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,720
the on the road to

1447
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,599
yeah

1448
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,119
so it it's

1449
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,400
i think you can definitely look and

1450
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,640
analyze it and

1451
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,839
see if what happens at least

1452
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,760
so okay procedurally my only question

1453
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,280
would be

1454
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,799
um do we want to have a normative

1455
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,200
reference on that if it's not coming for

1456
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,439
a while

1457
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,599
yeah but okay i would suggest just

1458
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,359
looking at it see what there and then

1459
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,640
follow up because

1460
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,720
it isn't that far off i think from

1461
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,400
actually making progress so it's um

1462
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,200
in quick working group it is quick v2 is

1463
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,880
the same as we won

1464
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,280
except it's flipping some

1465
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,160
some of the bits etc so it's basically

1466
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,440
creating some of this issue here

1467
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,000
etcetera but it's it's intended to have

1468
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,520
something to

1469
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,040
for quick to

1470
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,000
use to negotiate version negotiation etc

1471
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,799
and

1472
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,760
exercise some of these mechanisms

1473
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,920
so

1474
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,000
yeah yeah

1475
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,160
all right

1476
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,960
uh

1477
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,880
speaking yeah it's supposed to be

1478
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,160
completely compatible with v1 uh

1479
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,640
the the whole point of it is greasing

1480
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,720
to make sure that metal boxes don't

1481
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,599
start

1482
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:06,880
seeking for

1483
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,559
specific bit patterns that are only

1484
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,319
going to be part of b1

1485
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:11,119
so

1486
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,799
it should be very fast i mean i think

1487
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,400
we're we're not expecting it to take a

1488
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,680
year from now

1489
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,079
um so i think the point lucas made in

1490
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,400
the um

1491
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,160
uh in the chat is probably the right one

1492
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,160
that this should take into account uh

1493
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,000
the fact that that quick will grease

1494
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,760
some of these things and

1495
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,280
it will have multiple versions some of

1496
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,640
which will be

1497
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,280
uh compatible and some not but uh from

1498
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,000
the

1499
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,839
purposes of the multiplexing scenario

1500
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,160
that the critical bit is probably that

1501
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,440
the um

1502
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,799
the greasing will change the bid

1503
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,280
patterns

1504
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,920
well i mean there's all yeah we'll take

1505
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,839
a look at it but um you know we've had

1506
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,280
discussion with a quick working group

1507
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,200
that said that uh they weren't

1508
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,119
necessarily gonna commit to making

1509
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,319
version 2 compatible

1510
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,799
uh ted hardy speaking uh whether they

1511
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,640
committed it in the past it will be

1512
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,960
there's a link in the data in to the

1513
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,920
data tracker in in the uh

1514
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,160
in the chat that you can you can follow

1515
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,079
that this particular time

1516
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,880
what we're using v2 for is uh to grease

1517
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,240
these things and therefore it will be

1518
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,520
compatible

1519
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,759
oh okay

1520
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,558
okay uh come on

1521
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,119
all right so so like with v2 you mean

1522
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,160
martin dukes directly

1523
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,480
because if so it doesn't tell it

1524
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,839
um

1525
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,559
okay and uh let's and i'm actually in

1526
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,520
the mic

1527
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,440
line to really specifically for lucas i

1528
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,359
think lucas the actual issue of lucas

1529
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:03,680
was raising is this um draft which

1530
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,720
uh

1531
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,160
for somebody is they're greasing the

1532
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,400
quick bit specifically

1533
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,079
um if you look at the chat he's linked

1534
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,400
to the to the reference for that

1535
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,920
which i think

1536
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,599
i mean my suspicion would be that for

1537
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,480
7983 you have to say you're using that

1538
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,880
for demuxing so don't negotiate this

1539
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,480
extension if you're

1540
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,559
demuxing but i think we probably need to

1541
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,960
explicitly say that

1542
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,119
um yeah you could put that in the

1543
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,960
minutes that would be great

1544
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,520
yeah i mean the problem is um

1545
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,559
that

1546
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,000
uh one of the concerns of the quick

1547
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,480
working group was you know is this is

1548
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,240
this document an agreement that

1549
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,559
constrains them in some way and i think

1550
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,960
the general thought was no

1551
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,160
uh but um

1552
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,240
you know what one one could put in

1553
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,000
advice like that uh the question is

1554
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,680
whether that would uh create a normative

1555
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,920
reference on quickv2 so

1556
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,559
well i think similarly on gone quick

1557
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,119
quick uh quick bit grease which is

1558
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,040
hopefully

1559
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:05,920
okay

1560
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,720
just a bit grease yeah probably um but

1561
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,480
we should look at v2 didn't tell us to

1562
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,079
just until uh colin

1563
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,720
uh so i mean you know the purpose of

1564
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,160
greasing is to meet certain needs and

1565
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,839
you can go read the whole program edm

1566
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,000
program and everything else on it but it

1567
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
isn't just to try and make things broken

1568
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,680
in the internet right so i don't think

1569
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,880
they're going to do some piece of

1570
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,799
greasing that deliberately just breaks

1571
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,480
things that are happening so i think we

1572
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,000
could discuss with them but i think this

1573
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,440
whole point just raises the point that

1574
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,720
really we're going the wrong direction i

1575
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,640
think we ought to move it to a bcp

1576
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,079
and then it will constrain all the

1577
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,079
program calls um that do it and we

1578
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,720
should allocate a range of bits for each

1579
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,799
protocol and and say that that's how it

1580
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:45,520
is

1581
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,359
um across those protocols um and that

1582
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,040
would constrain them uh and we wouldn't

1583
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,799
be having this discussion so that's my

1584
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,720
two cents

1585
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,400
yeah my personal viewpoint is aligned

1586
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,839
with yours

1587
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,799
uh but uh it might be so that might be

1588
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,799
an appropriate thing to do

1589
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,760
but

1590
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,040
i'd like to hear what others think

1591
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,079
colin

1592
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,359
um

1593
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,160
my impression is that that may not be a

1594
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,520
good thing to do but i would be

1595
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,079
surprised if the quick quoting group

1596
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,400
would go along with it

1597
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,799
and i think perhaps a better guidance

1598
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,720
for this draft might be to say that this

1599
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,720
works with current versions of quick but

1600
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,319
be very clear that it's likely to break

1601
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,799
in the future

1602
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,680
what it says at the moment

1603
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,160
yeah and i mean presumably you know

1604
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,920
they're not going to

1605
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,960
be strengthened a little

1606
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,359
i mean quick and quick v1 presumably is

1607
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,440
not going away so you can keep using

1608
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,079
quickv1

1609
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,799
if that's what you need to use

1610
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,240
so i mean after all that i mean i guess

1611
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,839
it sounds like we do want to add that

1612
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,480
reference to the bit grease to say

1613
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,079
you know if you're demultiplexing don't

1614
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,920
negotiate it

1615
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,960
um so probably i'd suggest

1616
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,440
do a rev with that um take a look at v2

1617
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,799
see if there's anything that needs to be

1618
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,079
said

1619
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,359
see if we can maybe see if we can

1620
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,440
reference it as informative

1621
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,640
um information rather just to avoid too

1622
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,880
much in the way of

1623
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,839
uh of reference dependencies but

1624
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,039
we probably will need to normatively

1625
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,799
reference bit grease

1626
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,400
and they don't do this

1627
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,640
um

1628
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,880
and then i'd say working with less call

1629
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,880
after

1630
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,920
after we've got that uh anybody object

1631
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,160
to that

1632
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,119
yes if you can get that in a minute that

1633
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,599
would be great

1634
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,960
okay uh

1635
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,240
stephan nod so that sounds like we do

1636
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:52,000
all right i think that's it for this so

1637
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,680
next up is

1638
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,680
spencer

1639
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,520
okay looks like miracles are finding the

1640
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,520
camera so that's good

1641
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,119
thank you

1642
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,520
so i'm spencer dawkins talking about

1643
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,839
so many issues for

1644
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,319
sdp for rtp over quick

1645
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,559
next slide please

1646
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,440
so what i thought i was doing was

1647
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,000
basically sdp for a drop-in replacement

1648
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,359
for

1649
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,680
uh srtp

1650
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,319
uh since quick is encrypted and what i

1651
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:41,760
was actually doing

1652
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,119
was trying to keep track of questions

1653
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,000
about rtp over quick and about media

1654
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,359
over quick

1655
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,440
at some level

1656
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,760
because many of these questions might

1657
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,520
impact sdp

1658
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,680
at least and i was keeping those that

1659
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,359
list in at least three different places

1660
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,680
because of various reasons

1661
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,880
so

1662
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,799
what i have done

1663
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,079
was uh created a get a new github that

1664
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,079
combined all the issues from the various

1665
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,200
places

1666
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,240
where i had written things down

1667
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,920
and so i'm going to hold off on updating

1668
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,720
my individual draft for now

1669
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,520
but basically collect those

1670
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,839
questions

1671
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:27,920
as github issues and i've already seen

1672
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,200
someone

1673
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,839
uh attending the meeting from

1674
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,640
not here uh who was issu who put in at

1675
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,400
least one new issue

1676
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,640
about 2am my time so

1677
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,400
people are starting to do that

1678
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,720
and then i'll be working on answers and

1679
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,599
updating the sdp draft if i could uh get

1680
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,400
the next slide please

1681
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,599
so

1682
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,359
some of these may be

1683
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,280
issues maybe

1684
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,680
tied to non-traditional r2p

1685
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,799
use cases if if you think about it rtc

1686
01:04:58,799 --> 01:04:59,920
web

1687
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,160
webrtc by reference

1688
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,319
and the media of a quick buff that

1689
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,680
happened yesterday morning by reference

1690
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,359
but i'm tracking those issues

1691
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,680
i'm sorry two days ago it's later than i

1692
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,559
think

1693
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,799
um and um

1694
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:18,240
i'm tracking those issues anyway

1695
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,039
basically just in case

1696
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,119
we want to have

1697
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,079
rtp using quick like other media trans

1698
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,760
transport protocols do

1699
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,559
next slide please

1700
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,119
this is the slide that you also at the

1701
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,799
interim

1702
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:37,839
and i just wanted to say that there's

1703
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:41,119
three in there that are in italics uh

1704
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:45,440
five seven six and seven uh in the

1705
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,119
and these and these are actually still

1706
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,880
in the

1707
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,720
github for the draft because they were

1708
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,440
pretty clear and i know what to do

1709
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,280
but all the other numbers are new

1710
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,559
pointing to the issues um github

1711
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,359
next slide please

1712
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,760
i had new exciting

1713
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,280
issues from bernard and one of the

1714
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,640
places and

1715
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,200
wouldn't kind of talk about

1716
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,960
we could talk about any of these

1717
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,039
during the meeting that seemed helpful

1718
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,039
but

1719
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,960
uh just like i said i wanted to be sure

1720
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,200
that you all uh saw that that was

1721
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,880
happening because

1722
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,270
um

1723
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,440
[Music]

1724
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,240
my personal github isn't really tied to

1725
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,440
a btq or mailing list nor should it be

1726
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,640
and next slide please

1727
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,640
i had some issues

1728
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,400
that were in the i had several issues in

1729
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,920
the text of the sdp draft

1730
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,160
before i started putting in additional

1731
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,160
issues there

1732
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,319
most of those had actually ended up in

1733
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,559
the draft itself

1734
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:53,680
uh or sorry it ended up as issues in the

1735
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,160
in github itself but there were a couple

1736
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,960
of these that were not um

1737
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,839
the next slide please

1738
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,480
so i did have some uh

1739
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,039
some issues that i'd like feedback on

1740
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,520
either here or on the mailing list just

1741
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,480
fine

1742
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,760
and uh

1743
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,440
these three here um

1744
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,960
whether

1745
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,839
double encryption matters

1746
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:21,760
or

1747
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,520
distinguishing between mappings on the

1748
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,079
streams on the datagrams

1749
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,599
and

1750
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,599
quick connection management in case of

1751
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,200
path failure

1752
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,640
um

1753
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,640
next slide please

1754
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,799
this is why i would like for feedback

1755
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,960
from the group which was the initial

1756
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,960
draft defined to uh

1757
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,160
secure

1758
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,760
av profiles

1759
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,559
and that was a great plan

1760
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:49,520
because

1761
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,520
you could ignore

1762
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,119
the

1763
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,720
secure avp av protocol part of that

1764
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,559
going over quick

1765
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,880
um because it was encrypted

1766
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,000
then more stuff was encrypted than srt

1767
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,640
srtp would have encrypted anyway

1768
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,640
but to use that as a hint

1769
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,280
for middle boxes to forward

1770
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,160
over

1771
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,200
unencrypted protocols so if you hit

1772
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,479
rtp on the other side of a middle box

1773
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,158
the middle box would not have to guess

1774
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:23,279
whether you wanted it to be secure

1775
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,319
it could just it could just say

1776
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:27,600
you know

1777
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,399
it came in as savp so i'm going to send

1778
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,719
it out as savp over

1779
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,439
rtp over udp

1780
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:36,960
um

1781
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,960
and

1782
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,120
i got a comment that said this is silly

1783
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,719
and i believe them

1784
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:43,600
uh

1785
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,040
yeah basically just to find avp and uh

1786
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,759
ivpf and tell the truth

1787
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:50,880
uh

1788
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,359
again quick encrypts more than srtp

1789
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,479
anyway

1790
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,319
that we should be using explicit

1791
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,399
signaling to tell middle boxes how to

1792
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,359
forward

1793
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,839
uh things that they receive over rtp

1794
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,279
over quick

1795
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,120
and i implemented that as pr9 which is

1796
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,799
not

1797
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:11,839
merged in github because

1798
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,679
i got another comment after i did that

1799
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,158
that said not so fast what about apps

1800
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:18,080
that are using

1801
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,759
the secure av protocols uh av av

1802
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,040
profiles

1803
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,080
now

1804
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,600
and so that's kind of like i said that's

1805
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,439
kind of where that discussion is headed

1806
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,759
but rather than going back and forth

1807
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,040
every time i talk you know it's like

1808
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,640
changing the draft every time i talk to

1809
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,238
somebody

1810
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:36,080
that if i'm seeing if i'm seeing

1811
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,319
discussions that are

1812
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,120
have not converged yet um i think it's i

1813
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,960
think it's fair to ask the working group

1814
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,279
what the right thing to do is

1815
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:46,158
um

1816
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:48,238
colin i see colin perkins in the queue

1817
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,399
uh colin

1818
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,000
oh i said i should be

1819
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,238
i should turn slightly to face the uh

1820
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,440
cue

1821
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,960
hi colin

1822
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,719
hello i was mostly putting myself in the

1823
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:01,679
queue for you to finish

1824
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,679
so if you're not finished then carry on

1825
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,159
and finish oh i i i think the next slide

1826
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,800
is basically me me finishing and so you

1827
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,040
can so i can i can come to that one

1828
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,560
later and uh

1829
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,440
and we can talk now

1830
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,000
uh okay um

1831
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,920
i'm just reading your next slide here

1832
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,679
yeah um

1833
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,880
but i i think um

1834
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,280
i think the the point you're making uh

1835
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,400
with the double encryption and so on um

1836
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,719
thinks of hints at some of these issues

1837
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,520
i was going to raise which is that it's

1838
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,960
um

1839
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,360
i am increasingly unconvinced that it

1840
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,760
necessarily makes sense to run rtp over

1841
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,679
quick

1842
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:48,880
um

1843
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,520
i think it makes a lot of sense to run

1844
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,560
rt to use rtp payload formats and media

1845
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,480
types perhaps over quick

1846
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,360
sure

1847
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,440
but once you start looking at the rest

1848
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,800
of rtp you know the the the transport

1849
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,800
doesn't fit well the congestion control

1850
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,960
doesn't fit well the whole rtcp

1851
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,080
framework doesn't fit well um

1852
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,400
srtp doesn't fit well the sequence

1853
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,320
numbers the sslcs

1854
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,159
there's not a whole lot left of rtp

1855
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:17,520
other than the payload formats that

1856
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,040
makes sense

1857
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,920
um so i wonder if maybe that rather than

1858
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,080
trying to fit rtp over quick we should

1859
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,920
maybe be saying look this doesn't make

1860
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,239
sense but here are the bits that do make

1861
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,760
sense and maybe you need to define a

1862
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,320
different protocol that reuses payload

1863
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,080
formats for example over quick and then

1864
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,880
it's trivial to gateway

1865
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,679
thank you thank you colin

1866
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,239
thanks for the work uh i did respond to

1867
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,400
us a couple of issues on the github and

1868
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,239
and coming to the

1869
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,679
kind of i i

1870
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,520
called it away because uh while

1871
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,480
responding to it and that is the

1872
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,640
one that the profile started with

1873
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,360
feedback and having the rtcp there

1874
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,520
it is it is not very clear on how this

1875
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,560
also

1876
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,800
in the quick framework and at the same

1877
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,679
time um for the ones that working with a

1878
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,280
secure uh kind of thing where uh

1879
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,880
it's a hop by hawk between it went on

1880
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,480
the server and uh and and and uh the the

1881
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,239
srtp kind of

1882
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,080
kind of the encryption ends right there

1883
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,080
and their quick course already providing

1884
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:24,800
the

1885
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,520
the

1886
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,520
needed transport layer security right

1887
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,840
there and hence having the s

1888
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,800
did not make much uh was not adding more

1889
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,239
more security per say value

1890
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,120
so

1891
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,400
i i do feel uh if if we are taking some

1892
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,719
getting the rtp and sdp or tweak we need

1893
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:44,560
to kind of think about some of those

1894
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,080
points like colin mentioned like what

1895
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,560
are we trying to do it and

1896
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,440
sdp kind of naturally unfolds and how it

1897
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,360
gets used but but there's something we

1898
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,360
definitely have to think about a bit and

1899
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,199
uh and then we need to provide some

1900
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:00,239
guidance on what we need to do here

1901
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,320
thank you

1902
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,719
totally totally agree thank you

1903
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,360
uh bernard

1904
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,040
yeah um

1905
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,920
i would point out that uh as as we're

1906
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,080
hearing uh it is possible to experiment

1907
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,600
with a lot of this stuff

1908
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,080
um because we have some you know basic

1909
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,159
code and apis out there

1910
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,400
to actually build these systems

1911
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,239
um and in particular on the web it's a

1912
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,159
little bit constrained because we have

1913
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:29,600
web codecs which allows you to get the

1914
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,800
to encode and decode frames and then

1915
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,719
basically send them over

1916
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,320
either web transport or rtc data channel

1917
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,159
so you can actually build build some of

1918
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:41,600
this stuff

1919
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,960
and it is actually being done in

1920
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,640
commercial applications i would actually

1921
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,400
note that that um

1922
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,040
that this stuff is actually quite real

1923
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,040
at least at the moment it's mostly being

1924
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,360
done with containerized media but people

1925
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,040
want to get away from that

1926
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,199
uh because it's basically uh if you

1927
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,800
don't need content protection it's just

1928
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,600
a bunch of overhead so people want a way

1929
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,560
of of transporting these frames and

1930
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,159
what i've seen so far is that they have

1931
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:08,719
been using something pretty close to rt

1932
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:09,920
rtp

1933
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,679
so you know a lot of the fields are

1934
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:12,960
there

1935
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,960
the rtcp is usually done quite

1936
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,080
differently

1937
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,159
um but but uh

1938
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,000
in practice i guess to what colin is

1939
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,960
saying many parts of it are taken out

1940
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,120
but you do need kind of sequence numbers

1941
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,760
and time stamps and stuff like that and

1942
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,440
you know uh and things like that

1943
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,840
someone in the room just flinched i are

1944
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,840
yeah

1945
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,960
so magnus westland uh yeah

1946
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,280
i mean on the higher level saying here i

1947
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,520
think the only reason for having double

1948
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,679
encryption is if you have a middle box

1949
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,800
that are forwarding it without changing

1950
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,239
anything so if you have ekt for example

1951
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,520
and try to do not touched really at all

1952
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,600
the the key just forwarding the packets

1953
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,280
that's i think is the only one which

1954
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,199
would be and that i think in that case

1955
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:06,320
you should negotiate savpf otherwise if

1956
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,840
you're not encrypting the internal just

1957
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,120
send it to save ps if you're going to

1958
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,960
have rtp directly on quick but i mean

1959
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,280
this is back to you i think your written

1960
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,159
question is what the hell is rtp work we

1961
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:17,600
just you need to answer that question

1962
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,800
first or what's these things it might be

1963
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,280
several answers i i may be i may be

1964
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,440
changing the title on an issue in the in

1965
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,640
the uh

1966
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,480
in the issue tracker

1967
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,760
what the hell is um yeah yes

1968
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,400
so cool thank you thank you magnus

1969
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,199
uh and cullen

1970
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:42,719
so partially i really resonate with call

1971
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,600
and i i think this is a this is a a a

1972
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,679
very challenging path that's not clear

1973
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:50,480
the value of the end goal of but i think

1974
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,000
we sailed past that bridge we agreed to

1975
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,600
do this long ago so at this point i want

1976
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,040
to help you figure out how to get it

1977
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,719
done not just tell you you shouldn't do

1978
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:57,920
it and thank you i'm sending you big

1979
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,440
hugs for having to put this on it's not

1980
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,560
easy um but that's that back up

1981
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,280
i think your easiest path here is though

1982
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,199
it sounds silly to do double encryption

1983
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:08,480
and actually if you were doing it over

1984
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,640
an http turn connection that did you

1985
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,520
know https would be triple encryption

1986
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,880
um i think you should just do that

1987
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,640
that's what it signaled it's the easiest

1988
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,159
to understand it's going to be by far

1989
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,760
the easiest to do and there's multiple

1990
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,360
cases where you actually might want this

1991
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,440
there's lots of people who there's more

1992
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,440
in defense sort of type environments who

1993
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,880
like the idea of double encryption

1994
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,560
because if one of them is compromised

1995
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,679
hopefully the other one might be

1996
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,280
different like you might use rsa and one

1997
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,520
in ec in the outer or whatever there are

1998
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,640
times where you can improve your

1999
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,719
security by doing it twice there's also

2000
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,480
some cisco makes some products where we

2001
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,880
um do what we call throwaway encryption

2002
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,040
where the outer layer is tls encrypted

2003
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,480
but we know that the middle box is the

2004
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,840
man in the middle of that tls so we

2005
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,360
encrypt the stuff inside that again

2006
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,520
again in a way they can't decrypt so i

2007
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,120
like look

2008
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,360
it's it's not unimaginable that there

2009
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,760
are use cases for double encryption it's

2010
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,560
it's

2011
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,320
semantically what everything means and

2012
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,520
you're gonna have a very hard time

2013
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,280
redefining everything to semantically

2014
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,960
mean not double encryption in this case

2015
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,560
over quick so i wouldn't do it i just

2016
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,840
like if people signal that they get

2017
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,880
double encryption that's what they asked

2018
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,560
for have a nice day

2019
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,400
cool and i and so i can uh update i can

2020
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,520
update the

2021
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,560
uh issue to explain that and that's

2022
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,679
probably adding things in uh security

2023
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,120
considerations

2024
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,600
in the actual sdp draft and things like

2025
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,679
that so cool thank you

2026
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,120
and i mean i think i'd say like this

2027
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,120
might seem silly but

2028
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,440
trust me the alternative is

2029
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,480
not we're a path we're going to go down

2030
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,640
well silly for me is wandering back and

2031
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,080
forth between

2032
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,400
uh allow between registering it and not

2033
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,920
registering it

2034
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,760
you know with a cycle time of one atf

2035
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,000
um let's have a look

2036
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,600
so maybe stefan wenger maybe it's time

2037
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,280
to

2038
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,239
have a fresh look at the rtp spec

2039
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:57,520
and

2040
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,480
write up a short document that says what

2041
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,520
of this stuff actually makes

2042
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,800
sense

2043
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,080
uh when your only purpose is

2044
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,120
to

2045
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,800
put some framing into the into the

2046
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,760
datagrams that that are offered by quick

2047
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,960
right what makes sense and

2048
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,040
you can ignore the following sections

2049
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,199
and then comes a long list starting with

2050
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,840
congestion control and good riddance to

2051
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,920
that as you all know from my viewpoint

2052
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,640
so

2053
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,520
so

2054
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,640
and

2055
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,560
the same thing potentially with the with

2056
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,360
the payload formats right there's also

2057
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,800
potentially

2058
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,800
areas in there that that don't make

2059
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,159
sense and the same thing also

2060
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:41,840
potentially for the

2061
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,640
uh for the um srtp

2062
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,600
and the the the security profiles

2063
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,080
so maybe maybe it makes sense to to

2064
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,320
start there and

2065
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,719
create this rtp light that i wanted to

2066
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,400
have you know throw away all this

2067
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,920
multicast support right

2068
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,880
yeah um i wanted to do that 20 years ago

2069
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,120
um

2070
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,080
maybe it's time to do just that thank

2071
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:08,880
you

2072
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,640
thank you stefan

2073
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,679
see

2074
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,840
uh mal

2075
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,159
those and eddie one final point on the

2076
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:19,760
uh srtp uh the savpf thing

2077
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,159
uh regardless of the protocol and the

2078
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,640
need implementation wise it actually may

2079
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,199
be easier to always go

2080
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:29,360
with a library that's tightly bound with

2081
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,920
rtp and srtp because almost everybody is

2082
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,520
going to have that already it may be

2083
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,679
actually more work to unbind them and

2084
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,000
figure out how to how to wedge in

2085
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,920
your own extraction of just the rtp

2086
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,880
layer

2087
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,120
um and put srtp much later somewhere

2088
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,280
else

2089
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,159
yeah thank you and thank you mo uh if

2090
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,840
i'm going to call on james in just a

2091
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,960
second but the uh i did want to say

2092
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,360
there is architectural work to be done

2093
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,120
here um

2094
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,719
and so

2095
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,120
trying to think about this

2096
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,159
one

2097
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:04,719
protocol at a time when you're

2098
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,320
relying on

2099
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,800
quick and you're relying on

2100
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,000
let's say

2101
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
uh

2102
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,600
armchat or

2103
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,199
maybe even asking for help

2104
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:17,600
i from

2105
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,679
crg and things like that that there

2106
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,600
actually is some architectural work to

2107
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,320
do there whether that ends up in any in

2108
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,719
any document or not

2109
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:27,920
james

2110
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,840
oh thank you spencer for working on this

2111
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,520
um i see a huge amount of value in our

2112
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,480
maybe even making in a more generic way

2113
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,800
or the payload formats that doesn't mean

2114
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,840
we need to go through and

2115
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,560
retroactively

2116
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,880
handle all the payload formats that have

2117
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,560
ever existed

2118
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,560
uh but definitely a way to decouple rtp

2119
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,520
uh payload formats from rtp itself so

2120
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,159
that it could be used in other transport

2121
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:01,360
protocols in the future would be very

2122
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,920
interesting and i think would add an

2123
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,520
awful lot of value to uh this work and

2124
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,639
like

2125
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,199
elsewhere

2126
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,639
cool thank uh thank you i think i'm

2127
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,120
hearing a suggestion

2128
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,120
not necessarily just from james from

2129
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,480
these questions

2130
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,159
about whether you know whether we're

2131
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,400
talking about uh a

2132
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,480
document like the one that stefan

2133
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,719
described which basically profiles and

2134
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:29,520
says

2135
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,159
um if you're doing this over quick

2136
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,280
um

2137
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,560
here's what you you know here's what you

2138
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,080
should do here's what you should get

2139
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,920
from someplace else

2140
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,080
um and things like that because you know

2141
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,440
i've got other

2142
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,480
issues uh about am i doing feedback from

2143
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,639
rtcp from

2144
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,880
uh quick or from something that's not

2145
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,120
either one of those or for both

2146
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,719
uh i don't think i don't think i've

2147
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,280
listed that possibility so uh yeah um

2148
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,120
this has been very helpful and i feel

2149
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,120
good about only putting up a slide for

2150
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,199
one issue thank you

2151
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:05,600
how close am i to being over time um

2152
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,800
rather but we have lots of time it's

2153
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,320
okay oh

2154
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,639
i mean i've only got one slide okay you

2155
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,400
put up the what happens next yeah okay

2156
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,639
yeah so you do what happens next

2157
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,080
yeah um

2158
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,320
is this a um you're telling me i should

2159
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,840
have done two slides

2160
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,040
okay yeah

2161
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,320
um

2162
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,440
but um

2163
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,760
i'm going to hold like i say as i said

2164
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,040
previously

2165
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,560
uh collecting answers and um

2166
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,320
collecting questions from at various

2167
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,400
places and then working on answers to

2168
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,800
the questions and updating the sdp draft

2169
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,880
it sounds like

2170
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,239
either what i or other people or i and

2171
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,960
other people would be doing would be

2172
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,960
starting to think about the

2173
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,280
pro the rtp profile

2174
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,520
for rtp over quick

2175
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,840
um

2176
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,560
did i get that wrong

2177
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,040
no hi steph i i i stopped wondering we

2178
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,080
we have actually an i think

2179
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,719
a reasonably mature thing they're from

2180
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,760
from york and and his his student over

2181
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,679
there right um for rtp over quick

2182
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,600
that thing

2183
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,760
that thing describes what's on the wire

2184
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,920
right it should probably add a little

2185
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,239
bit a few section

2186
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:25,840
um the following parts of the of rfc

2187
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,960
3550 are irrelevant don't read them

2188
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,239
ignore them

2189
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,320
if your library has them comment them

2190
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,480
out and then comes the long list and

2191
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,639
then we're already done

2192
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,040
i think maybe that's

2193
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,560
i don't know what what is going on with

2194
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,000
that draft

2195
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,520
um they didn't have anything to say

2196
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,199
about it at this cycle but i think they

2197
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:47,440
said they'd hope to have something

2198
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,920
again by the next one so yeah we yeah

2199
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,440
well i have to talk to you about that

2200
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,880
what you're

2201
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,080
said in the chat that it's active so

2202
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,159
yeah what i would what i what i thought

2203
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,800
was going on was basically that they had

2204
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,880
done their version one or version

2205
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,800
whatever it is of their draft it had

2206
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,360
been focused more on the performance you

2207
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,280
know and performance results of running

2208
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,639
over quick

2209
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:11,920
with two different congestion

2210
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,440
controllers active

2211
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,600
and so i think they've been focused on

2212
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,600
that at least some of our time

2213
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,120
they are academics they have to write

2214
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,360
papers and

2215
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,719
so

2216
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:23,679
yeah

2217
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:27,199
but still i think i think

2218
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,600
i think rather than having yet another

2219
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,360
draft that ultimately will have to be

2220
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,440
merged into it i think we should just

2221
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,040
talk to you or get some point and see

2222
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,880
whether we can do something there

2223
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,120
cool all right uh bernard

2224
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,880
hello um just had one comment which is

2225
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,880
that i think york's draft is focused on

2226
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,480
quick datagrams

2227
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,960
uh most of what i'm seeing out there in

2228
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,760
the wild is actually using a

2229
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,480
quick stream per message

2230
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,239
so that they are avoiding their knack

2231
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,719
mechanism

2232
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,760
so that that is one thing that is

2233
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,239
not covered by that breath

2234
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:07,440
and and

2235
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,600
the sense that i have from talking to

2236
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,960
people

2237
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,360
here and in previous versions of places

2238
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,400
like here

2239
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,960
is that there are reasons to do

2240
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,639
streams and there are reasons to do

2241
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:20,480
datagrams and

2242
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,560
um it's not like we have to fight over

2243
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,239
which one to put in we just have to

2244
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,639
describe both of them

2245
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,320
right jumping don't want to jump the

2246
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,440
cube but it's actually it's actually a

2247
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,360
very good reason to do both in the same

2248
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,080
system right whenever you have layering

2249
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,239
you want datagrams for the enhancement

2250
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:39,440
layers and

2251
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,760
possible the stream for the base

2252
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,920
cool

2253
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,120
sounds like we're getting closer to

2254
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,719
doing the right thing that always makes

2255
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,320
me happy hope so

2256
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,840
anybody else

2257
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,920
i don't so

2258
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:52,880
just that

2259
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,639
um

2260
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,239
george just comments in the chat that

2261
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,159
his draft is active and

2262
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,679
when you said that he's just only doing

2263
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:01,600
datagrams and not streams he said not

2264
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,800
yet smiley so

2265
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,239
so it sounds like york is continuing to

2266
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,920
work on his drafts so that's good

2267
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,840
excellent excellent going forward we'll

2268
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,080
have more to talk about excellent

2269
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,040
um

2270
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,440
thank you and i think that

2271
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,040
i think that's everything that i know on

2272
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,400
friday morning

2273
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,840
thank you all for your

2274
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,239
help all right next up is cullen with

2275
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,799
game moves

2276
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:30,960
okay

2277
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,239
wow i didn't realize we're out when

2278
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:34,719
already okay um so what i'm going to

2279
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,719
talk a little bit about here is taking

2280
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,080
and i'm getting quite a bit of feedback

2281
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,120
from the room i don't know if there's a

2282
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,480
way to reduce the mic gain or something

2283
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,360
but

2284
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,400
uh

2285
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,560
i'm going to be talking about the idea

2286
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,000
of taking some data around uh game moves

2287
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,440
in game state and putting them into rtp

2288
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,320
so next slide please

2289
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,840
um

2290
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,440
does that help does that help on the

2291
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,560
feedback i think

2292
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,239
i think my um

2293
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,400
medical client had hadn't gotten unmuted

2294
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,480
i hadn't gotten them unmuted so okay

2295
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,920
it's better now

2296
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,679
i'll keep talking yeah it's way better

2297
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:12,000
thank you so sorry um

2298
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,400
no no worries at all okay so uh goals

2299
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,679
here is

2300
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,440
more and more we're getting large

2301
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,719
systems where people are doing these

2302
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,639
multiplayer games or applications like

2303
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:22,719
metaverse type things here some of these

2304
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:24,480
other systems where you're trying to

2305
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,639
take the state of game objects or the

2306
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,440
state of user interface things and

2307
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,760
circulate them over over various things

2308
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,000
obviously uh low latency is critical to

2309
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,639
this uh large scale is you know scale

2310
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,480
out is critical in some applications not

2311
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,600
others

2312
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,159
uh and there's many cases where you do

2313
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:43,760
want to synchronize it with other audio

2314
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,199
or video that might have to do with the

2315
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:48,000
application or the game uh there are

2316
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,679
some frameworks for doing this out there

2317
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:51,600
there's unity's udp there's nvidia's

2318
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,600
omniverse there's there's others around

2319
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,120
that you can be used with third-party

2320
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,360
service but when we do measurements of

2321
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,239
those

2322
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:00,639
uh they're they're often uh have

2323
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,560
latencies higher in fact than than the

2324
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,719
better rtp conferencing systems that we

2325
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,239
see out there that have you know

2326
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,080
well-designed backbones multiple pops

2327
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,360
around the world those types of things

2328
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,600
so next time

2329
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,280
so the specific use case that i'm

2330
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,400
concerned about

2331
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,719
and driving this for is

2332
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,000
this thing called webex hologram i'm not

2333
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,040
going to talk about it much but we're

2334
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,400
displaying a hologram and a user

2335
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,600
interface conference and people are

2336
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,000
manipulating 3d objects and we need to

2337
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,520
pick those up and grab them and move

2338
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,960
them around but lots of other people

2339
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,639
have other use cases and this is a very

2340
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,320
similar use case

2341
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,199
to

2342
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:32,719
um what we're seeing with a bunch of

2343
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:34,880
people are doing three-day 3-d meetings

2344
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,679
with avatars of various forms

2345
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:40,800
uh next step

2346
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,719
so

2347
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:44,480
a classical piece of data that you want

2348
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,719
to use from this is you might think well

2349
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:48,000
there's nothing in common between these

2350
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,360
different apps but it turns out there is

2351
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,880
an incredible amount of comment there's

2352
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,239
an incredible number of things where all

2353
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,480
you want to do is give the location a

2354
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,239
particular time and velocity for net

2355
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:58,560
code type usages of a given object

2356
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,800
there's also things like a hand so tons

2357
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,080
of these ar vr systems come up with

2358
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,600
you know a hand controller in them and

2359
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,280
microsoft makes this mixed reality

2360
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,880
toolkit that's used in tons of the

2361
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,320
headsets not just microsoft's but

2362
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,159
everybody's headsets it's a very popular

2363
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:14,639
open source library and it encodes the

2364
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,239
join angles in the hands and even people

2365
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:17,920
who don't use this library end up

2366
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,840
inevitably encoding the joint angles in

2367
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,000
the hands which are more or less fixed

2368
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,120
by

2369
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,480
the autonomy the

2370
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,480
anatomy the bones in our hands

2371
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,920
so you know that's a common thing for

2372
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,760
example and

2373
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,520
so what we're proposing here is like one

2374
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,199
of the the objects that you can send

2375
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,840
inside these rtp packets is

2376
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,120
the the the geometry of your hand bones

2377
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,560
and the rate of change of them so you

2378
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,080
can send them to the far side the far

2379
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,760
side can chill the hand can show can

2380
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,480
interpolate the hand forward in

2381
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,159
in motion in time a little bit so you

2382
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,000
don't have to send these instantly so

2383
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,600
you have some delay and some of the

2384
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,639
other side next slide

2385
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,199
okay so what the solution looks like is

2386
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:03,760
um yeah you know this is a schema based

2387
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,920
encoding uh where you know the scheme

2388
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,760
ahead of time it's not like something

2389
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,120
like json where you can pull it out all

2390
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,400
the things because you generally you

2391
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,679
only use it in ways where you know what

2392
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,080
the objects are and understand them it's

2393
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,840
extensible with tagline values it's

2394
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,520
binary encoded

2395
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,360
it's very much designed to allow people

2396
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,440
to make it easily extensible

2397
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,199
to build their own objects and register

2398
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:25,040
them and use them for whatever use cases

2399
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,159
they have

2400
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,639
and it's also

2401
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:30,880
uh

2402
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,719
it's really hard to keep your training

2403
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,080
plot when you're hearing yourself talk

2404
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,840
with the echo of my apologies um

2405
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,159
you know it's it's pretty much a cut

2406
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:42,239
yeah i saw that thanks

2407
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,719
um so that's the general form of the

2408
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:46,840
solution next

2409
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,800
slide uh

2410
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,880
the current draft

2411
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,560
look it needs a i mean

2412
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,320
i wrote this draft to give you enough of

2413
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,000
a flavor to understand what it is you

2414
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,600
could probably implement it from this

2415
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,199
there's lots of the normal stuff that

2416
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,280
you need as you know the framework

2417
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,719
templates for fully specifying you know

2418
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:06,639
for all the diana registry stuff that's

2419
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:08,639
all missing but you know how we do that

2420
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:11,280
okay i mean the gist of what this

2421
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,040
structure would really be

2422
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,040
is is largely in there there's an open

2423
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,639
source implementation people can go play

2424
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,400
with they want we have some people using

2425
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,400
this it's you know it's it's still very

2426
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,320
early stage that's where where it is

2427
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,840
today and my last slide

2428
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,000
so

2429
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,320
what i you know i would like to move

2430
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,960
this forward uh somewhere and i need to

2431
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,679
move it forward relatively quickly this

2432
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:37,280
isn't a five-year plan i mean there's a

2433
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:38,639
lot of people trying to work on how they

2434
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,400
can standardize various things and make

2435
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,400
things interoperable between

2436
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,320
various versions of somebody might be on

2437
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,880
metaverse or games or all these things

2438
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:47,840
uh

2439
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,600
if this is the right place to do it it's

2440
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,679
great i don't think it slows down in any

2441
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,920
way any other ongoing work going on this

2442
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,360
working group or anything like this is

2443
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,960
probably largely a slightly different

2444
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,800
set of people they're interested in it

2445
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,199
but does take some expertise in

2446
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,040
the review of how this fits on top of

2447
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,440
rtp and all of those types of things

2448
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:08,719
um so i don't want to be you know here a

2449
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:10,400
year from now still asking whether this

2450
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,080
is the right place to do it i'd rather

2451
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,520
just get a

2452
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,679
you know if you think this is if you

2453
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:17,280
really wish this would go away and never

2454
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,360
come back please tell me

2455
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,960
if we want to do it please tell me i

2456
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,639
don't even care i just want to have a

2457
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:24,560
concrete way to move forward

2458
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,400
um so with that let me stop taking any

2459
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,320
questions about about it and then about

2460
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,600
what we should do with it and how we

2461
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,520
should go forward from here thanks so um

2462
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,639
stephanie looks like you're first on

2463
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,080
thecube

2464
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,920
stefan wenger uh are you aware what's

2465
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,600
going on in mpeg with the haptic stuff

2466
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,000
yeah yeah i've been watching that uh a

2467
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,239
little bit it it seems uh

2468
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,560
somewhat related but i may not know

2469
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,400
enough about it maybe some of that

2470
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,159
interface with this i think some of that

2471
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:51,679
is quite different and it's really

2472
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:54,400
focused on the input of controllers more

2473
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,360
than the state of objects in a game uh

2474
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,719
where there might be multiple different

2475
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,000
ones with all different with a

2476
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,080
completely different list of factors in

2477
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,400
it but it's it's definitely related

2478
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,280
yeah

2479
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,920
um so my my general observation is that

2480
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,159
uh

2481
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,239
while the idf had isolated examples

2482
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:19,120
where it did good work on

2483
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,450
what i would call a codec

2484
01:33:21,450 --> 01:33:22,560
[Music]

2485
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,480
it also had

2486
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,800
examples where they didn't do good work

2487
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:27,600
there

2488
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,040
and

2489
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,400
this looks

2490
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,800
at least in part a little bit like a

2491
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,719
codec or representation there's also

2492
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,719
stuff going on over

2493
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:37,920
uh

2494
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,800
in

2495
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,960
what these graphics guys uh what what

2496
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,840
are they called um

2497
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,679
but it will come back in in in a second

2498
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:49,199
you know where intel and nvidia and

2499
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:52,080
those guys hang out and play

2500
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,400
so so there is there are activities

2501
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,480
going on in this field this is not

2502
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,480
classic protocol design

2503
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,638
so

2504
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,639
i mean it's pretty classic protocol

2505
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:03,920
design i mean it's certainly going on

2506
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,600
lots of different places but i mean and

2507
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,480
it is definitely a codec for game state

2508
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,719
no question about it right so so so

2509
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:12,480
think about whether

2510
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,520
whether

2511
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,440
whether you want to go into a protocol

2512
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,520
group with it with such a project or

2513
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,960
rather go somewhere else with it

2514
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,600
i am

2515
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,360
so us

2516
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,159
um

2517
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,000
i i i'm coming from an implementation

2518
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,880
experience uh on this one and trying to

2519
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,440
see why

2520
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,280
something like the rtp would make sense

2521
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,840
and trying to provide an explanation if

2522
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,440
it does not make sense i'm happy with

2523
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,719
that but

2524
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:41,840
one thing

2525
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,360
what i've seen we've seen is that

2526
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:48,560
most of these game moves are need to get

2527
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,000
they tie very closely in terms of

2528
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,679
synchronization with the audio and video

2529
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:54,400
that's happening um uh as part of the

2530
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,320
game or as part of the like you know

2531
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,199
then the omnibus kind of multiverse kind

2532
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:01,600
of things and and rtp kind of provides

2533
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,440
that time synchronization point across

2534
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,639
multiple streams that's happening

2535
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:05,760
naturally

2536
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,639
and having uh this uh all along the

2537
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,719
plane along the same lines of audio and

2538
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:11,679
video

2539
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,840
as another data stream would uh

2540
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,000
naturally fit in there and that that

2541
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,080
might be one reason i why i would think

2542
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,280
it's in the scope of 50 core uh

2543
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,880
but i think it's a for the group to

2544
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,400
decide but that would be my

2545
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:29,320
consideration my view on this one

2546
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,639
sergio

2547
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:35,920
hi hello

2548
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,280
so i definitely think that

2549
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,159
having this kind of podcast specifies is

2550
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:45,280
a good thing i mean i'm completely

2551
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,560
okay with

2552
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,560
trying to move this forward but i'm not

2553
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,800
sure if if this should be something that

2554
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,679
is carried over rtp or if we could do it

2555
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,600
in in data channels

2556
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,480
because

2557
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:59,119
for example if you are then

2558
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:01,840
integrated into webrtc it will

2559
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,560
require us to expose a lot of apis for

2560
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,360
all the different protocols in in the

2561
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,400
in the browser's api in order to use it

2562
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,560
so i'm not sure if you have a

2563
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,000
thought of

2564
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,040
define it something that it is data data

2565
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,960
channel based for example similar to

2566
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,600
what the

2567
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:24,080
t140 has done to specify the t140 over

2568
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,920
data channels

2569
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,280
because for example this is something

2570
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,119
that i have been also considering to do

2571
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:32,400
a for sending live customize with the

2572
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,800
web bt over data channels

2573
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,639
obviously there is the issue about how

2574
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:38,880
to synchronize the and the data channels

2575
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,040
and the rtp

2576
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,560
and the rtp data

2577
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,040
but i think that if we could

2578
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,440
or some of this is

2579
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,320
information is is a

2580
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,480
we need to to it has to be in real time

2581
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,600
and not

2582
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,520
or for example game moves they don't

2583
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,199
have to be synchronized with the video

2584
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,679
because they have to be processed

2585
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:01,280
and consume as

2586
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,520
as soon as they are received they don't

2587
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,520
really require much synchronization with

2588
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06,480
the

2589
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,080
with the video

2590
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,520
and and

2591
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,920
but obviously it's just thinking about

2592
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,199
the if

2593
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:15,280
what do you think about sending this in

2594
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,040
data channel instead of

2595
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,719
of rtp but

2596
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:20,719
the idea of having something specified

2597
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:21,679
for these

2598
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:25,679
spaces is is a very good idea

2599
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,840
i mean i i had thought a little bit

2600
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,760
about the issue of how this maps into

2601
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,920
browsers and i actually hadn't been like

2602
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,280
okay well this will probably gateway

2603
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,840
over data channels or whatever however

2604
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,960
we do rtp over web transports type thing

2605
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,639
was was my thinking

2606
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:41,360
but

2607
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:44,000
the problem uh the problem with just

2608
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,040
directly using data channels is that

2609
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,800
most of large

2610
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,639
distribution systems that scale out

2611
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,080
these whole networks that give you the

2612
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,840
whole latency like a low latency

2613
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,639
worldwide they're they're not the most

2614
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:58,320
of them are not using

2615
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,560
uh webrtc around it they're gatewaying

2616
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,600
from webrtc to classic rtp moving it

2617
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,800
around in rtp and then maybe it's webrtc

2618
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,719
out the far end again so you know i mean

2619
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:11,280
that'd be true of you know webex zoom

2620
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,280
microsoft teams you know list goes on

2621
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,560
and i realize there's ones that aren't

2622
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,280
like that but so that wasn't a really

2623
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,119
very good deployability option just

2624
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,639
because the build out of the rtp

2625
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:21,840
architecture i wanted to be able to

2626
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,679
leverage that i couldn't leverage that

2627
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,560
if i put it over data channels

2628
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,560
um though i definitely was concerned

2629
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,400
about like well how does what what does

2630
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,080
this mean for a client running on a

2631
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,080
browser though

2632
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,880
many of the um

2633
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,480
you know mini browser input many things

2634
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,320
that run on a browser the implement you

2635
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,520
know an implementation of a game that

2636
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,119
runs on a browser that you can join from

2637
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:44,719
a browser and you can join another way

2638
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,560
probably have gatewaying of different

2639
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,239
protocols in the back anyway so i

2640
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:49,440
imagine that probably wouldn't be that

2641
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,760
big a deal but that sort of you know my

2642
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,199
thought was a combination between that

2643
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:56,839
and and web transport

2644
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,400
um all right donald trump's

2645
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,800
um i guess mostly as an individual i

2646
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,360
feel like um this group

2647
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,199
we have the expertise to do things like

2648
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,280
okay this is how you get it there

2649
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,960
you know you know reliably and

2650
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,440
synchronized with audio and video and

2651
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,880
you know all that good stuff i don't

2652
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,239
feel like we have a lot of expertise in

2653
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:17,360
knowing these are the correct this is

2654
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,480
the correct

2655
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,280
description of the object state and the

2656
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,040
game moves and all that and so my

2657
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,840
inclination would be to

2658
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,679
say um i mean if there's another venue

2659
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:28,560
that

2660
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,000
can say this is the information we want

2661
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,080
to send and then this group would say

2662
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,760
this is how you send it

2663
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,679
sort of very much in the classic codec

2664
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:38,239
versus payload format split

2665
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:40,880
that would probably probably be the

2666
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,159
cleanest

2667
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:43,920
you know the sort of the best

2668
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:44,880
um

2669
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,040
use of this group's expertise i like i

2670
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,719
said i don't feel like we i mean if you

2671
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:50,159
can get people to have that expertise

2672
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:51,679
and have them come here

2673
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:53,920
i guess it's as good as anything else

2674
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,280
we could provide a forum but i don't

2675
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,360
really feel like this is

2676
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,040
our classic expertise so if there were

2677
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,800
somewhere else that could give that you

2678
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,280
know the could define the kodak if you

2679
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,159
will

2680
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,920
that would probably

2681
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,679
that would make me more comfortable but

2682
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:09,119
if that doesn't exist we probably could

2683
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:11,679
provide a forum if we had to

2684
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:12,960
so um

2685
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,159
so john i'm going to reply to this a

2686
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:16,400
little bit i at some level 100 agree

2687
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:19,199
with you right but just to follow how

2688
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:20,719
it's what it's like to bring new work to

2689
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:23,119
the itf of course right i request a time

2690
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:25,440
in the dispatch working group to talk

2691
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,679
about that issue and see if where we

2692
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,600
should dispatch this kodak work and

2693
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,719
they're like no we're not even going to

2694
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:32,080
give you agenda time this is in the

2695
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,159
scope of abt core and it's like okay

2696
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:35,600
that doesn't quite make sense but okay

2697
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,360
but the reality is there's nowhere at

2698
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,639
ietf that is does have that and we have

2699
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:42,719
as good a lock bringing it to a group

2700
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:44,080
that happens to have an email list

2701
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,639
called avt as any other email list like

2702
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:47,920
like you know what we're going to be

2703
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:48,960
able to do to bring that in or out

2704
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,280
doesn't doesn't change in any way

2705
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:52,159
um

2706
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:54,239
so i mean i hear you i don't know what

2707
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:55,360
to do

2708
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,199
but i feel a little bit like you know

2709
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:58,880
bring me a rock is the standard answer

2710
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:01,199
at itf

2711
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:02,840
yeah i mean i

2712
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,840
think yeah i mean so bro

2713
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,280
rowan's comment is if you can get the

2714
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,280
domain experts here who know this stuff

2715
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,800
and they can do good review then i guess

2716
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,880
we can do it but um

2717
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,719
i want to make sure that i i don't i i

2718
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:16,080
don't i personally would not have the

2719
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,920
expertise to know whether what we're

2720
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,920
doing whether the descriptions of game

2721
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,520
moves is correct or not so yeah yeah no

2722
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,960
um mo

2723
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,080
uh mozinati i i agree with uh with

2724
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,520
stefan and jonathan that there

2725
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,520
definitely needs to be a split between

2726
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,199
the elementary stream

2727
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:35,280
uh and that should hopefully be defined

2728
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,360
first and then the rtv payload format

2729
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,080
for it but i think that this that the

2730
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,480
hope i think was that this was

2731
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,600
simple enough and generic enough that it

2732
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,000
it didn't need an entire

2733
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,159
working group or other sdo

2734
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:52,320
for the codec piece that we're not

2735
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,960
trying to define a very you know bit

2736
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,320
tight codec of you know large volume

2737
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,360
data

2738
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,040
um you know if there was if we're trying

2739
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,280
to describe entire you know

2740
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,040
entire worlds

2741
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,800
absolutely this should go to some other

2742
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,199
you know sdo that's you know creating

2743
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:10,880
you know world point cloud compression

2744
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,320
and things like that but i think the

2745
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,159
hope here is that this is something

2746
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:15,040
simple

2747
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,560
that's you know uh

2748
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,840
conveying

2749
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,840
low low rate data

2750
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,840
you know low volume data

2751
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,719
not describing entire worlds but

2752
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,800
just a few vertices can we do something

2753
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,239
like that simply in a generic rtp

2754
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,880
payload format without a really big

2755
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,679
elementary stream codec document and

2756
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:37,679
another sdo i think that's the hope here

2757
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:39,920
and if if people are on board with doing

2758
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,159
something simple like that um i think

2759
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:44,080
it'd be a relatively quick effort

2760
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,000
and if somebody wants something much

2761
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,239
more complex they they're welcome to go

2762
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:48,960
to

2763
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,520
you know mpeg or ao media or somewhere

2764
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,679
else who have active bodies working on

2765
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:55,920
things like this like game world

2766
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,920
descriptions 3d world descriptions and

2767
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,280
things like that i don't think that's

2768
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,719
what this draft is asking for anything

2769
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,360
that complex

2770
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,320
bernard

2771
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,880
yeah i think one argument for doing in

2772
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,360
any abt core is i've been besieged by

2773
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,040
questions about exactly this kind of

2774
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,880
thing cullen

2775
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,719
and people wanted to do it at all we're

2776
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:19,440
rtp because of the timing and everything

2777
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,880
the next question they said is oh i

2778
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,960
can't do it in webrtc so i have to use

2779
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,119
the data channel i don't really want to

2780
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:27,520
but that's all that's available to me so

2781
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:28,960
the kind of people who are doing this

2782
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,679
stuff they are interested in webrtc and

2783
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,760
they are interested in rtp

2784
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,840
so if you know it's worth a try to get

2785
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,280
them in here

2786
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,400
because otherwise they're just going to

2787
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,600
bother me

2788
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,639
and

2789
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:42,800
i'd rather have them come here and talk

2790
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,719
to a bunch of other people and just

2791
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:47,520
continually uh you know ask me how why

2792
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,679
this isn't supported well in our in

2793
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:52,679
webrtc

2794
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,360
so you know give it a try uh you can

2795
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,679
always failure is always an option but

2796
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:00,239
um i can't think of any place better

2797
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:01,600
like i can't think of any place where i

2798
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,520
would tell those people to go that's

2799
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,840
better than here let me put it that way

2800
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:17,360
so stefan wenger i have two things that

2801
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,480
are replies one is to say show about

2802
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,800
um you have to send the stuff as quickly

2803
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,560
as you can

2804
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,000
um

2805
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,719
potentially unsynchronized

2806
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:30,960
in

2807
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,679
transcend where i work now is is a

2808
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:35,600
pretty big game company right and we

2809
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,760
look into this type of stuff

2810
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:38,800
uh

2811
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,199
a little bit also and

2812
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:42,639
um

2813
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:44,880
as soon as you are getting away from

2814
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,080
from the most trivial proof of concept

2815
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,600
implementations

2816
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,159
time synchronization is perhaps the most

2817
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:54,880
critical and the most important part of

2818
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,280
of the whole story yeah not only for

2819
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,280
multi-user games for everything

2820
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,080
so a protocol that has an inherent

2821
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,639
understanding of time

2822
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:06,800
is required there and that suggests to

2823
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,040
me that rtp is actually the right

2824
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,920
transport never mind

2825
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,320
where that payload is defined

2826
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,719
so and the other was regarding to those

2827
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:18,880
forks who say um

2828
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,400
let's do something quick and dirty here

2829
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:27,280
you know i'm i'm not objecting but

2830
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:30,719
quick and dirty projects have a tendency

2831
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,679
to to mushroom out of

2832
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:36,159
first in the itf nothing is quick that's

2833
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:38,159
that's number one right

2834
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:39,920
you know i i remember when we when

2835
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,159
webrtc was booted yeah let's do that in

2836
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:43,760
a year we have it right and 10 years

2837
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,719
later we had it finally it's the itf is

2838
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:48,480
the wrong organization to do something

2839
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,679
quick

2840
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:52,000
that's number one but even if it were a

2841
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,600
good organization

2842
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,480
um

2843
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,360
there will be always those guys

2844
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,440
who

2845
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,040
strive for perfection and add use cases

2846
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,440
and that whole thing will mushroom out

2847
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,800
of control

2848
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,679
in an in an organization that's

2849
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:11,600
really not that well prepared to deal

2850
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,040
with it right

2851
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,199
and so unless you have an

2852
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:17,199
a a group of companies a group of

2853
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:19,520
organization a core group who

2854
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,639
who goes

2855
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:23,040
hell-bent in exactly one direction

2856
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,119
without leaving everyone else behind

2857
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:27,199
like the opus guys did right when you

2858
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:30,080
have that and you can't keep it focused

2859
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,520
maybe

2860
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,560
but as a single company thing i wouldn't

2861
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,480
i wouldn't suggest to do this here i

2862
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,920
really wouldn't

2863
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:38,880
and

2864
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:39,760
you know

2865
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,679
if you do it

2866
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:43,360
have a buff

2867
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,760
have a working group just just just do

2868
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,560
it it that will not take that much more

2869
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:51,520
time thank you

2870
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,960
colin i see you asking to share slides

2871
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:58,159
are you trying to speak or are you

2872
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,360
uh i i'm i'm trying to speak and i can't

2873
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:04,239
figure out which button

2874
01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:06,480
um

2875
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:07,640
so i think um

2876
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:09,840
[Music]

2877
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,600
being slightly flipped and following on

2878
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,639
from

2879
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:14,800
stefan's comment uh you can have fast or

2880
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,119
you can have consensus based and pick

2881
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:18,480
one

2882
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,000
um

2883
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,480
i i think uh what i came up to say i

2884
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,800
think jonathan has this this right uh

2885
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,159
you know if we can bring the domain

2886
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:28,320
experts understand the data model uh

2887
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,040
into this group that then i think adt

2888
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,960
core is an entirely reasonable place to

2889
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:34,320
do this work

2890
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,719
um and that this seems like something

2891
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:38,800
which is uh perfectly reasonable to do

2892
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,520
it over rtp and it seems to me no more

2893
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,280
complex than some of the other formats

2894
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:44,400
we've done

2895
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,239
uh and i think looking back to some of

2896
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:46,960
the

2897
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,600
the midi payload formats or some of the

2898
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,440
conversational media for hearing

2899
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,440
impaired users for example

2900
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,960
they were both a little bit outside the

2901
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,480
core expertise of the group and we

2902
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,320
brought in people who understood those

2903
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,320
formats and we definitely defined

2904
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,719
how they work over rtp

2905
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,960
how they work over atp uh and i think we

2906
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,880
can do the same here so so this this

2907
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,320
seems like a perfectly reasonable home

2908
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,520
for the work

2909
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,040
uh and i would suggest whatever you do

2910
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,560
don't do a buff because you'll be stuck

2911
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,600
for a decade if you do

2912
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,280
uh yeah i know i'm i'm with you on that

2913
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,040
and look i will try and bring that

2914
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:23,520
together but like realize that a large

2915
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,119
portion of the use cases from this what

2916
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:26,480
they need to send

2917
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:29,040
is a single location and the rate of

2918
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,960
change of the location and the object id

2919
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:33,280
that is that is like the 90 use case so

2920
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,560
i mean we can understand that pretty

2921
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,560
easily but i mean like i get everybody's

2922
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,400
point on bringing in the experts the

2923
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,159
problem is is unless you start something

2924
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:41,760
this is one of those ones where like why

2925
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,679
would they come here like unless we're

2926
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:45,040
doing something in this space they're

2927
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,480
not going to come this is one of those

2928
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,320
you know chicken and egg problems on

2929
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:51,360
getting work new work moving forward um

2930
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:52,800
and

2931
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,040
you know as ted put it i mean it's going

2932
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,639
to be a little dirty

2933
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:58,750
that's fine

2934
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:00,960
[Music]

2935
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,400
sue us you keep going in and out of the

2936
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,480
queue did you want to talk or are you

2937
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:07,280
being indecisive

2938
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,199
just trying to try some controls here

2939
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:13,199
but one thing i really wanted to say

2940
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:15,920
here is that uh going back to most point

2941
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:16,719
um

2942
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:17,840
well if

2943
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,840
if you're asking something uh as simple

2944
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,520
as uh some kind of a tlv based values uh

2945
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,080
and we want to leverage uh what rtp

2946
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,520
provides for

2947
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,560
and payload uh that's that's defined

2948
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,880
somehow uh but it provides all those

2949
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,040
measurements to kind of synchronize in

2950
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,040
in in a way with other streams that are

2951
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,760
going with rtp i i i strongly think it

2952
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:42,320
should be taken by every core and on on

2953
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,400
on exactly what goes in that uh like

2954
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,800
it's like sending text or rtp right it

2955
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,800
does not really uh need a lot of

2956
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,320
expertise to come come and figure out

2957
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,880
what goes in the text um

2958
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,719
if it if it helps i would i would

2959
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,159
suggest that the draft should basically

2960
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:58,560
say what this does not do to kind of not

2961
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,119
have the kind of the ball the entire

2962
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:02,000
ocean

2963
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,080
uh kind of thing and be very specific on

2964
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,440
what's doing and have at least

2965
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,040
a way to come and

2966
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,800
present you know what this actually

2967
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:13,040
stored uh or what's been actually being

2968
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,880
sent that way it might be much easier

2969
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,560
for people to just think you know

2970
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:17,760
instance think of the game moves and

2971
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:18,960
everything about the game we know you're

2972
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,159
not talking about everything about the

2973
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:22,239
game but we're just talking about

2974
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:24,800
these three things and that way it might

2975
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,119
make the entire group to decide uh this

2976
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:29,119
does not require that much of expertise

2977
01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:30,320
so probably that's that's one one thing

2978
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,719
i would like to provide some feedback to

2979
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:35,119
colleen

2980
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:37,840
max

2981
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:40,320
magnus piston uh yeah sorry colin about

2982
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,639
i mean i think my comment was

2983
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:44,400
i just comment on the dispatch list

2984
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,880
about its suitability for rtp

2985
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,599
and then i should have said that yes the

2986
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:51,760
format question is probably should have

2987
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,560
been dispatched um

2988
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,719
but yeah it still remains this question

2989
01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:58,159
what's the most appropriate when you're

2990
01:50:58,159 --> 01:51:00,560
here etc and i think anything here will

2991
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,080
it's going to require some reshortering

2992
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:03,679
somewhere

2993
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:04,880
anyway

2994
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:05,840
i don't think this requires any

2995
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,239
recharging in avt to be to do this it's

2996
01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:10,320
hits well with it's like it's much less

2997
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,000
of an issue than many other things we've

2998
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,040
done in here so

2999
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:21,119
uh okay um

3000
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,560
no i mean look you know this charter

3001
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,280
better than anyone

3002
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,760
i might have wrote in it but i've

3003
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:30,639
probably forgotten it

3004
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:32,480
that's fair too but i mean like

3005
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,480
yeah

3006
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,280
um

3007
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:44,000
this is spencer dawkins and uh

3008
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:46,400
i may be wrong about this but it sounds

3009
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,639
like we're trying to figure out

3010
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:51,040
where is the right place to send

3011
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,360
something to figure out where the right

3012
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,920
place to send it is

3013
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,679
and

3014
01:51:57,679 --> 01:51:59,760
that's not a recipe for

3015
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,840
ietf wins

3016
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,080
also it's not a problem that abt core

3017
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,440
can solve

3018
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:09,440
but it's not a recipe for itf when

3019
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,520
well i mean the way we got the real-time

3020
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,080
tax people to come and participate is by

3021
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,080
saying we were doing it and putting a

3022
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:17,679
straw man on the table

3023
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:19,760
right and they did not give us the time

3024
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:21,920
of day until we did that right and then

3025
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,760
we ended up with some protocols out of

3026
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,159
that um which are now

3027
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:28,320
mandated by law in some places

3028
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,199
um

3029
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:30,800
so i mean i

3030
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,880
you know it's it's one of these things

3031
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,480
like

3032
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:37,520
it's really easy to just say i mean it's

3033
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:38,960
it's really hard to figure out how how

3034
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,480
you bring new work forward i guess one

3035
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:42,480
thing that i will say about this is the

3036
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,159
odds of this you know failure is an

3037
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:45,840
option here the odds of this causing any

3038
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,239
harm to the internet is absolutely zero

3039
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:49,760
right this is not you know this isn't

3040
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,199
going to break our architecture this

3041
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:53,280
isn't you know it's not the spin bit god

3042
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,800
forbid um you know it's a pretty simple

3043
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,199
thing we could do something

3044
01:52:59,199 --> 01:53:00,880
no one cares whether the draft was

3045
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,360
marked experimental informational bcp

3046
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,639
whatever right it's just like hey is

3047
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:05,679
there going to be some work happening

3048
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:06,800
none of these people care in the

3049
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,880
slightest what the status level is

3050
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,320
um you know is there a way to move it

3051
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,080
forward and i mean

3052
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,520
yeah we could have had this discussion

3053
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:14,719
in dispatch but it would have been the

3054
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:16,159
same people at the mic saying the same

3055
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:17,760
thing and yeah we all wish we could get

3056
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,440
a whole bunch of the experts in here to

3057
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,599
do it but

3058
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:22,880
um i guess the question is how are we

3059
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,239
going to get to that

3060
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:26,800
and uh you know if the answer is go form

3061
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,159
a bunch of group of companies together

3062
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:29,760
this is not going to happen at itf it's

3063
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:30,800
going to happen in external codes

3064
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,040
already

3065
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:37,199
uh

3066
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:38,880
sergio

3067
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,920
yep i think that there are two different

3068
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:45,280
uh aspects of this proposal one is to

3069
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:49,280
define protocol to create

3070
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,760
this this game data or

3071
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,679
synchronization or whatever we want and

3072
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:56,800
then how to transfer that data our rtp

3073
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:59,280
obviously the transcription that we are

3074
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,840
so that it is within this charter

3075
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:04,320
i'm not going to i'm not not sure if it

3076
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,280
is in the

3077
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:07,679
just defining the protocol itself

3078
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,760
is within this charter or not but it is

3079
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,360
something that it would be interesting

3080
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:13,199
for me for the protocols

3081
01:54:13,199 --> 01:54:14,960
because it seems that

3082
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,560
there is no

3083
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,400
real a very good place to do it

3084
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,080
everywhere else so

3085
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:22,159
and and i think that it would be good if

3086
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:25,599
we could define the two things uh also a

3087
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:27,520
protocol that we could use

3088
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,840
not only in rtp but in other transports

3089
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:30,960
for example

3090
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,840
i want to say quick to name one

3091
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,520
and then define also how to

3092
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,840
to transport that in a synchronized way

3093
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:43,639
with other rtp data

3094
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,920
i'm struggling to see why this is

3095
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:58,239
controversial um

3096
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:00,080
you know it it's if we're going to do

3097
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,639
that over rtp it's my tp payload format

3098
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:04,480
which is what this group does

3099
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:05,280
um

3100
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:06,880
we need the people with the domain

3101
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,440
expertise but uh yeah that is the same

3102
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,520
for every other codec or every other

3103
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:12,719
payload form that we've done in the

3104
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:15,119
history of this group over the last

3105
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:18,960
20 25 years

3106
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,280
as cullen says there is no architectural

3107
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,040
harm if we get this wrong it's just yet

3108
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:24,639
another payload format that people don't

3109
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:29,239
use so this seems straightforward

3110
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,480
all right it sounds like there is

3111
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,080
at least rough consensus would be in

3112
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:37,679
scope of this group

3113
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:38,960
um

3114
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:39,920
are we at the point where we actually

3115
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,280
want to do a call for adoption or we

3116
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,719
want to just

3117
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:44,320
say um

3118
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,480
we're open to it and

3119
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,760
colin should keep it should iterate

3120
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:52,960
something that she thinks is the

3121
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:55,840
you know who that do you think would be

3122
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,920
a good thing to call for adoption

3123
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:01,199
bernard you want to go first yeah i um

3124
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:03,360
i i don't call for adoption might be

3125
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:07,280
useful because it it is basically uh

3126
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,280
you can maybe try to get the people who

3127
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,560
would work on it

3128
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,239
to come and actually answer the call for

3129
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:13,520
adoption you could say hey there's a

3130
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,400
call for adoption what do you think

3131
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:19,760
so it's it's a way of getting input

3132
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:22,000
so stefan wenger the classic question at

3133
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,560
this point in most working groups is how

3134
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:28,800
many people have read the draft

3135
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,159
let's ask that how many people okay fair

3136
01:56:31,159 --> 01:56:35,480
enough let's see

3137
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:53,000
all right i'll do a poll

3138
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:06,679
no we're gonna go

3139
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,400
yeah that's pretty impressive for this

3140
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,239
group yeah that's more than most our

3141
01:57:14,239 --> 01:57:17,199
working group drafts yeah exactly so

3142
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:20,678
that's a good sign

3143
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:26,800
um

3144
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,320
so

3145
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:31,840
yeah so that's a good sign to us

3146
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:36,480
my input and is thinking about

3147
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:38,960
getting more people involved would be

3148
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,119
a nice way to get to get adopted and

3149
01:57:41,119 --> 01:57:44,000
also it provides authors um a kind of an

3150
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,760
um a way to

3151
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:50,040
clear direction to move forward as well

3152
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,599
mozinati uh

3153
01:57:55,599 --> 01:57:57,280
i think uh stefan would be very

3154
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,199
interesting and useful if you could get

3155
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:00,960
uh someone at tencent

3156
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,159
uh to get feedback about about the uh

3157
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:05,840
call for adoption

3158
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:08,560
if if a game company is not interested

3159
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,159
in this it would be

3160
01:58:10,159 --> 01:58:12,239
it would be interesting to know

3161
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:14,000
why not and what other venues they would

3162
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,560
prefer to work

3163
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:21,440
yes in impact for very large complex

3164
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,639
things but for something simple just

3165
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:24,159
like you know

3166
01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:27,440
hand or head locations

3167
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,480
all right so it sounds like um

3168
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,880
probably bernard and i should do a

3169
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,000
call for an option on this because it

3170
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,280
sounds like people are do you think it's

3171
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:37,920
in scope for the group

3172
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,320
okay and thank you and look also on my

3173
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,400
last slide was like looking for input

3174
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,480
co-authors uh work with other things

3175
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,520
obviously you're trying to build a

3176
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:46,719
community around this so anything you

3177
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:48,960
can do to help uh point people this

3178
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:50,960
direction and connect me up with people

3179
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,800
that's what we want to do

3180
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,400
yeah i mean one thing we could do is we

3181
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:55,920
could have a call for adoption a little

3182
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:58,000
bit longer than usual and then forward

3183
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
it to have people forward it to places

3184
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,440
that might be interested i have no idea

3185
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:04,719
what those are but we can figure it out

3186
01:59:04,719 --> 01:59:07,520
sounds good all right

3187
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,800
and

3188
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,480
now we have one minute to talk about uh

3189
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,800
short tags i guess short time for short

3190
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:14,960
tags i don't think that would happen but

3191
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:17,280
uh no sorry

3192
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,519
but

3193
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,199
um

3194
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:22,000
i'll

3195
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,280
i'll i'll send the stuff on short

3196
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:24,880
stacked to the list and maybe we can

3197
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,320
have another call on that at some point

3198
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,920
i i mean actually

3199
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:28,719
maybe

3200
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:30,480
would i guess the only question here

3201
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:31,599
would there be a group of people

3202
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:33,440
interested in having uh you know a

3203
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:36,080
little not even an intern meeting but uh

3204
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:38,719
a phone call sometime on short tags uh

3205
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:41,960
going forward

3206
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,239
but yeah it's also on magnus if you

3207
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:47,520
could forward that the link to that

3208
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:48,880
paper you wrote

3209
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:52,000
about why just doing short gcm is not

3210
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:52,960
good

3211
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:56,679
that would be helpful

3212
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:02,159
all right um yeah okay so thank you

3213
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:03,599
everybody

3214
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:06,080
um

3215
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:09,119
and uh yeah so i mean obviously we need

3216
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:11,760
to do something other than just you know

3217
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,159
something that isn't broken by magnus's

3218
02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:15,360
draft but presumably there's other

3219
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,840
cryptography we could do so

3220
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:19,119
um

3221
02:00:19,119 --> 02:00:21,199
colin sent the link to that in the chat

3222
02:00:21,199 --> 02:00:22,080
probably which i'll send it to the

3223
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:23,599
mailing list just

3224
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:24,880
so it's

3225
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:28,320
okay so i guess um

3226
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:30,480
probably bernard and i should try to

3227
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:33,040
arrange a short tags call or interim or

3228
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:34,880
whatever however we want to do it

3229
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:38,080
uh we'll figure that out yeah

3230
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:40,400
uh

3231
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,320
yeah i think we'll we'll uh take that to

3232
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:44,400
the list and we're almost

3233
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,239
we're almost out of time i think we are

3234
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:48,719
back out of time so thank you everybody

3235
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:50,719
um and uh

3236
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:51,520
we'll

3237
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,040
figure out if we need to do any interims

3238
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,520
or we'll see you in philadelphia

3239
