1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,879
it's quite possible that the hotel might

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,320
have more ups

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,960
and this is the iegf stuff is great it's

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
just the stuff that we had in the

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,439
box fort

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,160
i know a lot of hotels took the

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,920
opportunity to be like oh we're

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,519
innovating

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,599
right over the past couple of years

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,119
or we're shutting down you know that'll

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,599
be another thing you can do i mean

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,920
it's quite possible

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,480
mundane reasons

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,469
[Music]

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,239

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,680

oh

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,240
all right

29
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,199
it

30
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,199
is the mic on its own

31
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,960
please please come in and take a seat

32
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,520
and the mic is really on

33
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,198
uh welcome everybody um

34
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
yeah my name is liz eckhart i chaired

35
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,919
the ihf since a year ago

36
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,680
it's very very nice to see all of you

37
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
here in person it really feels like an

38
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
itf meeting although

39
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
as you probably can realize we're not

40
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,240
quite at the usual bench strength but um

41
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,000
it does feel really good it really feels

42
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,680
like it's been a long time it's been way

43
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,039
too long and uh i also hope the remote

44
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,879
participants will have a chance to join

45
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,120
us again at some time in the future um

46
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,520
hopefully in philadelphia or in london

47
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
later in the year or at any other time

48
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,160
and

49
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
we're also hoping that the improvements

50
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,440
we made

51
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,800
to the tooling for remote participation

52
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,560
because of corona will have a sort of

53
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
lasting impact

54
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
that will

55
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,759
open up the organization to more

56
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,599
participants

57
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,199
in into the future

58
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,599
because i really think

59
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,360
we're not going to go back to the old

60
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,199
style meeting for a while

61
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,599
and it's also so it's exciting to be

62
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,120
here in person

63
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,319
it's also quite sad and i'm pretty

64
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,039
emotional about this so i'm struggling a

65
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,120
little bit here but you know it's been

66
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,760
sad because obviously because of covid

67
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
we haven't really been able to meet um

68
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,279
for a long time

69
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,719
and some people had some extremely

70
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,958
challenging years

71
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,200
um and it remains an ongoing concern for

72
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,839
many of us

73
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,080
but also walking around the city right

74
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,000
you can't miss the signs that a war is

75
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,040
going on

76
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,720
right now

77
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,440
and it's a tragedy

78
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,920
and the war in ukraine feels very

79
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
personal because

80
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,880
we know that some of our friends and

81
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
families and colleagues are directly

82
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,279
affected

83
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,360
and the personal safety and security is

84
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,560
at stake

85
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
and their lives are in peril

86
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,760
so we worry about the safety

87
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,839
of our ukrainian colleagues

88
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,399
and their families

89
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,360
and

90
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
being so directly impacted

91
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,200
makes it difficult to concentrate on the

92
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,360
work of the itf which is

93
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
making the internet work better

94
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,880
um

95
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,920
and uh

96
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,640
i personally sort of

97
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,080
believe the inner is fundamentally about

98
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,760
connecting people

99
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,880
and

100
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,959
i can take some little bit of comfort

101
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,560
because

102
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,399
i choose to believe that

103
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,680
doing so

104
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
will hopefully allow us in the future to

105
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,480
avoid

106
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,720
needless wars

107
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,120
thank you

108
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
that's it um

109
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,920
some things never change and you can

110
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,839
take a great comfort that the

111
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,480
note well slide remains

112
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
as unreadable

113
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
as it has been

114
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,040
for decades now so

115
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,120
if you're new to the organization this

116
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,640
is

117
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,279
what we require of you as participants

118
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,680
please try and read it it's not very

119
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
easy but um you should be familiar with

120
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,040
it by now

121
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,720
um

122
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,240
there are some tips on how to

123
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,640
participate here

124
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,480
um when you join me deco which is the

125
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
tool we're using for displenary

126
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,959
your audio will be muted your video will

127
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,800
be off

128
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,399
and would you like to speak

129
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,160
from the floor or

130
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,480
i guess up on stage um

131
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,519
please unmute yourself

132
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,800
when you are recognized in the queue

133
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,399
and we ask you to share your video if

134
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,000
you feel comfortable doing so because it

135
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,279
makes it a bit more

136
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,800
personal

137
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,560
and if you have a headset please use it

138
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
it makes a big difference

139
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,640
and there's a lot of other helpful tips

140
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,959
that you can follow if you choose to do

141
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,650
so

i said it feels like an itf meeting and

250
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,120
it kind of is except for the mask and

251
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
some of these other you know corona

252
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,120
specified things but

253
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,519
secretariat has done an heroic job to uh

254
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,480
pull this together and the corona

255
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,639
restrictions in austria were

256
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,480
quite a bit more strict until very

257
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
recently and so all the planning went

258
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,959
towards that much more strict type of

259
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,920
meeting

260
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,240
which was um even more work than what we

261
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,600
have now so thank you very much the

262
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,079
secretary of meet echo the knock

263
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,160
all of which

264
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
handled the relocation which happened

265
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,720
really late in the cycle from bangkok to

266
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
vienna very well

267
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,240

268
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720

270
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:10,240
[Applause]

271
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,680
which brings me to the boring part which

272
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
is the chair report um

273
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,320
participant statistics and a few other

274
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,839
of the usual suspects we're going to go

275
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,199
through very quickly so we have time for

276
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,040
open mic

277
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
we did see an uptick in registration

278
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
numbers we are

279
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,880
just under 1400

280
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,079
total

281
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,639
just over 300 onsite in 1100 remote

282
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,240
which is

283
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,759
about in line with the regular

284
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,399
quote-unquote european meeting so we did

285
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,320
see a significant uptick in the last two

286
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,199
weeks to normal numbers

287
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,759
we used almost 250 fee waivers which is

288
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,800
great

289
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
allows people that otherwise couldn't

290
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,839
afford to participate to participate

291
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,199
remotely

292
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,399
we're going to continue

293
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
the fee waiver program

294
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,560
into the future so there will always be

295
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,680
a

296
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,560
free

297
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,680
remote participation option at itf's

298
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,759
we have 231 hackathon registrations

299
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,600
which considering

300
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,959
you know

301
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,679
134 of those were online so a lot more

302
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,880
of the online people actually rented a

303
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,359
hackathon for 50

304
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,520
uh roughly it's great um and we had a

305
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,599
lot of people participating remotely

306
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,679
statistics by country i think this is

307
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,359
for the total

308
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,119
number of uh participants you can see

309
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,919
it's the usual split more or less and i

310
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,199
think i have an extra slide that i

311
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,880
haven't seen yet

312
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
on this breakdown between on-site and

313
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
remote so join me looking at this light

314
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,720
for the first time

315
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,280
we have uh as i said 300 people on site

316
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,600
and about 1100 remote

317
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,360
and the breakdown glancing from up here

318
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
looks pretty much identical so i don't

319
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
know what we learned from that but

320
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
apparently the

321
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,000
cove did not keep

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,520
some regions of the world further away

323
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,400
than others so that's i guess good um

324
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,600
but

325
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,120
okay i'm getting corrected from the

326
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,840
floor

327
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,559
the colors are different okay

328
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,240
well since i can't read the font

329
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,039
do do what you will with that

330
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,120
information so i guess we will

331
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,520
i will stop analyzing uh things i can't

332
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,039
read

333
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,799
but you can look at these uh in the

334
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,200
minutes

335
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,559
right future meetings um

336
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,080
we have a bunch of different ways so we

337
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,679
have a for a while now i had to support

338
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,679
at itf.org email address which is your

339
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,919
one stop shop for anything goes into the

340
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,600
ticket system and you get directed to

341
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
the right person for your request

342
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,520
um if you have something urgent about

343
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
the meeting or something else

344
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,039
it's typically a good idea to email that

345
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,039
rather than some random mailing list

346
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,880
where the secretariat is not hanging out

347
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,000
to handle your requests immediately

348
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,679
for tools specifically it's also a good

349
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,200
idea to email tools discuss

350
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,320
um jay is about to send out the post 113

351
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,799
survey which has a bunch of

352
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,400
new questions because it's our first

353
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,679
hybrid meeting

354
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,120
and we do want to know how that worked

355
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,559
for you especially those of you who are

356
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,440
here

357
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,039
but also those of you who are using the

358
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,480
remote tooling for the first time

359
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,480
and we have the shmu working group

360
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
that is still meeting as far as i

361
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
remember

362
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,840
which is our general generic group that

363
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,120
talks about

364
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,159
meeting related things

365
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,960
right um

366
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,240
we have a few things that are

367
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,760
experiments

368
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,720
or

369
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,960
planned actions

370
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
um we have an ongoing um

371
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,080
comment period on the proposal to

372
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,600
archive

373
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,480
discussions between document authors and

374
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,200
the rpc during world 48

375
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
um i think it runs until tomorrow so if

376
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,039
you have strong feelings we have a day

377
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,280
to send them

378
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,120
we are constantly

379
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,240
tweaking the way we review buffs

380
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,000
proposals for new work

381
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,919
because they're important

382
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,960
um

383
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,480
so we're scheduling

384
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,240
when you need to submit them by how

385
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,080
we're viewing them so we can give you

386
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,960
feedback we're also

387
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,440
looking at running

388
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,240
more

389
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,039
virtual slash interim buffs and these

390
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,320
are not necessarily new because we've

391
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,919
had them but very rarely in the past and

392
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,760
we recently decided there's specifically

393
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,039
because of the band that make really no

394
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,720
reason to try and have more of those it

395
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,919
seems silly

396
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,679
that proponents of an idea have to work

397
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,679
until the next meeting just to have a

398
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,840
session

399
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,600
and we

400
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,039
discussed that we're going to create

401
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,919
this

402
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,360
important news announcement list which

403
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,120
is going to be very low volume

404
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,480
but we'll also go to everybody with a

405
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
data tracker account because we need a

406
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
way to communicate with you guys

407
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,000
right um we had zero appeals since the

408
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,679
last itf so

409
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,400
thank you for that

410
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,520
um and we made did one statement on how

411
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
you should as an author

412
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,320
um understand when you get isg ballot

413
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,120
position emails um and i think to short

414
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,039
version is don't freak out

415
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,960
um it's not as bad as you think it is

416
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,320
there's a lot more written reports

417
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,919
including ours

418
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,159
at the url there that you can look at

419
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,000
there's also the idf blog

420
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,320
that sort of gets fresh content every

421
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,679
once in a while

422
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,440
that's also worth checking out

423
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,520
and now i'd like to hand over to robert

424
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,440
from the tools team

425
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,799
and i can

426
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,840
try to give you control

427
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,080
except i can't

428
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
testing testing

429
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,679
i can hear you i'm just trying to make

430
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,039
you

431
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,799
able to drive the slides

432
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,360
how's this

433
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,840
it looks like it's updating

434
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,000
all right should be able to drive

435
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,640
so hello everyone i'll see if my next

436
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,760
slide

437
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,240
yes as lars mentioned there has been a

438
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,799
lot of activity around

439
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,520
the repositories for the tools that we

440
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,480
use

441
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,840
at the ietf we are completing a project

442
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,960
to move

443
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,840
the largest ones to github

444
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,679
these are on the slide

445
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,400
these are three of nearly 50

446
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,039
repositories that are available in the

447
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,799
ietf tools organization at github

448
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,360
i encourage everyone to go explore all

449
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,760
of them

450
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,000
now that we're at github

451
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,039
we're asking that people use it for

452
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,360
bug reports and feature requests using

453
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,520
the issues and discussion

454
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,080
mechanisms that are at github

455
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,320
and you can also send email to

456
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,919
toolsdiscuss at ietf.org which is a

457
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,400
backstop for people that have any any

458
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,799
difficulties um using github for

459
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,200
whatever reason

460
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
please take a moment when you can to

461
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,440
read the contributing

462
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,919
document that i've got

463
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,720
on the slide you can find it

464
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,039
linked from the readme from each of the

465
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,640
repositories

466
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,720
that will give you a good overview of of

467
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,880
how you can engage if you want to to

468
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,600
work on the code beyond providing bug

469
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,440
reports and feature requests and

470
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,840
engaging in the discussions and join our

471
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,159
code sprints when you can

472
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,960
watch the tools discuss list for um

473
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,960
when these when these are going to occur

474
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
the

475
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,840
tools discuss list is also discuss list

476
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,720
is also a good place to um send code

477
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,559
contributions if for some reason you

478
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,159
have no no

479
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,799
ability to to push things directly to

480
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,840
github

481
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,919
um i'll always be willing to take

482
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,320
patches directly and manipulate things

483
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,400
into the repositories on your behalf

484
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,640
the tools team meets regularly you can

485
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,320
watch for their meetings in the upcoming

486
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,039
meetings calendar and we have a set of

487
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,279
workshops that are are that we're

488
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,360
working on scheduling you can look in

489
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,440
that repository to find out what they're

490
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
about

491
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,000
i also wanted to point to a new set of

492
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,240
resources that are available to us at

493
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,760
authors.ietf.org there are

494
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,320
tools up there that describe how to

495
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,200
author how to convert things from

496
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,080
provide tools for converting things from

497
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,559
the authoring formats into the various

498
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,000
rendering formats and doing guests

499
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,320
um we'll also have a bib xml service up

500
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,799
there very soon

501
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,440
um the last comment that i'd like to

502
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,400
make is

503
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,039
look at the discussion on tools discuss

504
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,240
about the work that we're doing on the

505
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
way the data tracker looks we're

506
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
currently moving very quickly towards a

507
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,240
major update to the look and feel of the

508
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,600
data tracker

509
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,960
you can find information on the tools

510
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,039
discussed list about how to see what

511
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,640
that's going to look like

512
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,120
and help us find any issues in it before

513
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,840
it becomes production if you if you have

514
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,760
the time to contribute

515
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
thank you

516
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,279
thanks robert and i think i remember

517
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,600
that the author tools idf drug wallet is

518
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,880
working for many people already it's

519
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,120
still considered better and so if you

520
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,600
find issues please report them it's much

521
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,360
better than the old tool that we had

522
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,279
already but i think there's still some

523
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,720
things that are still being improved so

524
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,919
thanks for that

525
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,679
and um i think next i'm going to hand

526
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,679

550
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,520
them yourself

551
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,679
um and i'm only reporting a little bit

552
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,840
here on like the important admin stuff

553
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,120
but if you're actually interested what

554
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,039
the iab is doing otherwise interested in

555
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,799
engaging with some technical and

556
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,720
technical discussion with the iab we

557
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,120
have the iab open session tomorrow so

558
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,000
there will be a little bit more

559
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,840
reporting tomorrow about what we

560
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
actually do and there will be a

561
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,679
discussion about centralization or

562
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,320
actually how to encounter centralization

563
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,080
um tomorrow so it would be great to see

564
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,200
you all there

565
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,720
um maybe not all of you because it's a

566
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,159
smaller room but many of you

567
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,840
oh sorry now i skipped some slides

568
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
yeah i slip and skip this important

569
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,279
slide so one of the big announcements

570
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,600
today is that we have a new independent

571
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,399
submission editor um the iab recently

572
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,200
appointed elliot lear to

573
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600
take over this position unfortunately he

574
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,159
is not here today um but i'm sure you

575
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,919
maybe had a chance to meet him online

576
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,679
there were office hours and hopefully we

577
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,360
will see him next time again and like

578
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,279
he's pretty well known to many of you i

579
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,200
think otherwise all i can give you at

580
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,520
this point is this photo here

581
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,279
um and i would also like to take the

582
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,360
opportunity to say thank you to adrian

583
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,440
again um i already announced last time

584
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,919
that he decided to step down after i'm

585
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,320
four years and so this transition had

586
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,159
just happened recently he already

587
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,480
stepped down he's unfortunately also not

588
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,559
here so like again no chance to have a

589
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,640
nice dinner with him and but we will

590
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,159
ship him some chocolate from here

591
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,760
so we got we got this extra large box

592
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,158
for you adrian

593
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,159
okay one more thing i would like to take

594
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,080
a few minutes for

595
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,360
is to announce the outcome of the iab

596
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,600
program that is designing a new rfc

597
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,840
editor model because this program has

598
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,679
basically concluded at work it's still

599
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,080
open if we need to and pick up anything

600
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,880
again but effectively we are done here

601
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
and the new model has quite changed

602
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,399
quite quite a bit

603
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,039
i've presented a few hints about this at

604
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,080
the last plenaries already um but if you

605
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,279
want to know all the details you

606
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,960
probably have to read the document so

607
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,880
we'll not go through this here i just

608
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
wanted to report back where we are

609
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,600
and the status is um that the the

610
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,919
program is basically ready with their

611
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,880
work and handed it to the iab we already

612
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,039
had like a four week community feedback

613
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,080
call

614
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
and we got a lot of feedback because we

615
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,360
were reached out to many community

616
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,600
members and asked for previews actively

617
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,799
to make sure

618
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
people are aware and we have considered

619
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,159
all different angles

620
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,080
and we got a lot of good feedback

621
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,159
fortunately we didn't get any like big

622
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,600
issues out of that i mean there were

623
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,440
definitely some concerns

624
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,440
but nothing that we didn't discuss that

625
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,799
lengthy in the program already and

626
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,720
nothing that we didn't consider so the

627
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,960
bunch of clarifications and make sure

628
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,919
we're going in the right direction here

629
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,399
so the iab has also reviewed

630
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,399
the last version um

631
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,720
which was like just published a few days

632
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,520
ago was like the last editorial changes

633
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,440
and effectively approved this document

634
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
what we're doing right now is we're

635
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,120
actually waiting for three additional

636
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,399
documents um that are small updates to

637
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,720
existing process documents that are

638
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,279
going through the ietf stream these have

639
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,200
effectively also

640
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,279
been proved by the ihg to a certain

641
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,039
extent already but one of the documents

642
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,960
we missed something as always so there

643
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,919
will be another working uh itf last call

644
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,760
and that's what we're waiting for

645
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,640
but um yeah to make the message short is

646
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,480
like we're done and we're heading

647
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,799
forwards and thank you everybody who was

648
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,480
involved because that was quite a big

649
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,440
effort at the end thanks to the chairs

650
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,600
to the editor of the document everybody

651
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
being involved in the discussion all the

652
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
reviewers

653
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,880
i think

654
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,480
it's good to see that we work

655
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,159
productively together and get this done

656
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,640
yeah and this is my last slide also as

657
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,919
usually

658
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,600
an opportunity to thank those people

659
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,439
that we appoint into different positions

660
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,360
we already have selected somebody for

661
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,279
the iso board of trustees but we will

662
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,880
wait for the announcement um to

663
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,720
coordinate with isaac respectively so

664
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
this is still a secret

665
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,919
um but i can thank um peter

666
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,760
who has been reappointed to the icann

667
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
technical esau group to taking over this

668
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,559
position again or keeping this position

669
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,480
and then this is also always a good

670
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
chance for us

671
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,200
to

672
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,640
tell you about our open calls do you

673
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,360

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,360
important to last so i make sure i point

681
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,279
it out carefully

682
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,399
um

683
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,960
we have two open calls one is for the

684
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,880
icann root server systems government

685
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,960
working group and now jared wants to say

686
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,159
something but the mic is still not

687
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,600
working yeah

688
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,000
maybe it'll maybe it'll work but i'm i'm

689
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
guessing that in the future we may need

690
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,159
to use a larger font size for the future

691
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,120
ietf meetings

692
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,240
it's i think it's this green background

693
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,760
color which is irritating here

694
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,080
okay let me start again because that is

695
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,840
important for the iap

696
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,039
um so we have two open calls uh one is

697
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,640
for the i can root server government

698
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,440
working group um so this group is that

699
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,919
isn't supposed to be around forever

700
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,320
um but we're looking for somebody um

701
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,440
committing to kind of work until the end

702
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,080
of this kind of project which will be

703
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,640
you know who knows it's like the idea no

704
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,240
nobody has deadlines but it will be in

705
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,600
commitment for like one or two years

706
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,799
hopefully

707
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:55,760
um

708
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,240
ted was serving us in this position

709
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,640
but because the process got delayed um

710
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,960
he's not able to take this position up

711
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
anymore so we're really looking somebody

712
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,720
who can be engaged in this important

713
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,799
process and thanks for ted serving in

the program that i just talked about

721
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,919

meeting

823
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480

as lars said they've been

828
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,200
very very helpful to us over a long

829
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,880
period now

830
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,240
it's

831
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,839
it's difficult i think for many

832
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,680
organizations to understand what value

833
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,400
they get from sponsoring a meeting that

834
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
is has lower in-person attendance where

835
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,400
you don't know what who's going to be

836
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,200
here

837
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,280
you don't know what um exposure you get

838
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,880
but why i have taken the risk with us a

839
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,320
couple of times now and that's very much

840
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,839

846
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,040
i don't if you know this but the value

your commitment is tremendous

964
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,880
particularly over the long terms it's

965
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,480
very difficult for i think for people to

966
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,160
get budgets in corporates to last this

967
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,079
long and they do so i'm very impressed

968
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,800
by that thank you

969
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,160

974
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,359
[Music]

975
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,319
still working on um asia for 116. we

976
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,680
hope to have an announcement about that

977
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,920
soon it's it's a bit

978
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,599
complicated because of um covid to

979
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,119
come make contractual arrangements with

980
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,200
hotels the um

981
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,640
to put it bluntly they don't believe

982
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,240
that we're not going to cancel so it's

983
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,520
just taking a bit of time for us to

984
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,720
arrange these things but hopefully that

985
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,040
will be arranged soon we have san

986
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,119
francisco one of the rearranged meetings

987
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:55,920
um

988
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,000
prague and then asia which we're looking

989
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,200
at um

990
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,440
uh one of the moved meetings from and

991
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,760
vancouver which was a move meeting so we

992
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,200
we are filling up the pipeline of

993
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,040
meetings coming forward we are still

994
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,280
interested in new ideas and new places

995
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,920
to go to and things or old ideas and old

996
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,560
places to go to um for example i'm told

997
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,640
that london has been completely rebuilt

998
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,319
and we probably won't lose that many of

999
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,720
you there this time so um you know

1000
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,000
please let us know your favorite

1001
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,560
locations

1002
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,680
right the registration numbers

1003
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,400
i think those might be slightly out

1004
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,079
actually so um

1005
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,079
we'll look at those later lars figures

1006
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,079
are the ones that believe on that

1007
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,000
currently

1008
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,760
right so this is um us the staff

1009
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
that's me approximately 25 years ago on

1010
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,599
the left but why would i change the

1011
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,920
picture and then we have greg wood over

1012

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,240
developers is somewhere in the room and

1016
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,319
nick is another software developer who's

1017
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,279
not joined us this time

1018
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,640
right so a small thing about the itf

1019
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,400
endowment so the intf endowment is um

1020
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,960
created to support the iotf and its um

1021
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,119
activities in the long term to create

1022
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,359
long-term sustainability

1023
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,480
we are basically trying to raise money

1024
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,760
so that then

1025
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,599
at some point in the future it would be

1026
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,599
possible to live off the interest of all

1027
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,440
the the investment income from the

1028
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,599
endowment if that's the case

1029
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,440
it gives us a diversity of income makes

1030
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,160
us not reliant on any particular funder

1031
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,319
or and not reliant on any particular

1032
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,560
industry or

1033
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,160
set of companies in that way it's

1034
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,920
something we would like to get to and we

1035
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,440
have a goal of trying to raise 50

1036
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,560
million us dollars by 2027.

1037
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,359
this is particularly useful particularly

1038
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,240
helped at the moment by a commitment

1039
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,680
from the internet society to match fund

1040
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,040
any donations we get so um on the first

1041
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,319
12 million

1042
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,800
we get a two to one match funding and

1043
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
then on the subsequent six million we

1044
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,400
get a um one-to-one match funding so uh

1045
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,640
internet society could end up giving us

1046
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,680
30 million of us raising 80 million 18

1047
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,079
million so that's a huge amount that

1048
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,040
really is

1049
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,839
very useful for us so if you um

1050
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,880
uh can uh help persuade your companies

1051
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,319

1101
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,440
mention

1102
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,520
shortly planning a

1103
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,920
strategic planning retreat and as with

1104
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,160
prior years we'll have large sections of

1105
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,680
time where

1106
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,160
people can observe and ask questions and

1107
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,399
so on

1108
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,520
so in terms of the current work things

1109
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,880
that we have

1110
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,200
recently completed this year since the

1111
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,240
last meeting or are currently working on

1112
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,720
we've made changes to the investment

1113
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,960
policy following recommendations from

1114
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,079
our financial advisors goldman sachs

1115
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,160
in essence um increasing our exposure to

1116
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,839
equity investments

1117
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,359
and also

1118
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,200
considering the possibility of private

1119
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,359
equity investments over time

1120
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,280
uh similar to many other nonprofit funds

1121
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,359
we've also been working obviously on

1122
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,960
this meeting um working with the

1123
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,119
executive director jay and all of the

1124
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,960
other folks here in particular the noc

1125
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,400
team

1126
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,720
to make sure that the first hybrid

1127
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,359
meeting got carried off all right and uh

1128
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,040
be very much looking forward to feedback

1129
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,640
because i think

1130
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,880
as probably lars said at the beginning

1131
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,400
you know this is a model that will

1132
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,559
likely persist for some time

1133
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,520
and

1134
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,680
you know making it work great for both

1135
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,599
in-person and on-site

1136
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,760
uh and remote excuse me participants is

1137
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,359
important

1138
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,839
number three we've been assessing

1139
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,800
potential policy needs and changes

1140
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,880
related to antitrust

1141
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,640
there's been some list discussion about

1142
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,920
that of course

1143
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,480
and we're inching closer and closer to

1144
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,839
uh to sort of a final decision on some

1145
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,040
of those things

1146
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,720
so stay tuned

1147
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,119
uh and of course as i think jay may have

1148
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,200
noted he's relocated now

1149
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,520
um to the united kingdom to london area

1150
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,839
uh greater london from new zealand and

1151
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,559
so we've had to do a bunch of

1152
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,720
you know legal and benefits changes with

1153
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,440
our employment management company

1154
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,960
and lots of odd you know inter

1155
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,400
sort of legal changes but you know

1156
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,839
important stuff to get right to take

1157
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,960
care of our employees like jay

1158
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,800
we're all obviously also planning the

1159
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,680
annual

1160
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,760
strategic planning retreat we should

1161
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,400
have some dates out fairly soon

1162
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,319
and again as i noted welcome

1163
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,559
participation and we've been increasing

1164
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,640
focus on fundraising so that

1165
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,520
fundraising topic is now on our monthly

1166
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,599
agenda and it's something that we are

1167
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,880
focusing on

1168
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,960
all the time to see

1169
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,880
that we're making maximum use of that

1170
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,319
isoc program

1171
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,480
in terms of prior fiscal year operating

1172
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,440
budget

1173
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,400
um

1174
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,280
this will look a lot better as we enter

1175
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,000
into 2022 because we had this sort of

1176
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,319
outstanding accounting

1177
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,640
issue with the way that isoc funding got

1178
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,880
recognized last fiscal year or two

1179
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,040
fiscal years ago excuse me

1180
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,760
so last fiscal year ends up looking odd

1181
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,240
we'll have audited results um you know

1182
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,480
in the relatively near future

1183
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,640
and you know everything is

1184
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,520
uh generally uh on track i think we've

1185
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,079
continued to weather the coveted 19

1186
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,079
disruptions fairly well

1187
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,559
um but again a lot of the the weird

1188
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,319
variances that we see are just due to

1189
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,440
this one-time isoc thing and that is

1190
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,960
should not be an issue for this fiscal

1191
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,400
year so it'll be easier to read our

1192
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,280
financial statements

1193
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,680

control awesome hi i'm glenn dean uh

1208
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,119
from comcast nbc universal i am the

1209
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,160
chair of the icf trust

1210
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,680
so these are the five trustees um they

1211
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,960
are selected by the eye tip nom com one

1212
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,559
of them is selected by the icy border

1213
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,200
trustees and one is selected by

1214
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,640
um the iesg and we've been the same sort

1215
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,760
of group now for a few years which is

1216
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,599
good because uh having trustees around

1217
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,839
there sort of know the lay of the land

1218
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,359
it's

1219
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,280
always good to have people

1220
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,359
that they're well engaged and well aware

1221
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,559
of the background

1222
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,720
um these are some boilerplate plate

1223
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,040
slides because a lot of people you know

1224
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,160
don't really know what the trust does

1225
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,839
we're a pretty quiet bunch

1226
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,200
and that's a good thing because we deal

1227
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,119
with legal stuff and when legal things

1228
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,760
are nice and quiet uh that's the ideal

1229
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,040
situation uh but basically we hold ip

1230
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,760
assets this is like copyrights and uh

1231
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,079
trademarks and domains and software

1232
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,359

1233
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:24,559
icann

1234
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,839
and and water internet related

1235
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,040
activities uh and we make sure these

1236
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,040
things are protected and and

1237
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,520
uh freedom used as appropriate uh but

1238
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,119
also that we don't accidentally lose

1239
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,280
control of them uh through some slippage

1240
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,680
around you know not complying with laws

1241
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,880
and jurisdictional requirements uh we're

1242
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,760
a currently a virginia common trust uh

1243
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,200
we're a non-profit

1244
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,440
uh and uh as i said we have five

1245
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,040
trustees and we're a small group well

1246
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,400
the budget is about a hundred thousand

1247
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,880
dollars uh keep it light keep it tight

1248
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,000
and most that goes towards legal fees

1249
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,440
what i want to talk to you today about

1250
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,000
though is that the trust is having a bit

1251
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,280
of a problem

1252
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,760
and it revolves around uh insurance uh

1253
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,440
trusts when we were created back in 2005

1254
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,400
have evolved a lot and

1255
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,040
we historically carry

1256
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,280
a lot of insurance on our professional

1257
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,440
liability and directors and officers

1258
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,359
insurance to protect the trustees when

1259
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,440
you sign up to be a trustee uh because

1260
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,880
of the nature of trust trustees

1261
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,800
literally own the trust they are the

1262
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,760
owners of all the assets of the trust

1263
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,040
and they are

1264
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,559
themselves uh

1265
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,079
their personal liabilities are

1266
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,599
intertwined

1267
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,319
with the uh the trust and its assets and

1268
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,400
the activity so if the trust gets sued

1269
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,480
uh one of the consequences of trustees

1270
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,880
themselves can be named as part of the

1271
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,880
the suit so we hear a lot of good

1272
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,960
insurance on that to protect the people

1273
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,960
that volunteer to become trustees

1274
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,720
all trustees are not compensated they're

1275
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,400
all volunteers

1276
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,480
and we've run into a problem the last

1277
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,400
few years we've tried to increase the

1278
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,720
amount of coverage uh through our

1279
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,520
insurance broker uh to a level that is

1280
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,000
appropriate for both inflation and the

1281
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,160
legal risk that we see in the landscape

1282
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,880
the trouble is that uh the market for

1283
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,839
insurance providers for trusts uh really

1284
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,160
is very limited uh there's a very few

1285
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,599
companies that provide it

1286
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,119
and those that do provide like the one

1287
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,559
we currently use aren't interested in

1288
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,880
increasing the limits uh part of this is

1289
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,640
because the trusts are very often these

1290
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,000
days used for other activities such as

1291
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,160
real estate holdings uh generational

1292
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,799
wealth management uh tax

1293
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:38,319
efficiency uh and not so much use for

1294
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,720
uh what we do protecting you know the

1295
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,599
the ip materials for the itf and the

1296
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,920
other parties that we work with so this

1297
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,359
has created a problem for us we we've

1298
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,880
been scratching our heads about how to

1299
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,960
uh deal with this for the last few years

1300
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,599
and uh so we're looking at the landscape

1301
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,599
and maybe making some changes to the itf

1302
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,559
trust structure

1303
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,799
relating to this is as i mentioned the

1304
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,599
individual trustee liability um

1305
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,119
the current structure of the trust

1306
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,200
because the trustees themselves own the

1307
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,359
trust and all the assets they themselves

1308
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,680
take on a lot of legal liability and in

1309
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,920
fact when you become a trustee

1310
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,920
we give you a document that says hey

1311
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,760
read this over and by the way don't just

1312
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,240
read this and sign it quickly read this

1313
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,640
over it has a lot of stuff you are

1314
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,760
taking on

1315
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,680
and uh you know anecdotally we know

1316
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,119
there are people within the itf

1317
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,520
community that have seriously considered

1318
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,799
being a trustee

1319
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,280
looked at this and said oh no no no

1320
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,880
that's uh i'm not going to take on that

1321
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,440
personal liability um for myself the

1322
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,119
risk is just too high

1323
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,920
and so we've been sort of trying to

1324
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,760
figure out the path forward given these

1325
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,640
two key issues that are causing us

1326
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,400
you know personal liability

1327
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,240
making our pool of trustee candidates

1328
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,359
smaller

1329
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,319
and

1330
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:53,680
proper insurance levels to make sure the

1331
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,000
ones that do get selected and served are

1332
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,359
well protected

1333
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,359
and one of the things we've observed is

1334
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,960
that while trusts have a lot of these

1335
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,920
problems

1336
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,720
uh corporations don't

1337
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,000
and

1338
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,079
it breaks down to the corporations have

1339
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,960
within the legal frameworks uh that they

1340
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,720
operate under more protection for

1341
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,000
directors because directors aren't

1342
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,240
owners they're just demoted to

1343
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,079
uh from the owner down to a person

1344
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,240
serving to help run the corporation

1345
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,200
and uh they have more legal liabilities

1346
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,640
that help

1347
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,280
them along with there's a very large

1348
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,319
insurance market that will provide

1349
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,359
insurance coverage to such entities

1350
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:32,319
so

1351
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,799
we're exploring the possibility of

1352
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,920
restructuring the ihf trust on a legal

1353
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,960
basis

1354
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,440
into a not-for-profit corporation from a

1355
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,640
trust

1356
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,680
now

1357
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,839
in reality very little would change

1358
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,400
awkwardly if we did this right all the

1359
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,000
trust's current assets would just

1360
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
transfer over to the new entity

1361
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,839
all the current licenses we do and the

1362
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,200
way we do them and the way we make them

1363
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,720
available for people to use would all

1364
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,079
transfer as well

1365
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,079
we're going to demo the trustees though

1366
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,480
they get demoted to just be directors no

1367
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,079
longer would they be owners

1368
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,160
uh and we would also move from virginia

1369
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,240
uh probably to delaware where the united

1370
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,680
states is very popular to doing

1371
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,920
corporations um

1372
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,240
the itf llc for instance is in fact uh

1373
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,240
based in delaware

1374
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,359
uh

1375
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,799
what would not change

1376
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,680
the role and service to the itf and all

1377
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,119
the other communities that make use of

1378
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,359
the trusts assets would not change in

1379
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,400
any way

1380
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,559
licenses would stay the same and we

1381
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,559
would continue to be a 501c3 entity so

1382
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:33,839
non-profit

1383
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:35,119
as well the other thing we're not going

1384
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,880
to change is how the trustees are

1385
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,960
selected uh or in this case the new

1386
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,200
directors would be selected uh there

1387
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,400
would be still be five of them the

1388
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,079
selection process would still follow the

1389
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,359
process you know by 80 uh rfc 87

1390
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,559
14

1391
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,040
um but it was just the legal definition

1392
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,720
of how we're registered as an entity

1393
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,280
that would basically trust it changed

1394
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,200
so that's pretty big delay in the

1395
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,480
community

1396
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,440
um

1397
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,040
there's an obvious question why don't we

1398
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,760
just fold this under the itf llc we went

1399
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,960
all the work

1400
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,839
in

1401
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,319
uh you know to create it uh why don't we

1402
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,319
just fold over and i won't go into this

1403
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,359
slide in detail but there are

1404
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,400
some dependencies upon the trust being

1405
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,359
an independent entity uh that has been

1406
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,359
established from the very beginning uh

1407
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,079
and along with some requirements that

1408
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,119
uh because the llc is associated with

1409
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,040
isak as a

1410
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,160
um

1411
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,720
as an entity uh officially you know

1412
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,000
disregarded uh entity by eyestock um

1413
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,119
transferring the assets of the trust to

1414
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,359
the llc would effectively be given an

1415
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:42,319
arms

1416
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,280
uh length relationship to isoc

1417
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,040
and both the original founding agreement

1418
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,559
from 2005

1419
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,559
had a particular restriction that that

1420
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,440
can't be done with the trust's assets

1421
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,440
uh and then later on in 2016 when we did

1422
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,920
the ia transition and the trust took on

1423
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,400
some service diana and i can communities

1424
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,960
uh that was done with the expectation

1425
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,359
that the trust was an independent entity

1426
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:06,640
so we've looked at this we don't think

1427
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,359
this is an option

1428
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,440
so we've

1429
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,960
been looking at this we've been

1430
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,880
consulting with attorneys and so we're

1431
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,559
going to do is the following we are

1432
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,480
going to open up a consultation with the

1433
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,240
communities that make use of the trust

1434
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,240
this includes the itf

1435
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,839
i can uh the ir rars

1436
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,400
we're going to use the tlp interest list

1437
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,559
over the idf.org

1438
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,559
for comments and questions and we're

1439
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,119
going to hold a multi-hour webinar in

1440
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,200
april uh for anybody's interested in

1441
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,040
this topic to come and talk

1442
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,480
we're going to explain why we're

1443
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,839
thinking of what we're going to do how

1444
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,440
it would look and then open for

1445
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,839
discussion uh you know opinions concerns

1446
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,319
ideas uh we want to hear from people

1447
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:49,520
we're not just going to go off and do

1448
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,599
this you know in a vacuum uh this is a

1449
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,640
community conversation to have uh to

1450
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,799
figure out what the right path forward

1451
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:59,280
uh for the the trust and for the assets

1452
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,119
that managers are

1453
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,799
and with that

1454
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:05,359
here's how you can contact us in general

1455
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:08,640
and i will pass it on to

1456
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,520
lars

1457
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,079
thanks glenn this is again very hot uh

1458
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,760
thank you and we're coming to the

1459
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,240
recognition of the outgoing leadership

1460
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,520
part of the

1461
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,760
um

1462
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,920
agenda and jared will be happy to hear

1463
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,920
that the the rumors of my diminishing

1464
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,000
eyesight are vastly over exaggerated but

1465
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,920
my glasses do up when i wear a mask

1466
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,680
so i actually did not see that thing on

1467
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,119
the slide earlier

1468
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,559
i'm very sorry but everybody's paying

1469
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,599
attention that's great um right

1470
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,690
first up is the outgoing iab members

1471
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,559
[Music]

1472
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,119
yeah and we have um two outgoing ib

1473
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,960
members that i would like to to thank

1474
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,200
for a service today both of them have

1475
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,880
served for two years

1476
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,799
on the iab so they have been fully

1477
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,280
virtual iep members

1478
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,240
um

1479
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,359
i think that was challenging and i i at

1480
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:01,599
least had still a good time working with

1481
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:02,400
them

1482
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,039
i would like to start with jared because

1483
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,119
he is actually here in prison so at

1484
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,200
least i had finally a chance to meet him

1485
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,440
in person after two years of only online

1486
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,480
meetings

1487
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,640
um we had a couple of chats online as

1488
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,400
well so i do have the feeling i actually

1489
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,359
know you well but it's not the same

1490
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,599
um and so i'm happy that we at least met

1491
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,680
at this very last meeting

1492
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,240
um i think um despite the challenges we

1493
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,079
had the last two years with the wichita

1494
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,079
virtual setup it was great to have you

1495
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,760
on the iab

1496
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,200
you have strong opinions very often but

1497
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,599
but it's uh it's good to have different

1498
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,559
angles and and we had some discussions

1499
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,520
uh we we do agree on a couple of points

1500
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,920
but sometimes also disagree and it's

1501
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,920
very important for the iab to have all

1502
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,680
these different views in the discussion

1503
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,839
and make sure we represent in this way

1504
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:55,200
also a little bit the community

1505
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,799
so in order you will to remember your

1506
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,480
time at the ibb we brought you a little

1507

1530
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,520

1546
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,920
worked with him as well and ben

1547
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,000
has written some of the best uh short

1548
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,480
reports from the isg from the iasg and

1549
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,960

on what the isg is doing

1551
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,160
and they're so good that i actually

1552
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,680
internally forward them to my boss and

1553
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,680
say this is what i did this week and

1554
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,039
there's always like three things that i

1555
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,119
forgot about but ben didn't forget it he

1556
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,559
put them in it's a nicely bulleted list

1557
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,720
and it's been extremely useful in

1558
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,839
whoever we get and we need we need that

1559
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,839

this job and some of you uh remotely

1572
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,760
have done this job and you know it's

1573
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,799
often

1574
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,760

1575
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,799

1577
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:37,599
when the open mic later on gets boring

1578
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,680
maybe take a minute and send them a

1579
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,240
message and thank them for their service

1580
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,240
because while it can be you know not

1581
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,559
often fun to argue with an ad who has

1582
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,799
requests for you as an author i think

1583
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,559
that the reviews actually do help make

1584
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,960
the documents better and we need people

1585
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,359
like that are willing to serve and

1586
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,680
ask to hide questions and do the work so

1587
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,550
thank you very much ben and my turn

1588
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:05,839
[Applause]

1589
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,760
and with that i want to pass over to

1590
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,000
john

1591
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,039
me the um you can actually just forward

1592
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,359
it too either way

1593
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,640
i think i'm giving you control

1594
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,119
yeah there we go

1595
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,440
so

1596
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:30,960
susan

1597
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,799
r harris

1598
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,720
it was always susan

1599
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,240
never sue and the r is really important

1600
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,799
because she worked with both susan hares

1601
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:43,039
and another susan harris

1602
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:46,480
so susan r harris she passed away

1603
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,920
on march 6 after a short and um and

1604
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,599
she'd probably have said inconvenient

1605
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,480
battle with cancer

1606
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:59,839
susan was an outstanding writer and nerd

1607
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:02,000
whisperer

1608
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,319
and

1609
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,160
in the days before

1610
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,920
everyone knew that of course the

1611
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,760
internet was going to be a big deal

1612
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,799
she was instrumental in explaining it to

1613
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,480
decision makers who

1614
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,559
needed to know that this was important

1615
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,400
stuff

1616
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,039
she played a key part in getting nanog

1617
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,640
off the ground

1618
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,520
as it evolved from the earlier nsf net

1619
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,240
regional text group

1620
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,119
she authored a number of important rfcs

1621
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:34,240
notably the dao of iatf the discussion

1622
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,839
list charter

1623
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:39,520
her license plate was rfc 3005

1624
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,319
the guidelines for conduct

1625
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,440
her keen skills as a writer

1626
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,839
and editor were complemented

1627
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:50,960
by her

1628
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,160
dry self-deprecating wit

1629
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,200
and her generosity of spirit

1630
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,960
she was a good co-worker collaborator

1631
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,240
colleague

1632
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,720

but that's not why i got up i wanted to

1661
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,120
talk about the um

1662
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,759
a bit about the ietf endowment

1663
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,839
for a moment the um

1664
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:27,520
we are now

1665
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,600
for several meetings had an option on

1666
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,679
the registration to donate a little

1667
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,719
money to the ietf and

1668
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,158
i've been doing that for the last few

1669
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,238
meetings and since it's been available

1670
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:39,600
and it's an easy way to chuck a few

1671
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,759
extra bucks there and i was talking with

1672
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,600
lee berkeley during the hackathon and

1673
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,439
she said now that money is going to the

1674
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,080
endowment so it's getting the benefit of

1675
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,238
the matched funds from isoc

1676
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:52,640
so i just wanted to encourage everybody

1677
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,120
to take advantage of that it's just easy

1678
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,280
check check the box whatever put in a

1679
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,679
put in however much you can throw at us

1680
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,400
and continue supporting the ietf

1681
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,480
financially as well as technically

1682
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,718

1683
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,640
thank you perry that was that was great

1684
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,920
um i didn't hear a question but that's

1685
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,239
okay

1686
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:20,000
um do we have somebody else queuing up

1687
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,840
i don't think so

1688
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,000
okay this was very short thank you very

1689
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,360
much

1690
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,199
up next is the isg

1691
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,880
and this is where you hand over the dots

1692
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,679
so i think that might be the next slide

1693
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:38,560
no but we'll do it anyway um i have a

1694
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,880
role so so if you're misbehaving you

1695
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,480
might also get stuck with one of these

1696
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,280
later on in the bar but for now we have

so i just like to comment one of the

1845
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,159
things that's always a

1846
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,920
unique challenge is there's a lot of

1847
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,239
positions the iab does end up appointing

1848
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,040
for

1849
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,400
and so

1850
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,520
definitely

1851
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,480

1852

1853
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,719
questions well about stuff

1854
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,080
so we're always looking you know we've

1855
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,679
always been looking for good candidates

1856
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,920
for many of the positions so if you have

1857
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,199
extra time

1858
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,360
please let us know

1859
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,960
yeah that's also a good point so it's

1860
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,679
like

1861
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:43,360
some of these positions we need very

1862
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,520
specified expertise so it's not like a

1863
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,679
huge set where you should drawing from

1864
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:50,000
and it's always hard to find a diverse

1865
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,800
set of candidates and also selecting

1866
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,719
people who might bring into

1867
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,480
some more diversity and so some of these

1868
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,640
sports so the more volunteers we have

1869
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,320
for any of these positions the better

1870
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,679
