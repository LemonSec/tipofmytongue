2
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,600
hello welcome everyone um it's time to

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,360
get started uh so uh it's uh

4
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,879
one of the first meetings we have in

5
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,600
this context with uh both

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,559
on-site and remote participation so

7
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,640
please bear with us as we learn also

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,159
through this process

9
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
uh german myself quite sure we are

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,240
participating remotely and we have

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,799
so-called local backup diego lopez which

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,520
uh

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,439
you can see in the room sitting uh next

14
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,640
to the screen

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,479
uh so in case um

16
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,479
there is some issues or we need to

17
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,159
handle anything happening in vienna um

18
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,400
we will rely on diego for that

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,880
um but the meeting will happen in

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,360
mythical uh see that uh everyone is

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,640
connected here we will use the um

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,439
uh the queue from the from miteco so uh

23
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,400
and we will synchronize um with the

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,280
queue in the room so this is energy

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,360
meeting for iitf

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
113

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
and we need to go through a bit of not

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,840
well slides before we go into the

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,479
agenda so intellectual property the iota

30
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,640
follows the ietf interdictory of

31

rules

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,960

the goals of the rtf

84
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,920
so to make it clear the iitf the rrtf

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
conducts research

86
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
it is not a standards development

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
organization

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,000
the iotf focuses on longer term research

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,159
issues related to the internet while the

90
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,879
parallel organization the ietf

91
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,120
focuses on short-term issues of

92
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
engineering and standards making

93
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,160
while the irtf can publish informational

94
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,400
and experimental documents in the rfc

95
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,120
series its primary goal is to promote

96
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,280
development of research collaboration

97
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
and teamwork in exploring research

98
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
issues related to internet protocols

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,560
application architecture and technology

100
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,080
if you want to have more information

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,800
will not have an in-depth technical

141
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
discussion on intern-based networking

142

to

171
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,000
reflect on this notion of network

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,080
digital twin and what research

173
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,479
could be associated to this topic so the

174
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
problem space research challenges

175
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
questions and directions

176
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,039
and in support to that we have also

177
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,960
shared on the mailing list but also on

178
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,800
the hdoc

179
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,599
we have a set of let's say questions to

180
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,160
drive the discussion and we welcome your

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
opinion on on those questions

182
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,440
finally uh according to the remaining

183
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,680
time we will have there is also

184
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
another topic we would like to uh to

185
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,240
have input on is the evaluation of

186
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,199
cooperating layered asean architecture

187
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,919
to include compute and data awareness

188
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,680
and lewis will be making this

189
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
presentation

190
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,400
this will also serve as a reflection on

191
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,199
the

192
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,039
so-called class so cooperative layered

193
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,199
asean architecture to understand a bit

194
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,800
what would be the further development of

195
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
this topic

196
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,000
in analogy or beyond energy

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,560
any comments from the participant on our

198
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,560
agenda

199
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,320
okay all good so let's continue

200
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,440
um

201
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,958
so in the research group stages

202
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,200
we have a few updates on the progress

203
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,120
for our documents

204
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,080
so in rnc poll

205
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,839
we have the intent-based networking

206
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,920
intern classification

207
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,640
so the irg member

208
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
needs to express their view on the

209
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
document this poll will end

210
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
april 14

211
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,839
14th so it's coming pretty soon

212
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,680
the next step will be to if this is

213
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,560
positive to proceed towards a ietf

214
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,399
conflict review so this is progressing

215
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
towards rbc publication

216
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,120
the second document

217
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
second document is in rsg review so this

218
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,720
is the step just before the rsd poll

219
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,560
it's intend-based networking concepts

220
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,399
and definition this is still under

221
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,680
progress

222
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
we received the review from the irg

223
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
member and this is going through

224
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,000
interactions with the co-authors to

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
address the comments and then be able to

226
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
proceed

227
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,240
we have also recently adopted research

228
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,720
group documents digital twin network

229
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,279
concepts and reference architecture

230
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,600
so we will have also more insight on

231
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,959
this document

232
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,959
during the technical topic later on in

233
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
this session

234
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
also you may have seen on the mailing

235
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,720
list we have

236
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,959
started a call for a research group

237
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,480
document adoption

238
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,399
for the document network measurement

239
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,519
intent which is one of the ibm use cases

240
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,800
of nmrg

241
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,360
the call for research group adoption

242
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,640
will end april 8th and we welcome your

243
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,760
insight

244
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
on the

245
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
let's say value of these documents and

246
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,720
if it is ready to be considered as a

247
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,760
research group document

248
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,320
any comments on the status for this

249
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,800
argument

250
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,160
if not let me continue

251
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,040
as you may have seen in the agenda

252
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
for the topic on ibn we will not go into

253
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,720
in-depth technical discussion but we

254
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
wanted to

255
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,519
show that this this topic is also

256
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,240
progressing in a number of other groups

257
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,720
beyond irtf and ietf and that

258
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,640
there is more and more also

259
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,760
standardization open source but also uh

260
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,399
research activities on this topic

261
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,640
and this is just let's say a

262
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,279
a broad overview it's not exhaustive but

263
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,360
we hope it's still uh important for the

264
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,000
community in energy to be aware of those

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,399
uh of those other activities and

266
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,480
some of the research group participants

267
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
are already well connected to some of

268
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
those activities so we expect also to

269
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,279
have

270
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,160
collaborations in those contexts

271
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,519
so

272
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,519
what we have uh for other groups in 4r

273
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,360
in the linux foundation

274
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,519
the onapp project where there are

275
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,360
several ibn use cases being developed

276
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,079
and

277
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,720
part of the different honor premises

278
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,800
the link provided you can see

279
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,079
let's say it's an overview of the

280
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,680
different intent-based networking use

281
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,079
cases

282
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,320
appearing in the different releases and

283
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,880
by browsing on the on up wiki looking

284
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,800
for internet base you can find those

285
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
different use cases and more details

286
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,880
about who is involved and the exact

287
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,440
topic but it's interesting to see that

288
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,959
since several years

289
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,720
onap is continuously pushing to have

290
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
intern-based networking use cases also

291
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,399
being part of

292
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,160
the technologies developed in onap

293
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,760
in in etsy

294
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,839
the zerotouch network and service

295
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,160
management isg

296
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,040
and hello uh i'm sorry diego has been

297
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,560
recently i point

298
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,120
as a new uh chair of this isd so if you

299
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,639
have any questions on this group you can

300
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,800
also turn to diego

301
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,399
but there are a couple of activities

302
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,040
also in this isg related to intern-based

303
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,560
networking so there is a group report uh

304
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,959
group report 11 which targets

305
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,160
intern-driven autonomous networks it's a

306
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,000
study to try to understand the different

307
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,360
definitions uh techniques and mechanism

308
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,760
of intent uh driven aspects

309
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,240
in relationship to zero touch management

310
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,480
and this document is uh triggering a lot

311
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,639
of interesting discussions so

312
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,360
i invite you to to try to read it it's a

313
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
part of an open

314
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,160
open draft it's publicly accessible and

315
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,440
there is also

316
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,920
a proposal for a proof of concept on

317
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
automation of intent based plus lead

318
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,240
line service this is proposal by members

319
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
of this isg

320
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,920
about using the zsm specification

321
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
in the specific context of intern-based

322
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,040
clause

323
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,880
line service

324
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,360
in the itu you have also

325
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
a focus group on autonomous networks and

326
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,360
in this

327
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,279
focus group there are a set of

328
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,920
activities

329
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
which include

330
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,959
use cases or poc also related to intent

331
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,279
based not all the activities are related

332
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,040
to internet but you can find a few of

333
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,760
them

334
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
and um the main document you can find is

335
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,240
uh on the poc and proposal for builder

336
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,360
tone

337
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,279
where you can see the latest

338
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,440
teams willing to propose activities

339
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,600
related to that as part of the focus

340
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,519
group activities

341
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,680
finally you have also the at the tm

342
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,880
forum

343
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,120
autonomous network project

344
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,720
they have an interesting set of

345
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,120
documents uh addressing specifically

346
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
intern based networking uh so for

347
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,959
instance uh ig 1253

348
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,360
uh intent in autonomous networks you can

349
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,440
find the latest draft it's you just

350
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
think i think to have a login on tmf

351
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,199
to access it

352
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,360
but it's also part of a broader

353
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
set of documents

354
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,760
which i will quickly show

355
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,120
and this is an interesting development

356
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,880
because they have as you see

357
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,720
several aspects they really want to

358
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,440
specify relate in relationship to intent

359
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,120
so the document i was mentioning is the

360
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,199
one here in the middle but you see that

361
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,279
they want also to go into

362
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,199
more modeling aspects

363
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,519
different capabilities api development

364
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,760
etc and this is ongoing activities as

365
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,279
part of this

366
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,519
autonomous networking project

367
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,000
which i think is a very interesting

368
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
development

369
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,440
more on the say uh events or research

370
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,320
side

371
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,800
there are also a number of um

372
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
activities ongoing again this is not

373
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
exhaustive this is just

374
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
some information i like to share with

375
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,920
the research group

376
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,760
so there is a second edition of the

377
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,920
workshop on intern based networking that

378
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,639
will be in conjunction with ieee netsoft

379
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,000
in june in italy this year

380
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,920
and there is also a plan to have a

381
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,320
dedicated tutorial

382
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,519
on building use cases based on the tmf

383
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,079
specification for intel that i just saw

384
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:30,959
before

385
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,480
so i think this could be an interesting

386
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
experience for also researching

387
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,600
participants

388
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,839
to really have a more practical use of

389
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,000
intern-based networks

390
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,199
also

391
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,680
more and more papers and special issues

392
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,320
in the literature again this is just an

393
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,959
extract of some of the recent paper

394
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,240
essentially published last year

395
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,320
as you can see different special issues

396
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,759
in different um

397
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,920
different journals but also some

398
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,040
articles either survey type of articles

399
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,839
or dedicated approaches for a global

400
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,360
view on them

401
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,800
on intern based networking

402
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,720
so i hope you find this information

403
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
useful of course everything is available

404
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,440
offline if you want to have more insight

405
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,720
on those on those documents

406
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
and finally um

407
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,759
for for this part of the meeting

408
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
an emergency research group stated

409
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,639
future meetings um

410
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
the main thing we will have upcoming

411
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,199
will be let's say a series of interim

412
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,839
dedicated meetings especially for

413
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,720
follow-ups on the intern based use cases

414
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,240
we will have also

415
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,759
currently discussing with some of the

416
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,240
research group participants and beyond

417
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,279
about

418
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,000
proposal for dedicated interim meetings

419
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,639
on specific topics one is about

420
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,480
designing deploying and operating

421
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,639
distributed ais

422
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,240
we have received a

423
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,880
draft on this on this notion it's also

424
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,679
linked to the ai document there could be

425
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,160
also two interesting projects so we are

426
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
trying to see how to organize something

427
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,720
meaningful

428
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
proposition from the research group to

429
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,280
have a good discussion on this topic

430
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,000
um we will see what will come but we try

431
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,480
to have something before the summer uh

432
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,919
on this in the next let's say um

433
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,640
plenary meeting uh

434
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,760
currently we plan to go to uh the next

435
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,000
ietf but this remains to see the

436
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,720
feasibility

437
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,679
okay this one

438
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,760
you should have skipped it

439
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,880
and

440
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,200
that's it

441
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,080
jerome i think uh you'd like to take

442
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,639
over now

443
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,799
yeah so

444
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,600
if there is any um comments or questions

445
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
what you're presenting before we

446
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
continue

447
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,320
if not yes

448
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,440
i will continue

449
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,440
okay

450
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,360
this one

451
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,799
okay all right um

452
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,960
so yeah the next um

453
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,000
um

454
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,840
next item on the island was to give you

455
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,240
a status up with the um document

456
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,760
regarding the

457
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,400
um ai research challenge

458
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,240
uh for network management um

459
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,760
so um

460
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,559
i i i will give you an update and from

461
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,960
the previous um previous version that he

462
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,280
was was a version three

463
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,720
um

464
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,960
so i know that this document was here

465
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,520
for a while we so this document just

466
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,960
maybe to to to make it clear for uh

467
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,160
uh is a shared document that we work

468
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,480
collaboratively but it's not uh it is

469
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,640
just a google document actually

470
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,280
um we we thought that it was better to

471
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,799
work on it

472
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,840
um

473
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,000
so approximately what i would say is

474
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,960
that

475
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,679
not exactly one year ago but almost one

476
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,000
year ago we decided to

477
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,520
first

478
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,600
freeze the challenge the challenges

479
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,280
where we want to

480
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,640
document in this document actually

481
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,039
this was a temporary freeze because of

482
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,960
course we are not saying that we will be

483
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,120
exhaustive to have whole challenges

484
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,280
because we may miss some some of them

485
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
there will be news that can also came

486
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,640
out

487
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,799
due to some context and so but at least

488
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,559
we wanted to freeze it in order to

489
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,880
really progress and because at that time

490
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
we have some bullet points for

491
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
challenges we have some idea a lot of

492
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
ideas actually but not something very

493
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,760
strict

494
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,200
so we

495
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,720
have presented this list and then we

496
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
have asked uh

497
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
some particular contributors we were

498
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,000
quite willing to to lead the first

499
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,240
with me to try to

500
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,720
consolidate all the input we got

501
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,880
regarding the different challenges so we

502
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,559
define templates that you can see

503
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,240
basically here we try for each challenge

504
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,640
have some motivation a very quick state

505
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,720
of the art not uh not a big

506
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,880
in-depth survey but at least the quick

507
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,760
uh survey regarding uh the challenges

508
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,360
and in patera twilight what are the

509
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,120
remaining problems because

510
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,960
in many cases we have already tried to

511
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,520
use ai for the challenges it works it

512
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,679
does not work well and so on and try to

513
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,600
highlight what i mean the remaining

514
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,000
problem and maybe some really recent

515
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,840
results or orientations that we could

516
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,120
investigate um tobias i think it was

517
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
very quite successful because we had a

518
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,799
lot of challenges that were well

519
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,200
documented uh so i really want to thank

520
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,000
uh

521
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,080
to thanks all the contributors here

522
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,679
let's say editors that helped me to put

523
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,640
that in the more let's say a nice way at

524
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,840
the time

525
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,159
we have we had

526
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,640
let's say quite um

527
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,240
let's say detailed description of the

528
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
challenges with a lot of references and

529
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,440
it was very good

530
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,600
to to structure a bit of the id that you

531
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,760
put behind the challenge we have only

532
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,159
two challenges what we didn't had really

533
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,520
input was one what's about the

534
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,280
acceptability but actually

535
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,120
it's what i will call meta challenges

536
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,880
because we have some sub challenges that

537
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
are also related to acceptability i

538
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
don't think this is a big um the big

539
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,840
issue

540
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,679
and one is about the email in the loop i

541
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,440
think we had a lot of discussions that

542
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,919
we need to have the human into integrity

543
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,919
with ai even in our domain for network

544
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,679
for property network

545
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,039
and we actually have not really um

546
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,960
we did not really describe one of these

547
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,039
challenges at that time

548
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,520
and still today

549
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,799
so

550
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,120
based on that

551
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,679
i worked to prepare the four questions

552
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,720
uh i recently prepared to be honest um

553
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
so here you have the new link

554
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,000
uh the idea of this v4 was of course to

555
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,400
go over all the document and try to

556
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,280
again consolidate it so before after the

557
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,120
previous pass we have only we have

558
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,640
challenges which are well described but

559
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,320
of course it was description per

560
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,880
challenge so we need somehow to to

561
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,640
polish it to have something more current

562
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,240
or as a challenge

563
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,720
as object was also starting to identify

564
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,559
maybe some missing parts some missing

565
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,520
challenge

566
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,240
that we would need to integrate

567
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,880
and also try to also to identify some

568
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,280
key people or actions that we'll need to

569
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
progress in the document if we know

570
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,919
somebody is maybe an expert in this area

571
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,320
maybe you should reach which to help us

572
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
to elaborate the document and so on so

573
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,440
we try try order to identify some people

574
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,799
um

575
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,360
to to to help us

576
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
um so this is uh

577
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,320
what has been done from this v-formation

578
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,520
i will go a bit more into the details

579
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,960
um

580
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,480
so here was the initial list of

581
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
challenge that we have

582
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,039
that you had in v three so version three

583
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,120
so maybe as you remember we tried to

584
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,840
categorize a bit of challenges we had

585
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,080
four criterias one is more related to

586
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,320
problems that relate to the uh ai

587
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,039
technique itself uh saving other world

588
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,280
it's when for example we need to really

589
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,640
work on the

590
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,200
algorithm of method api to

591
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,960
fulfill the needs of a network

592
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,799
management problem a challenge

593
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,640
we have we have identified a lot of

594
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,080
problems looking to

595
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,559
data access to data or to present data

596
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,640
in a relevant way for

597
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
of needs

598
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,000
we have although seen that

599
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,760
there is actually one particularity of

600
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,000
our maybe our domain is that we also

601
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
want to you many cases want to use ai

602
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,799
not only to to to predict some value and

603
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,880
so but also to really take decision or

604
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,799
at least guide or help in decision or

605
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,240
take actions

606
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,720
does this make a bit the focus

607
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,520
is the constraint a bit different

608
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,640
and

609
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,720
also we had a lot of discussion at uh

610
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,919
regarding accessibility why we should

611
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:28,720
why

612
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,279
what would be the

613
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,799
the obstacle to to use ai for let's say

614
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,880
operating networks a lot of

615
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,640
issue we are used to

616
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,760
to have all procedures we cannot also we

617
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,480
don't want to let's say let an ai

618
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
automatically uh

619
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,320
around the network and so forth a lot of

620
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,960
discussion of course a lot of uh we had

621
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,880
we had this particular let's say

622
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,720
criteria of what i call it a challenge

623
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,039
but i know that's not a good term

624
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,360
anyway so we have this list as you can

625
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,200
see here are challenges from like the

626
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,440
yti data management and so on i will not

627
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,600
go for each of them of course it's not

628
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,520
the goal here

629
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
um but after the reviews what i call

630
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,120
here the review basically the review of

631
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,279
the three from b3 to v4 is that we just

632
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,120
observe that many of these challenges

633
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,799
which are the let's say the first column

634
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,200
here uh mostly are related to a single

635
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,960
let's say main

636
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,679
problem or let's say with a of course

637
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,760
for instance you can it can be the

638
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,200
challenge may be somewhat due to some

639
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,320
primary data maybe ai techniques

640
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,039
but anywhere we put that it's uh

641
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,880
it was still as you can see here we

642
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,400
tried to somehow

643
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,720
evaluate each other it was all

644
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,520
quite very focused and

645
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,600
it does not really make sense to

646
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,960
to try to

647
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,200
to let's say to to

648
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,960
first the challenges to be let's say

649
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,120
multi uh criteria maybe it's good just

650
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,200
to say we focus on what is the main

651
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,120
criteria that characterize the

652
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,799
challenges and we'll try to organize a

653
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,240
bit of document regarding that

654
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,919
and um

655
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:02,880
although

656
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,159
for the let's say ai for anim actions

657
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,240
actually it's mostly related maybe to

658
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,799
the ai technique that would run behind

659
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,760
it's some kind of a sub let's say

660
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,158
a sub level of the ai category

661
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,720
so this was the

662
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,039
our understanding after this between

663
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,960
this uh let's say internal reviews that

664
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,700
we did and um

665
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,559
[Music]

666
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,520
so very key it it turns into a new talk

667
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,039
a new table of contents that you can see

668
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,799
here on the left and on the right side

669
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,440
is there a previous tag

670
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,679
what is really important to see here is

671
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,760
that in previous document on the free

672
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,520
version we got this list of challenges

673
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,760
which were actually a big table where we

674
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,279
have one rule per changes we described

675
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,840
and though we just

676
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,120
um really a structure a bit based on the

677
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
different let's say categories so more

678
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,799
morality to the ai techniques that we

679
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,480
will need to

680
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,320
that needs to be

681
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,880
extended to be worked on

682
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,840
and

683
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,000
for network management and here you see

684
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,760
a list of five programs that comes

685
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,039
basically to the

686
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,279
to the challenge that you had before one

687
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,640
refers to the uh problem of how we can

688
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,480
um

689
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,720
precisely define a network management

690
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,679
program to be able to find the right uh

691
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,120
technical right set of techniques we

692
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,520
could use uh i mean ai techniques you

693
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,559
could use to to help us one is regarding

694
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,399
oh we evaluate the preference of produce

695
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,320
model not only from an ai perspective

696
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,520
from if we include some net let's say

697
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,720
network specific metric into the a

698
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,399
algorithm itself

699
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,200
and there is all we can email ai include

700
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,880
network or we can use ai to really um

701
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,640
the challenge of using ai for planning

702
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,159
uh actions

703
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,360
uh for uh operating network uh not only

704
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,399
distributed ai i will um i will go back

705
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,840
to this a bit a bit after because we

706
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,399
don't have actually we have it just as a

707
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,919
placeholder now but we don't have a

708
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,640
challenge really well described here

709
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,799
then we have all the things related to

710
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,440
the data

711
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,159
say that i've driven the data in ai

712
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,480
that we need maybe specific data in our

713
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,640
case or we collect data this is also

714
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,720
program it's not only on using data to

715
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,200
get data to extract knowledge uh to

716
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,440
share data maybe these are all of that

717
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,600
now included in this part

718
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,840
and then we have the acceptability of

719
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,600
ai how we can explain what has decision

720
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,919
of network a products or we can ensure

721
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,840
that when we have an ai or

722
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,440
prototype working in the lab environment

723
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,720
we can

724
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,399
what would be the challenge is not to be

725
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,760
sure that it would work in production

726
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,080
system or let's have some gravities so

727
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,880
now we have these new big big parts

728
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,720
three four fives here that basically

729
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
contains all challenges

730
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,320
um

731
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,640
then you can see that we keep as uh the

732
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,039
main section of the section that will

733
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,360
describe some very let's say what you

734
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,880
call difficult problems that you're

735
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,960
having network mirrors that could rely

736
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,440
on ai not uh

737
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,120
not always but that is that could be a

738
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,200
good uh good potential problem that you

739
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,480
should investigate with ai

740
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,320
but what you can see

741
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,080
what you can see here that's also some

742
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,840
other let's say

743
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,520
this structure has a bit simplified to

744
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,279
keep worries or focus on the equipment

745
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,840
on the challenges itself

746
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,480
so for instance um

747
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,559
except of course what i call what i have

748
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,559
described now with the respection of the

749
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,640
challenge uh we have removed some parts

750
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,080
we don't have any more use case parts um

751
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,320
so to maybe to recall it has never been

752
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,919
an objective for this document to list

753
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,720
some use cases and to have to detail

754
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,520
some use cases and we really insist

755
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,840
before to not fill out this section

756
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,799
before we are satisfied with let's say a

757
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,880
description of challenges

758
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,240
and i think for now it we could even

759
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,000
skip this part we don't have need to

760
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
have this use cases at that time i think

761
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,679
to have so the id now isn't about to go

762
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,440
to a more uh to reach a let's say a

763
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,799
first level version we don't need use

764
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,480
cases we have a lot of content that

765
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,200
which i think is really valued and very

766
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,320
valuable

767
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,720
so we assume that we should keep uh

768
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,640
at least for this first level version of

769
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,960
norfolk use on the challenges itself

770
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,600
anyway we have some let's say when it's

771
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,120
got challenge we give some illustrative

772
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,480
use case of

773
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,080
application of course it's not detail

774
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,320
use cases so we still in the document

775
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,159
it's not completely it's a

776
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,440
theoretical we still provide some

777
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,480
some example to highlight to show to

778
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,039
explain the different challenges so we

779
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,880
still have some more in line with the

780
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,640
challenges but not as really detailed

781
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,880
use cases with detailed procedures and

782
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,640
so on it's something that we

783
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,440
think we don't want now

784
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,039
um and also for directional

785
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,200
recommendations somehow this will be a

786
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,279
kind of another document i think if you

787
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,399
want also to really give and it's a very

788
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,480
specific orientation to

789
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,440
to

790
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,519
address this challenge or this challenge

791
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,000
will be will be nice but i think it's

792
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,880
also it would be a bit uh he will be

793
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,279
losing focus of the document

794
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,519
sorry i want to keep the the focus of

795
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,880
the google commands on main scope which

796
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,279
is our related challenges and

797
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,360
maybe later we can of course add

798
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,519
extension but at now i think we have a

799
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,519
lot of content that is really valuable

800
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,840
um

801
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,600
okay of course we have known an

802
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
introduction that the idea is to show

803
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,679
that we um that

804
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,480
the ai we cannot uh we cannot say we

805
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,159
will not use ai for network management

806
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,480
it does not mean that we will use ai for

807
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,919
everything network management but

808
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,200
somehow

809
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,039
it's something that we cannot avoid that

810
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,600
we need to have it

811
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,679
and that is we highlight that with some

812
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,679
let's say program that very briefly and

813
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,360
because we have a dedicated section for

814
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,519
that we try a little bit to disambiguate

815
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,159
between ai and machine learning here

816
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,000
the issue that most of challenges to be

817
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,919
honest were written with machine

818
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,760
learning in mind so

819
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,679
uh personally i try a bit to make it

820
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,000
more generic it's not always uh easy

821
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
because maybe some are really still very

822
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,919
machine learning oriented i think it's

823
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,159
not a problem but at least nutrition try

824
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:14,880
to

825
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,870
a bit uh let's say um

826
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,000
[Music]

827
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,159
uh disambiguate obviously

828
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,000
that we have it's not only about machine

829
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,559
learning there are so much homogeneity

830
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,360
challenges that can be let's say um

831
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,679
applied to different ai fields or there

832
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,120
are more let's say oriented to machine

833
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,960
learning so we try to i like that i

834
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,720
think this is not uh we are still

835
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
reviewing this part to be honest and

836
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,320
i hope that we come up with a nice nice

837
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,279
nice version then

838
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,399
um

839
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,159
we have this section about the difficult

840
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,919
products in network management so

841
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,760
previously we have a list of basically

842
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,440
bullet points we have a lot of problems

843
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,480
that uh

844
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,399
i think it was covered in documents so

845
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,240
everyone put bullet points and then we

846
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,159
try something to organize a bit

847
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,159
uh this uh this is a difficult problem

848
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,440
so i didn't have to give an exhaustive

849
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,279
list again here's to give some examples

850
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,640
that we could use maybe when you

851
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,799
describe channel and then so we try to

852
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,159
categorize them according to five uh

853
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,919
five criteria here as you can see

854
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,080
for example one is about the very large

855
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,240
solution space this is can

856
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,240
this can help to characterize a

857
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,159
difficult program some is related to

858
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,159
uncertainty appear on unpredictability

859
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,039
of

860
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,480
what will be the environment or the

861
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,640
context your assertion will be applied

862
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,679
some can be some or um guided by the

863
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,760
need to deliver solution in real time or

864
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,880
there are

865
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,039
a problem that already depending on data

866
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,200
of course when

867
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,279
maybe you will

868
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,399
need to analyze atr from

869
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,120
different problems and maybe if i'm not

870
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,279
i'm not personally a very

871
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,440
fan of that if that is about the um

872
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,880
the need to be intermittent you mind

873
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,360
processing i think this is not really a

874
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,679
this is not a something that comes

875
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,399
directly from

876
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,919
from the problems you want to tackle

877
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,040
that you need to be integrating the

878
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,280
human process just because it comes from

879
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,639
the procedures that you are not the

880
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,159
problem that you want to take so this is

881
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,320
something that is more let's say a

882
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,159
constraint that we had on top of

883
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,280
or let's say

884
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,918
our solutions but the problems you want

885
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,679
to to achieve for example here we have

886
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,719
some

887
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,599
example then below like a computation of

888
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,199
optimal classification of network

889
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,119
traffic if you don't need humans it

890
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,480
should be should be something possible

891
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,000
of course if

892
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,918
it's not always the case but it's not

893
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,679
let's say a constraint that comes

894
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,639
directly to the problem to to so

895
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,079
of course now we have only two problems

896
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,079
which are let's say described in a more

897
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,879
let's say a textual way uh we have this

898
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,320
list of bullet points that we still have

899
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,000
in the document so the ideas that you

900
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,719
would

901
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,599
uh

902
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,639
also

903
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,399
take some other and we'll try to detect

904
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,640
them as well

905
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,359
in this section

906
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,000
so what remain uh what mostly remain

907
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,960
because

908
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,040
i would say that there is the first

909
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,880
issue regarding the

910
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,760
humay in the loop challenges um

911
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,520
you see the current description is very

912
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,599
lightweight it's what is uh what is in

913
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,960
italic here

914
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,359
so i is the question is should we keep

915
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,440
it or should we um some or omitted in

916
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,880
the document um okay uh they said we

917
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,480
will not this is the goal is not to

918
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,880
provide a full list and exhaustive list

919
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,720
of challenges

920
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,560
um somehow

921
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,240
somebody's looking to come out nor these

922
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,480
are new organizations for each let's say

923
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,880
big category we have a kind of uh

924
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,040
introduction for each challenge related

925
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,040
to ai technique we have an introduction

926
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,359
trying to give a bit the scope of this

927
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,079
uh

928
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,800
all let's say sub challenges and the

929
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,560
let's say your human subcharge will be

930
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,800
part of let's say ia techniques probably

931
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,520
that that's most integrated as a human

932
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,079
so it can be somewhat in putting the

933
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,359
introduction

934
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,920
um but of course if you want them to

935
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,800
learn more let's say uh

936
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,599
this

937
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,760
detailed description will need

938
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,040
uh somebody here in the room from

939
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,920
otherwise that could help us in that

940
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,520
uh from my perspective i think uh we we

941
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,800
have a lot of discussions there are a

942
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
lot of contributing distributed ai but

943
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,920
we didn't really

944
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,440
use the document i think it would be

945
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,520
essential for us um

946
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,440
so being in my opinion we should need to

947
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,400
to a bit more despite this part as well

948
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,320
of course then you have a lot of other

949
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,760
let's say editorial parts we need to

950
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,520
complete introduction conclusion and so

951
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,760
on we need to

952
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,240
reference and so on um so

953
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,720
the ideas that were then to

954
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,480
i know that i already promised a bit

955
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,680
before to

956
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,280
transfer these google documents let me

957
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,240
give you a draft something that

958
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,400
is just in my mind i hope that you'll be

959
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,480
able to to try this music document and i

960
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,640
created with everything

961
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,520
really for me

962
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,760
uh also all to progress now so uh to

963
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,599
know we have lost a lot of contributors

964
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,880
it was really great we had a lot of the

965
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,480
id no i

966
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,560
i would like to go with a smaller

967
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,119
equatorial team uh to be with maybe more

968
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,200
let's say a focus team really working on

969
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,119
the world document not only on specific

970
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,800
challenge

971
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,520
to um

972
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,880
uh to uh totally uh do this let's say uh

973
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,800
to do all the editorial paths to all

974
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,119
music elements and so on and to i think

975
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,480
it would be very important so as we

976
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,760
already discussed we can put all

977
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,359
contributors out towards the draft so

978
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,599
that we need also to

979
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,760
to to to to restrict the list to some

980
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,359
this low number of people and of course

981
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,599
all contributors will be listed

982
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,680
uh as contributors and acknowledgement

983
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,520
sections for sure

984
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,640
um

985
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,320
after the review of the document this is

986
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,400
a small dot our team will really be an

987
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,079
important challenge we will make some

988
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,720
change and hopefully mid-may will

989
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,440
be able to deliver nice documents that

990
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,520
we got for review from everybody but of

991
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,440
course as a link is open

992
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,200
if anyone is already interesting to give

993
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,599
you to give us some comments

994
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,520
it's really it's really open so do not

995
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,200
hesitate

996
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,680
and to already write comments before

997
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,480
and yeah that's it for me

998
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,520
any comments or questions

999
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,240
yes

1000
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
i have a question if you go back a

1001
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,599
couple of slides when you have the the

1002
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,520
criteria for the electric management

1003
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,280
problems

1004
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,079
yes here

1005
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,119
i like your approach

1006
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,520
what i'm

1007
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,680
for the document itself

1008
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,359
what what do you intend to describe

1009
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,320
really a series of problems i mean what

1010
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,240
will be the focus of the of this section

1011
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,320
and document uh it will be more on the

1012
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,240
criteria or it will be more on trying to

1013
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,200
find some problems that uh that have the

1014
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,240
different criteria c1 to c5

1015
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,160
just to understand because i think see

1016
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,839
the criteria are quite interesting and

1017
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,000
pretty i mean uh transverse

1018
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,800
uh

1019
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,920
finding problems that have uh many of

1020
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,760
the criteria etc

1021
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,560
we will be kind of going again into uh

1022
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,359
not use cases but our problem is and

1023
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,960
then it becomes a bit

1024
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,599
uh the question which one to select uh

1025
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,000
to be to be signific significant or

1026
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,400
representative of uh network management

1027
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,960
problems

1028
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,880
okay so um actually it was a bit in

1029
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,119
kind of let's say reverse engineering

1030
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,200
this criteria it was based off what has

1031
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,640
been already provided in terms of

1032
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,760
problems

1033
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,880
so yeah

1034
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
the idea of using this criteria is just

1035
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
to help us to um

1036
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,240
to try to

1037
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,200
somehow

1038
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,440
have yes i have problems that

1039
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,599
fulfill different materials many

1040
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,119
criterias

1041
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,560
the idea of the document of course is

1042
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,920
not the description of the problem

1043
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,800
itself but if you have some

1044
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,560
some problems that are used and in the

1045
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,920
chinese description we have already

1046
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,079
actually we have many many people and

1047
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,839
they contribute to describe challenges

1048
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,520
and they give an example for example

1049
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,480
and so

1050
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,839
the idea that we should take this

1051
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,280
example and put them in the first

1052
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
section and try of course this example

1053
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,880
because many examples are similar so

1054
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,359
they are quite transversal and try to

1055
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,319
show why is why this why these problems

1056
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,319
are very hard and we

1057
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,960
actually yeah this criteria should that

1058
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,160
should have to understand why they are

1059
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,880
very hard and then for each section you

1060
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,040
can refer to this to this let's say big

1061
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,520
problem when you describe why this is a

1062
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,119
challenge for example i don't know to

1063
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,119
use a lightweight ai in network uh for

1064
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,920
example because we have

1065
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,760
we need some out to the reverse relation

1066
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,280
constraining determinative type so we

1067
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,280
need the ai and working at like minutes

1068
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,800
we put so we put so so there is more to

1069
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,079
you to

1070
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,000
to help us a bit to to describe the

1071
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,480
problems and to really highlight that's

1072
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,160
a hard problem

1073
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,319
why because of this criteria and then we

1074
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,200
use these problems in as illustrative

1075
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,680
example and we can refer it in challenge

1076
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,240
description

1077
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,359
is that clear hello

1078
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,160
yeah thanks thanks for the clarification

1079
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,920
okay thank you

1080
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,240
i think we have olga in the line

1081
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,000
can you i just wanted to ask you are you

1082
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,079
looking at it as a kind of just

1083
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,640
challenges for the green field or do we

1084
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,800
have kind of some problems in regards to

1085
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,440
the integration with existing

1086
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,160
uh network management solutions

1087
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,520
uh sorry arka can you just repeat again

1088
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,319
and then

1089
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,560
i'm just wondering i'm looking at the

1090
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,400
challenges from the perspective of the

1091
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,800
greenfield ai based network management

1092
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,359
solutions or do we need to add maybe the

1093
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,720
challenges

1094
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,040
that we need to integrate

1095
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,839
or

1096
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,319
augment or expand the existing network

1097
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,800
management solutions

1098
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,090
uh

1099
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,960
[Music]

1100
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,800
i think there is no let's say let's say

1101
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,880
limit of challenges which what we could

1102
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,839
put um some more for the range of

1103
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,839
management of course um

1104
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:32,800
so

1105
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,480
yes we have challenges maybe to resolve

1106
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,160
some uh some problems that you have

1107
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,520
already today or maybe we want to

1108
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
integrate ei to solve new channels some

1109
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,280
new some new problems will have in

1110
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,960
network management so that you know we

1111
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,480
have already so this is not let's say

1112
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,000
it's not this let's say um

1113
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,160
fixed and of course if you if you need

1114
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
to extend it uh

1115
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,800
some solution with ai yeah it's also

1116
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,440
kind of a challenge that we should

1117
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,839
highlight but it must be i like it not

1118
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,599
not from a

1119
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,319
single problem perspective but more

1120
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,240
globally

1121
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,400
so so maybe i'm just thinking is there

1122
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,319
some criteria that is talking how to

1123
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,680
evolve

1124
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,560
uh the existing uh solutions and how to

1125
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,599
integrate the ai ml into the existing

1126
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,599
solutions

1127
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,920
i think this is part actually of the

1128
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,160
acceptability which is you you know it's

1129
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
acceptability uh

1130
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,920
main challenges and then you can accept

1131
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,920
challenges maybe this is a good

1132
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,440
challenge to have here

1133
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,839
um

1134
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,280
because if you have time to look at the

1135
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,040
document i try to

1136
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,560
to add this id that we have already

1137
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,560
procedures we have already solution we

1138
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
cannot just say from the from

1139
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,240
from today to tomorrow which change

1140
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,680
everything we need to

1141
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,760
to some way integrate incrementally ai

1142
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,079
this is something that i try to to make

1143
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,760
it uh

1144
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,079
appearing in the let's say acceptability

1145
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,119
challenges and then you have some

1146
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,680
challenges uh but here in the second one

1147
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,280
which is

1148
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,280
um

1149
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,920
in production system

1150
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,760
actually this is uh

1151
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,800
we move from let's say uh uh yeah lab

1152
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,560
solutions to solution in in the real

1153
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,800
real network let's say

1154
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,720
and yeah yes there are some some

1155
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,880
challenges and we try to to figure out

1156
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,040
what could be the orientation as well

1157
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,400
uh

1158
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,000
of course i think maybe we then have

1159
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,400
questions also so is there some uh you

1160
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,800
know session and then we will go to um

1161
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,480
so digital twins that's why i think it's

1162
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,319
also a possibility a research and

1163
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,040
digital should help to integrate ai

1164
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,040
incrementally into production system

1165
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,880
because you test it in uh yeah digital

1166
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,400
twins so this is something that appears

1167
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,920
as well here

1168
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,599
so um

1169
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,480
yeah

1170
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
your mark is fully valid so if you are

1171
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,160
interested by this i mean

1172
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,400
you can focus on this section and you

1173
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,480
can give me some feedback if you want i

1174
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,800
will be very happy to take you to

1175
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,520
just to know if this make uh

1176
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,520
this is uh i like what you have said

1177
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,040
before that uh

1178
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,079
how to

1179
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,920
you know extend existing solution with

1180
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,839
the eyes is an issue and

1181
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,440
maybe this should be

1182
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,160
your focus support yeah

1183
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,839
okay thank you

1184
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,640
okay any further questions to

1185
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,000
before we continue with our agenda

1186
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,480
we'll be on natural digital twins

1187
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,240
and the first presentation will be from

1188
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,400
uh jordy and alvarez hope to build a

1189
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,000
digital twin

1190
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,599
um

1191
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,240
albert you want to present

1192
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,640
i will present and you just tell me i

1193
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,520
want to switch right okay

1194
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,759
yeah okay

1195
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,200
here

1196
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,480
okay so uh i will start so um thanks for

1197
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,359
um

1198
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,680
i love for inviting me for for this talk

1199
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,000
i hope that you find it interesting so

1200
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,839
what we're going to talk is how you can

1201
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,839
build a digital twin and we will compare

1202
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,680
a bunch of technologies and we will try

1203
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,520
to understand what are the pros and the

1204
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,880
the cons so next slide please

1205
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,960
so this is a digital twin i think that i

1206
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,880
don't need to describe further the

1207
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,640
concept right it is a digital

1208
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,319
representation of a networking

1209
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,240
infrastructure

1210
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,760
and it has been documented already in

1211
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,400
drafts and many papers um and instead of

1212
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
focusing on on what is the digital twin

1213
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,920
we will focus more on how we can build

1214
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,480
it so next slide please

1215
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,119
so next one

1216
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,680
so i think that the the first question

1217
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,599
we need to answer ourselves whenever we

1218
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,359
want to discuss the digital twin and

1219
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,960
specifically when we want to discuss how

1220
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,400
to build it is

1221
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,319
what are the inputs and the outputs it's

1222
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,599
very hard to have a meaningful

1223
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,359
discussion on the digital twin on the

1224
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,280
network digital twin if we don't uh

1225
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,040
first of all discuss

1226
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,599
uh what if it's a box right if we agree

1227
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,760
that it's a box uh then it has some

1228
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,200
inputs and some outputs and that's the

1229
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,119
very first thing we need to agree on

1230
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,359
right and in particular that's a very

1231
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,119
very bad question if we want to discuss

1232
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,640
how we can build it and what are the

1233
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,200
challenges and also the use cases

1234
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,400
so uh next slide please

1235
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,319
so in order to answer the question how

1236
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,160
we can build a digital twin we have

1237
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,319
decided to go through for these inputs

1238
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,079
and outputs which are

1239
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,160
uh as inputs we have the network

1240
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,480
configuration which means this is my

1241
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,559
network topology i have this type of

1242
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,480
cues i have this type of

1243
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,440
scheduling policies like stick priority

1244
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,359
or weighted weighted circuiting i have

1245
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,520
this routing protocol i have an overlay

1246
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,079
routing protocol with segment routing

1247
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,200
and so on that's the network

1248
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,440
configuration for the traffic load is

1249
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,640
exactly

1250
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,960
which is what are the packets that are

1251
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,960
entering into my network right how many

1252
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,880
users i have which type of traffic they

1253
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,119
send do they send voiceover ip within

1254
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,280
demand or data traffic for backup

1255
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,440
traffic and so on so those are the two

1256
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,680
inputs and at the output

1257
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,599
what we propose is that it is the

1258
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,760
resulting network performance so if i

1259
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,839
have a network which has this particular

1260
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,839
configuration with that topology and

1261
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,000
this particular router equipment and

1262
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,599
switches and so on

1263
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,359
and i load it with this particular

1264
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,359
traffic this is the performance that i

1265
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,440
will get and the performance can be

1266
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,040
measured through

1267
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,760
what will be the delay of the flows

1268
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,920
from the users what will be the delay of

1269
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,480
the voice video on demand traffic how

1270
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,400
many losses i will have in my network

1271
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,920
what will be the link utilization what

1272
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,160
will be the utilization and so on

1273
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,920
it is very important to note that we are

1274
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,839
not claiming that those are the right

1275
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,319
inputs and outputs those are the ones we

1276
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,559
are considering in my group uh to answer

1277
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,079
the question how we can build it and to

1278
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,000
see which are the challenges ahead

1279
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,200
um

1280
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,359
and they are relevant for the sake of

1281
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,240
the discussion i think that uh

1282
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,839
those inputs and outputs can be

1283
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,280
challenged and we can have a discussion

1284
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,280
on whether those are not the right ones

1285
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,640
and maybe there are better ones that's

1286
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,160
fine i'm open to that

1287
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,000
but for this presentation let's keep and

1288
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,760
let's assume that those are the the

1289
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,359
inputs and outputs so next night please

1290
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,559
then how why these inputs and outputs

1291
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,200
make sense at least to me because

1292
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,800
if you take the a real network

1293
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,040
infrastructure and you assume it as a

1294
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,760
box also that's super stupid what i'm

1295
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,119
going to say okay

1296
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,559
because you guys are running networks

1297
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,400
and building them but let me explain

1298
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,000
them from this angle at the end a

1299
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,359
network if we assume that that's a

1300
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,359
transient network what you have is

1301
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,200
data packets that are getting into the

1302
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,880
network and data packets that are

1303
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,880
getting out the network right if that's

1304
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,319
uh that's a

1305
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,240
transiting network so we have traffic

1306
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,400
going from ingress to egress

1307
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,000
now these traffic are packaged but at

1308
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,280
the end they can be

1309
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,359
voice traffic video traffic and so on

1310
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:18,640
and then you have some sort of

1311
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,319
administrator which can be a network

1312
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,160
management platform or a controller

1313
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,760
which is applying a configuration to the

1314
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,280
network okay or the network is already

1315
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,720
configured the configuration is

1316
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,880
everything that it is you know on the

1317
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,119
configuration file of each

1318
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,839
and every uh network device

1319
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,599
and then if you have if you assume that

1320
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,040
you have some sort of telemetry platform

1321
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,280
what you have is a performance metrics

1322
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,200
so you can measure okay this is the

1323
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,520
delay for this type of flows this is my

1324
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,079
utilization this is my losses this is my

1325
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,040
link utilization okay so this is how we

1326
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,520
see a network of course not all some

1327
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,359
networks consume and produce traffic

1328
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,520
this is not shown here but for the sake

1329
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,040
of the discussion i think that this is a

1330
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,880
good example because this can be changed

1331
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,160
later on so next slide

1332
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,240
so then what the performance network

1333
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,359
digital twin is is exactly the same it's

1334
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,079
it's the the box is representing your

1335
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,680
network infrastructure

1336
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,200
you are applying exactly the same

1337
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,800
configuration to the performance network

1338
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,319
digital twin exactly the same as you

1339
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,640
have in the real network but instead of

1340
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,240
using the real traffic to test the net

1341
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,079
the network digital twin

1342
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,400
you input a description of the traffic

1343
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,160
okay because it's not a real network so

1344
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,839
you don't put packets into the digital

1345
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,240
twin but you put a description

1346
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,400
on how this packet looks like how many

1347
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,599
flows do i have how many voice of video

1348
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,440
on demand flows i have which is the rate

1349
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,359
for this video on demand flows um how

1350
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,880
many users i have which is the

1351
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,280
the dynamic behavior temporal behavior

1352
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,040
of the users because maybe at night i

1353
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,480
have more traffic than during the day

1354
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,920
because that's a residential network and

1355
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,480
so on so those are the two inputs to a

1356
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,480
network digital pin okay and then the

1357
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,559
output is are not the package because we

1358
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,160
are not putting packets into the digital

1359
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,680
pin what we are putting is a description

1360
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,040
of the traffic and what we get is a

1361
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,400
description of

1362
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,640
what will be the performance

1363
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,720
of that network

1364
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,359
if um of for that traffic with this

1365
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,119
particular configuration right so again

1366
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,520
so it's uh for the the network this is

1367
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,280
doing is simulating let's say

1368
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,200
a network which has what has been

1369
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,040
configured with this configuration has

1370
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,480
this type of traffic and then it will

1371
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,000
tell you okay this is the performance

1372
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,359
you will get okay so next slide please

1373
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,680
so next one

1374
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,599
so i don't want to discuss which are the

1375
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,760
use cases of a performance digital twin

1376
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,280
i don't think that that's the focus of

1377
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,800
this presentation

1378
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,680
but i think that it is very hard to

1379
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,520
to to have a meaningful discussion on

1380
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,520
how you can build something if we don't

1381
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,599
see why that's relevant right so let me

1382
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,160
go super quickly over a few use cases

1383
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,760
so basically a performance network

1384
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,559
digital twin it's it's it's a useful

1385
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,720
tool because if you think about any kind

1386
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,480
of automation

1387
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,119
before an automatic system an autonomous

1388
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,800
system decides what to do with the

1389
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,720
network it is very important that it

1390
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,000
understands

1391
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,839
what will be the impact

1392
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,920
if i change this right if i don't have

1393
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,599
if the autonomous system does not have a

1394
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,680
digital twin that will tell

1395
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,280
okay if you do this the performance will

1396
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,040
be bad so don't do it it's very hard for

1397
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,559
your autonomous system to decide what to

1398
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,760
do right

1399
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,760
so basically that's that's that's that's

1400
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,119
the main the main goal of our

1401
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,680
performance the network digital twin so

1402
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,920
here we have a set of use cases but on

1403
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,599
the paper listed below you have way more

1404
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,000
use cases you can check them

1405
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
for instance you can

1406
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,599
and i'm assuming here that this digital

1407
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,960
twin is deployed with a traffic

1408
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,480
telemetry platform i'm a network

1409
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,640
management platform which are not easy

1410
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,960
to implement or deploy but i assume that

1411
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,559
they are already there and that's out of

1412
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,960
the scope of my presentation but you can

1413
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,440
answer questions such as what if

1414
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,720
so let's say that i'm employed in a

1415
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
company i'm running the network and my

1416
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,480
company is thinking about acquiring

1417
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,559
another company so i can ask my network

1418
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,480
digital twin what will be the impact of

1419
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,400
the on the network load if i if we

1420
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,480
acquire that company if all these users

1421
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,559
are now using my network what will be

1422
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,160
the performance of my network what will

1423
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,839
be a linguistic

1424
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,400
or i can ask questions such as okay

1425
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,040
i have a 5g core and i have a backup 5g

1426
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,880
core but what will what will be the

1427
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,839
impact

1428
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,340
in the users if the um

1429
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,520
[Music]

1430
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,359
if one of the 5g cores fails and all the

1431
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:20,800
users need to be redirected to the

1432
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,880
backup one what will be the session

1433
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,960
establishing what will be the impact on

1434
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,520
the session establishment time and so on

1435
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,160
or you can ask questions such as okay

1436
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,880
can i support new user slas with exactly

1437
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,480
the same resources i do have or do i

1438
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,160
need to buy new network equipment or

1439
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,319
maybe i need to upgrade the link okay so

1440
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,200
um

1441
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,119
this is a set of use cases you have more

1442
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,319
on the on the paper if you are

1443
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:45,599
interested so next slide please

1444
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,599
okay so now we have uh at least we uh we

1445
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,440
will build a performance network digital

1446
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,799
twin and then we can discuss how we can

1447
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,680
build it okay so next slide

1448
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,000
so um in in what we have built is a

1449
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,359
performance digital twin as i was

1450
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,920
explaining and to be more specific the

1451
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,880
configuration that we assume is um

1452
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,880
we support topology okay which is a

1453
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,720
topology of the network we're assuming a

1454
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,960
fixed network with switches and routers

1455
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,040
which is the link capacity which is the

1456
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,079
routing that you're using on your

1457
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,359
network whether

1458
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,520
we support overlay routing like services

1459
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,839
or mpls or lisp and we support underlay

1460
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,119
routing also

1461
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,240
like very like ospf and pcp whatever you

1462
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,839
are using there what are the scheduling

1463
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,760
policy you are using uh any arbitrage

1464
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,359
scheduling policy will work like uh

1465
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,960
strict priority weighted securing

1466
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,599
deficit run robin and so on the q length

1467
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,000
um and then other features such as ecmp

1468
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,839
lag and so on i know that some of these

1469
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,720
features are very old and and

1470
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,559
and our goal is to academically show

1471
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,960
that whether this can be built then the

1472
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,480
real features i think it's up to

1473
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,319
discussion for people that have way more

1474
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,640
knowledge on how the industry works

1475
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,000
okay and the traffic load as i was

1476
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,520
saying you have the traffic matrix which

1477
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,440
is how much how much bandwidth i have

1478
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,599
from one ingress point to one egress

1479
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,559
point

1480
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,280
and then also we support flows meaning

1481
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,640
that we are assuming that the

1482
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,160
performance network digital tune will

1483
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,599
support flows meaning that we have this

1484
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,240
amount of flows that start here and here

1485
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,000
and then each flow has a different type

1486
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,480
of traffic like uh voiceover ip video on

1487
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,520
demand web and so on um and we don't

1488
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,599
need that these flows are described as

1489
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,760
five tuple we support any level of

1490
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,319
variety so for instance flow can be uh

1491
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,480
from from english to egress or you can

1492
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,559
assume any level of variety

1493
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:27,680
uh

1494
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,599
and and and this will will support it

1495
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,559
okay so next slide

1496
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,599
so now let's build let's try to build

1497
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,720
this box with a simulator okay so next

1498
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,160
slide please

1499
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,720
so here what we're doing is we're taking

1500
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,960
this box okay and this box is actually a

1501
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,040
simulator okay it's running c code or

1502
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,559
whatever language you're using and it's

1503
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,160
implemented using a simulator so next

1504
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,399
slide

1505
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,000
okay so we have actually we did that and

1506
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,920
for that we use the obnet plus plus

1507
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,839
simulator that's that discrete event

1508
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,400
simulator uh with basically a discrete

1509
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,079
event simulator what does it simulates

1510
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,599
the propagation transmission and

1511
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,000
forwarding of each and every packet and

1512
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,760
actually the forwarding of each and

1513
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,359
every packet is what is considered

1514
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,520
inside the simulator is a discrete event

1515
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,520
so basically a simulator is a code which

1516
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,480
is which

1517
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,799
takes all these events and you know goes

1518
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,079
through all of them

1519
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,640
and tries to understand what happens

1520
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,240
uh discrete event simulators are very

1521
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,480
well known in networking um there are

1522
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,880
way more discrete object is just one of

1523
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,799
them there are them and network

1524
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,400
simulator two and three g and three

1525
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,000
cisco packet three seven so there are a

1526
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,680
bunch of them but all of them they work

1527
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,280
under the same principle which is they

1528
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,440
simulate what happens with each and

1529
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,559
every packet

1530
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,880
so if you take one simulator and you try

1531
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,640
to build this kind of box you will find

1532
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,160
that the accuracy is very good now what

1533
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,839
is accuracy and this was one of the

1534
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,599
questions that jerome was sending to the

1535
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,960
list right

1536
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,200
but i couldn't see here i mean if i take

1537
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,400
a real network

1538
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,040
and i apply a configuration and i i load

1539
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,640
it with a certain amount of traffic and

1540
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,640
i measure in the real network what is

1541
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,720
the delay for instance for a particular

1542
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,680
flow

1543
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,000
and then i do the same with a simulator

1544
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,160
the difference between the the real

1545
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,680
delay measured at the network at the

1546
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,440
real network and the delay measured at

1547
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,880
the simulator that's what i call

1548
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,280
accuracy okay and the error the higher

1549
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,440
the error the the worse

1550
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,200
the the the less accurate is the

1551
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,680
simulator is this the technology

1552
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,599
so accuracy is very good in a simulator

1553
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,440
typically you get perfect accuracy or

1554
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,799
almost perfect accuracy um

1555
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,640
but what about the simulation time so

1556
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,880
next slide please

1557
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,480
so what happens is that although

1558
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,880
simulators are very accurate the problem

1559
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,400
is that the time it takes for a

1560
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,760
simulator to simulate a network

1561
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,240
it scales linearly with the amount of

1562
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,319
packets okay which are discrete events

1563
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,680
at the end of the simulator and if you

1564
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,200
think about how a simulator works this

1565
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,200
is exactly this is exactly right so for

1566
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,040
instance just to give you an idea

1567
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,280
one billion packets takes 11 hours in a

1568
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,880
quite busy computer

1569
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,760
and one one billion packets is roughly

1570
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,400
equivalent to one minute of a single 10

1571
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,720
gigabits per second link okay so if you

1572
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,160
want to simulate

1573
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,319
one minute of attenuate per second link

1574
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,559
this will take you 11 hours in a quite

1575
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,559
busy computer so of course

1576
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:15,280
it is uh impractical to simulate a real

1577
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,599
network which have tens of links which

1578
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,520
are even high with higher capacitance

1579
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,200
than 10 gigabytes per second it will

1580
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,480
take you a week to do that so although

1581
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,880
simulators are very accurate

1582
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,280
they are they have a huge computational

1583
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,599
cost and they are not practical because

1584
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,599
any question you ask to the digital twin

1585
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,920
it will take weeks to answer that

1586
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,240
uh and actually if if you want to

1587
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,319
simulate a real real network with real

1588
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,319
link capacities and real traffic

1589
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,319
it's not even weak it's probably more

1590
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,640
okay and you are spending huge amount of

1591
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,040
um computational cost so that's why i

1592
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,720
believe that using a simulator for that

1593
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,319
is not practical so next slide please

1594
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,880
okay now let's go to emulation so next

1595
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,079
slide

1596
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,880
so um what is an emulator so an emulator

1597
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,440
is if you take a network right a network

1598
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,760
is uh it is made a real network it is

1599
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,559
made out of two main components hardware

1600
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,079
which typically

1601
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,880
is designed uh specific for networking

1602
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,359
you have like network processors and

1603
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:18,079
asics and so on which are designed for

1604
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,440
packet processing

1605
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,880
and then the software which control

1606
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,119
which is runs over this hardware right

1607
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,040
so an emulator is basically taking and

1608
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,680
i'm

1609
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,040
sure that many of you already know that

1610
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,880
but let me go super quickly through it

1611
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,799
an emulator is taking only the software

1612
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,559
components of your network

1613
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,480
and running exactly the same software

1614
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,880
components or as close as possible

1615
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,440
but instead of on a specific hardware on

1616
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,839
a general purpose cpu or in a cloud okay

1617
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,200
so you take exactly the same software

1618
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,480
that you have on your network and you

1619
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,960
run it on um

1620
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,799
on a general purpose cpu so this is

1621
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,559
basically you know like a software

1622
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,400
router or a virtual network function and

1623
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,160
so on so next night

1624
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,480
so if you build a network digital tune

1625
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,720
using emulation what will happen is that

1626
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,960
you will have very poor accuracy because

1627
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,920
of course the delay seen by the packets

1628
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,599
which are going through your emulator

1629
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,559
network will be way lower so the delay

1630
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,799
will be sorry higher will be way higher

1631
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,480
than in the real network because your

1632
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,160
emulated network is extremely slow

1633
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,160
because you are not taking advantage of

1634
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,000
the specific hardware

1635
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,240
that that your network is using right

1636
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,599
because basically you are you are

1637
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,280
running your network in a general

1638
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,599
purpose processor instead of in single

1639
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,559
purpose processor which is what you have

1640
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,000
um

1641
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,160
so emulation will will not be accurate

1642
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,680
right the delay that you will measure at

1643
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,599
the emulation will will not be accurate

1644
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,359
with respect to the real infrastructure

1645
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,319
okay

1646
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,319
um this does not mean that the emulation

1647
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,640
has many many relevant use cases and i

1648
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,079
think that it has many relevant use

1649
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,760
cases which also are linked to other

1650
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,280
type of digital twin which are not based

1651
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,599
on performance for instance for training

1652
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,520
or for debugging or for testing new

1653
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,200
features okay i think a demolition has

1654
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,079
many a lot a lot of value but not to

1655
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,960
build a performance network digital twin

1656
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,640
because it offers basically poor

1657
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:07,160
accuracy so next slide please

1658
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,839
so now analytical models queueing theory

1659
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,760
so uh next slide

1660
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,280
now we take a different approach and

1661
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,440
instead of using simulation or emulation

1662
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,760
we try to see what happens if we try to

1663
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,280
build this box

1664
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,599
with analytical models with equations

1665
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,000
and for this we use queuing theory so

1666
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,760
basically queuing theory represents our

1667
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,000
base available analytical tool

1668
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,160
uh for to model networks okay and i'm

1669
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,599
sure that you remember something about

1670
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,359
queuing theory probably from your grad

1671
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,559
studies

1672
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,480
so basically queueing theory it models

1673
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,319
the network as a set of queues as a

1674
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,640
series of skills right and connecting

1675
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,160
this set of queues is what we call

1676
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,160
network and and if you think about that

1677
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,720
it makes sense right um queuing theory

1678
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,839
was um pioneered the application of

1679
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,680
queueing theory was pioneered by leonard

1680
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,039
kleinrock which is considered one of the

1681
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,599
fathers of the internet the

1682
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,559
he laid the the foundational theory

1683
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,880
behind the internet because he was a

1684
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,400
pioneer in application of queueing

1685
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,000
theory to packet switches networks in

1686
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,400
the 70s and that's one of the reason why

1687
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,160
our panel decided to

1688
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,599
to go for packet switches and this is

1689
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,839
what we have today okay so uh next slide

1690
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,760
so what we did was we said okay now

1691
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,039
let's try to build this performance

1692
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,880
network digital twin using giving theory

1693
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,039
so we developed a model using keying

1694
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,319
theory which at the end is a set of

1695
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,839
equations okay

1696
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,680
and this is what we put inside the

1697
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,760
performance network digital twin

1698
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,240
so next slide

1699
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,400
so when you do that what happens is that

1700
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,960
um the digital twin is super fast

1701
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,480
meaning that when you ask a question you

1702
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,400
get an answer super quickly because at

1703
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,839
the end what the only thing that you

1704
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,520
need to run are a set of equations and

1705
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,359
that's computationally very lightweight

1706
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:48,000
and it's very quick

1707
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,440
what happens is that when you try to see

1708
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,480
how accurate is your queueing theory

1709
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,799
when estimating the delay you will find

1710
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:57,599
that

1711
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,400
under realistic traffic models it is not

1712
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,319
accurate at all for instance on the plot

1713
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:05,359
on the right we you have um on the so

1714
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,599
you have three different traffic models

1715
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,400
uh auto related modulated and multiplex

1716
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,200
and on the y y-axis you have the error

1717
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,119
so for modulated traffic which i will

1718
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,119
explain what it is in a second

1719
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,799
um our

1720
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:20,480
queuing severity model

1721
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,200
estimates the delay with a 68

1722
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,599
of error okay so queuing theory does not

1723
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,359
work in this case and it estimates a

1724
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:31,119
delay which is 68 of the real one so it

1725
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,720
was not very accurate

1726
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,960
now modulated in this case modulated

1727
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,039
exponentials can be understood as

1728
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,960
traffic similar to tcp because it has

1729
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,599
some auto operation properties and and

1730
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,599
and it's similar to tcp so for instance

1731
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,359
queueing theory offers very poor

1732
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,160
accuracy when it's when when trying to

1733
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,760
estimate what will happen with traffic

1734
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,760
which looks like tcp okay which behaves

1735
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,200
like tcp

1736
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,920
in this case seventy percent offender

1737
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,680
this is not a limit a limitation that we

1738
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,760
discovered and at all this is very well

1739
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,920
known in the in queueing theory uh

1740
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,200
people working in queueing theory they

1741
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,359
are completely aware that queuing theory

1742
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,680
only works for very synthetic traffic

1743
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,280
but not for realistic traffic so it is

1744
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,280
not an accurate solution for that

1745
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,359
um that's why i believe that it is not

1746
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,680
practical to build a

1747
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,079
network digital twin using qx3 because

1748
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,760
it is not accurate under arresting

1749
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,520
traffic although it is very fast as

1750
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,039
opposed to emulation and simulation it

1751
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,680
is super fast but not very accurate for

1752
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:30,078
for realistic traffic okay so next slide

1753
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,559
so now let's try to use it with neural

1754
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,880
networks let's try to build this kind of

1755
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,559
system with neural networks so how we

1756
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,160
can build this kind of system with a

1757
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,559
neural network okay so neural networks

1758
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,400
all of them they require training okay

1759
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,680
that's the first thing you need when you

1760
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,280
want to build uh something with a neural

1761
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,440
network so let's let's take the example

1762
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,039
of uh in computer vision which is an

1763
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,760
application we are already aware of it

1764
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,760
let's say that we want to build a system

1765
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,760
that identifies pictures of animals and

1766
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,000
it is able to tell us okay this picture

1767
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,920
that's a dog this picture that zakat and

1768
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,839
so on so the first thing you need is a

1769
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,079
training set meaning you need a set of

1770
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,480
pictures with the the right with the

1771
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,400
label meaning that this picture and

1772
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,760
that's the doc i tell you i'm telling

1773
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,200
you that this picture is a dog that's a

1774
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,319
cat so you need the input and the output

1775
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,319
of the model and then this is what the

1776
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,079
neural network uses for training and

1777
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,319
then after training then you can you can

1778
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,160
ask the model a question okay see this

1779
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,839
picture which you have never seen before

1780
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,760
now tell me if it's a dog or a cat or an

1781
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,760
elephant and it will tell you

1782
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,359
so in networking we can do exactly the

1783
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:31,280
same thing right what we can do is

1784
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,440
recall that the input labels of the

1785
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,440
performance network digital twin are

1786
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,520
configuration and load so what we will

1787
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,640
do is

1788
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,640
and i know that that's complex but this

1789
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,160
is the approach we are taking is we take

1790
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,000
one network and we say okay

1791
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,680
if i apply this network configuration

1792
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,079
and i apply this traffic load what the

1793
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,640
performance will get so i get and that's

1794
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,079
the first row of my data set okay so

1795
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,480
input label and output label

1796
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,640
then i take another row i will take a

1797
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,599
different

1798
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,119
network configuration i will change the

1799
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,359
topology where i will change the segment

1800
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,280
routing configuration or the queuing

1801
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,359
policy i will change the traffic and i

1802
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,680
measure what is the performance

1803
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,839
and that's the second row of my data set

1804
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,319
and now i need thousands of rows that's

1805
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,960
complex and costly i need thousands of

1806
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,960
rows and when i have these thousands of

1807
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,079
rows then next slide

1808
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,880
so next slide please

1809
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,359
okay then once i have thousands of rows

1810
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,839
i can train a neural network okay and i

1811
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,160
will tell him i will tell it okay when

1812
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,599
you see this network configuration and

1813
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:34,960
this traffic load that's a performance

1814
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,359
and so on that's training after training

1815
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:38,880
i will be able to watch the neural

1816
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,200
network okay now now after training

1817
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,799
which is very costly but after training

1818
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:44,000
then you have a trained model which is

1819
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,319
very lightweight i will be able to ask

1820
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,240
okay if i have this traffic load which

1821
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,240
you have never seen in the past and you

1822
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,680
have this network configuration which

1823
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,440
you have never seen in the past what

1824
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,200
will be the performance and if i do the

1825
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,440
training correctly and i do many other

1826
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,799
things correctly

1827
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:01,440
the answer should be accurate okay

1828
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,400
so next slide please

1829
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,440
so this is what we did and and for that

1830
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,599
we use a particular type of neural

1831
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,039
network which are called graphical

1832
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,079
network

1833
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,839
which are designed to learn information

1834
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,599
which is structured as a graph okay

1835
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,520
those are called graph network depending

1836
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,279
on your application in ai you need to

1837
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,198
use a particular set of neural network

1838
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,120
architectures okay if your information

1839
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,600
are pictures you use convolutionals

1840
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,359
if your information is like text or

1841
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,439
voice you use recurrent if your

1842
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,279
information is a structure as a graph

1843
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,120
which is a network basically you use

1844
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,600
graph neural networks okay so we did

1845
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,000
precisely that and and we call it

1846
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,238
langnet you have a paper also over there

1847
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:42,000
and we we basically now we are

1848
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,520
implementing the performance network

1849
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,158
digital twin with a train gnn okay so we

1850
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,679
train it and then that's that's the

1851
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,920
performance network digital twin so next

1852
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,479
slide

1853
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,158
okay so um

1854
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:56,479
the first thing we try it is okay

1855
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:00,000
what happens if i ask the performers

1856
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,600
network this is a twin which is built

1857
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,359
using a gnn

1858
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,198
what is the delay for a particular

1859
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:06,880
network configuration and a network

1860
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,799
which has never been seen in training so

1861
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,640
it's a completely different network and

1862
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,359
as we have seen is that if you train um

1863
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,679
this particular model in networks which

1864
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:18,719
are 20 to 30 routers only

1865
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,279
the and you ask after training in

1866
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,920
inference after training you ask okay

1867
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,679
what is the performance of need of this

1868
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,839
network which is 10 times larger and

1869
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:30,000
that you have never seen in in training

1870
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,040
then the the the error um in the worst

1871
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,520
case is 10 okay when estimating the

1872
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,439
delay so it's quite a remarkable

1873
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,799
accuracy

1874
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,600
also the gnn is very fast um it's

1875
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,439
similar to qx every so after training

1876
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,679
training is very expensive but after

1877
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,439
training you can ask a question and the

1878
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:49,600
gnn will will

1879
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,640
give you an answer in 100 milliseconds

1880
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,800
and that's not unique to gnns that's

1881
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,320
pretty much all the neural network and

1882
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,679
here we are using off-the-shelf

1883
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,719
computing but if you use ai accelerators

1884
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,159
you can drop this number to 10

1885
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,280
milliseconds okay so super quick um so

1886
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,120
it's it's the train model it's very

1887
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,560
lightweight and can answer questions

1888
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,280
very um so as we can see very accurately

1889
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,880
and also very quickly and next slide

1890
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,040
and finally what we what we did also was

1891
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,520
to test what happens when you have

1892
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,360
realistic traffic models not not as in

1893
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,280
queueing theory which only works with

1894
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,280
very synthetic traffic models but when

1895
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,520
you have uh traffic models which are you

1896
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,199
know similar to tcp or similar to

1897
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,199
voiceover ap and so on and as you can

1898
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,520
see the the the accuracy is also very

1899
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,920
good in all the in all the across across

1900
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,920
the board and the error when estimating

1901
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,400
the delay is always below 10

1902
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,760
and you have all the details in the

1903
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,719
paper

1904
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,280
now gnns are not freelance right you

1905
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,520
need to build a data set and that's

1906
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,199
quite complex and costly because i was

1907
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:52,800
saying you need to take one network and

1908
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,800
you need to start trying configurations

1909
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,800
trying traffic and seeing what is the

1910
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,159
performance and this is your training

1911
01:10:58,159 --> 01:10:59,040
set

1912
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,199
for the gnn so next slide

1913
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,360
yeah next one

1914
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,880
so that's a table that hopefully

1915
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,560
summarizes what i said during my

1916
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,480
presentation right so emulation will

1917
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,400
give you poor accuracy and it is very

1918
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,000
very slow

1919
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,800
um so it is not practical uh simulation

1920
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,040
the accuracy is very good but the the

1921
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,719
speed at which you will get answers is

1922
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,120
very slow um you know it will take hours

1923
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,040
to simulate one single link in a very

1924
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,600
busy computer queuing theory

1925
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,840
it is it offers poor accuracy in

1926
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,679
realistic traffic conditions but it is

1927
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,080
very fast to get your answers then you

1928
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,159
have another row which i didn't explain

1929
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,239
because of the lack of time but we also

1930
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,840
tested other type of neural networks

1931
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,080
which are not gnns and you have the

1932
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,679
information on the backup slides but

1933
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,679
finally what we have found is that with

1934
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,920
gns you have very good accuracy

1935
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,120
and

1936
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,000
they can give you an answer very fast

1937
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,920
and that's it from my site i don't know

1938
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,520
if you have any questions or comments

1939
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,800
we we have uh luis first then diego

1940
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,000
thank you very much everybody very

1941
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,239
interesting presentation i have a

1942
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,840
three few few questions uh first uh you

1943
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,760
mentioned well you did it in this cnn

1944
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,960
simulation

1945
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,760
uh uh assimilation one

1946
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,560
an analysis with 20 30 routers when you

1947
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,320
comment about increasing the number of

1948
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,000
routers there do you refer to the

1949
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,520
internals of the network so keeping

1950
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,600
let's say the perimeter to

1951
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,000
certain entries and or also to increase

1952
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,480
the number of entry routers or rather

1953
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,320
entry traffic yeah you can multiply

1954
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,719
everything by 10 and it works

1955
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,719
but even also the perimeter oh and the

1956
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,199
sources okay i i uh another short

1957
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,400
question is

1958
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,760
you mentioned that you can train and you

1959
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,480
can change the the

1960
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,080
the different configurations and so but

1961
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,280
i was wondering for instance if you

1962
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,880
introduce new behaviors that could be

1963
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,280
for instance preemption in the queues

1964
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,320
this

1965
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,719
if this has not been trained before

1966
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,480
i suppose that you will not get the

1967
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,520
proper result right so you need to train

1968
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,280
let me elaborate because that's a very

1969
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,040
very good question so

1970
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,280
gnns will be able to provide um

1971
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,800
accurate answers

1972
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,840
to

1973
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,159
different values of the input parameters

1974
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:20,159
so if you have a larger topology if you

1975
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,920
have a different routing configuration

1976
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,400
but a new feature like this is a new

1977
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,920
protocol which

1978
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,760
the gnn has never seen

1979
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,480
during uh training then you need to

1980
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,640
retrain it okay

1981
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,719
as an example as an analogy if if you

1982
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,800
have a computer vision and you train it

1983
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,199
for a set of animals and then yes it

1984
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,280
will identify any picture of that set of

1985
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,280
animals even if the particular picture

1986
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,120
was not on the training side but if

1987
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,400
there is a new animal you need to

1988
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,400
retrain it okay and the very last

1989
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,000
question is um

1990
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
with this

1991
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,440
with these techniques also we could have

1992
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,199
a view of jitter on

1993
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,239
so not only delay or throughput but also

1994
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,000
yeah actually i didn't say it but it's

1995
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,800
uh it's loss it's per flow loss delay

1996
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,199
jitter link utilization and q

1997
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:09,280
utilization okay thank you very much

1998
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,040
next is diego please

1999
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,040
no it was simply

2000
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,520
looking at here at these um and thinking

2001
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,880
that we live in a world of

2002
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,760
composition and

2003
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,880
containers and lambdas and all the like

2004
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,120
don't you think that probably in many in

2005
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,320
most cases or in most practical cases

2006
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,560
a digital stream will be a combination

2007
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,880
of several i mean if you are not very

2008
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,120
much concerned about accuracy but you

2009
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,679
want to have a an approximate value

2010
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:45,120
probably using uh um i don't know uh

2011
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,199
theory but for a certain part for the

2012
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,920
core but you are going to go to

2013
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,840
very much detail in a certain part or

2014
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,400
you want emulation would you go to yeah

2015
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,719
yes i

2016
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,000
but delay has this nice property which

2017
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,760
is additive right if you

2018
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,199
take the end-to-end delay and you want

2019
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,719
to speed it in parts and you can

2020
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,320
estimate for each part where it would be

2021
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,159
delayed then you can add it up and you

2022
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,400
will get a nice estimation yeah

2023
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,800
but jitter no unless no digital losses

2024
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,159
they you cannot

2025
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,159
divide them into parts and compute them

2026
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,320
independently it's more complex yes both

2027
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,080
will depend on the yeah

2028
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,920
but but this is the kind of discussion i

2029
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,199
think it has value right because when

2030
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,040
you start thinking about okay what is my

2031
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,480
output what i want to do i want to

2032
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,719
predict the delay then the discussion is

2033
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,560
more easier to have because we are down

2034
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,600
to the graph

2035
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,239
and

2036
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,159
and that's fine if if those inputs and

2037
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,080
outputs are not the right ones i don't i

2038
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,520
don't think that maybe they are not the

2039
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,199
right ones but when we have the inputs

2040
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,480
and outputs then discussion is way

2041
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,799
easier

2042
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,640
so i'm born with less so uh thank you

2043
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,000
very much for this presentation i've

2044
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
been waiting for it for quite some time

2045
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,800
because there is quite a mix of you know

2046
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,120
emulation versus simulation versus

2047
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,239
analytics etc so i like it very much so

2048
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,560
okay the conclusion is that your graph

2049
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,040
neural network is fast

2050
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,800
great

2051
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,000
accurate

2052
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,520
well

2053
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,239
maybe because in the end we deal with

2054
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,440
routers

2055
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,840
that have hardware limitations

2056
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,480
that have sometime bugs that have their

2057
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,600
own

2058
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,199
limitation depending on how they're

2059
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,320
connected

2060
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,120
so uh my message is i'm wondering if

2061
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,040
we're not trying to solve everything

2062
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,800
with digital twin

2063
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,120
in a sense that okay digital twin is

2064
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,520
like a copy of your network

2065
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,600
now we speak about performance network

2066
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,159
digital twin and i'm wondering how far

2067
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:39,920
we could go because

2068
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,679
you know you mentioned the four metric

2069
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:44,000
that you've got network utilization well

2070
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
if you put more flows in there sure it's

2071
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,600
easy to deduce

2072
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,000
then there is like a

2073
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,120
delay

2074
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,600
delay we could as you mentioned it's

2075
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,679
additive that's a great property so we

2076
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,560
could get it with a high level accuracy

2077
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,400
if we go into packet loss well

2078
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,560
it's not to be very hardware independent

2079
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,159
artwork dependence

2080
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:08,480
right if we go with jitter as you

2081
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,159
mentioned that's the most complex one

2082
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,719
because well we cannot add it so i

2083
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,560
actually have to test it

2084
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,480
so i slowly arrive at the conclusion

2085
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,480
that maybe digital twin is not the tool

2086
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,480
for everything because if we want to

2087
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,880
test performance which is the thing that

2088
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,239
we care about delay packet loss jitter

2089
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,719
and link utilization that's easy

2090
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:31,040
i start to believe that we'll have to do

2091
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,360
it in the real network

2092
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,920
so i agree with you that uh liquidation

2093
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,840
is easy but i cannot agree with your

2094
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,600
other statements i'm sorry

2095
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,320
so

2096
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,400
if that's the beauty of neural network

2097
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,040
it's a data-driven approach so if your

2098
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,719
real net

2099
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:49,040
hardware device has bugs that's fine

2100
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,640
they will show up on the data set and

2101
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,280
the gnn will will catch up those backs

2102
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,800
because you are training with real data

2103
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,120
from the real network

2104
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,560
it doesn't matter how complex the

2105
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,120
hardware is uh gnn will be able to to

2106
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,880
model that

2107
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,760
very good so i like that answer now the

2108
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,120
fact is that you need to update the

2109
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,080
setup out of the router yes and i agree

2110
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,920
and you mentioned it's expensive yeah

2111
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,560
that's expensive yeah and so uh in your

2112
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,880
in your uh diagram you are showing that

2113
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,400
you wanted to have all packets all

2114
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,880
packet headers basically right

2115
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,280
you need to well you need to as if you

2116
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,800
want to you build this one you need like

2117
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,480
configuration a description of the

2118
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,679
traffic load and then you need to

2119
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,520
measure the flow delay jitter and losses

2120
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,719
yeah

2121
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:31,920
right so

2122
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,760
this is what will be

2123
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,080
as you as you call expensive

2124
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,239
because it's a prerequisite to enter

2125
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,239
into this line line with last line which

2126
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,239
is fast i agree and you convince me it

2127
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,880
could be good yeah yeah so

2128
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,960
so can i can i say something because i

2129
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,480
think that you you put a very good

2130
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,960
question that's why we make such a big

2131
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,560
effort into

2132
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,280
building models that are able to be

2133
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,840
trained on small networks and and

2134
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,760
operate in very large networks because

2135
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,440
what we believe is the commercial

2136
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,719
solution to the problem that you're

2137
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:05,440
putting is okay let's say i'm a vendor i

2138
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,600
i cannot go to at this network and ask

2139
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,560
them okay i need a data set please

2140
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,400
i need a link failure because i need to

2141
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,080
see a link failure in my data set for

2142
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,760
the gnn to understand what happens when

2143
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,760
there is a link failure so please throw

2144
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,120
away that link

2145
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,800
please congest the network because i

2146
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,880
need a data set with a congested network

2147
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,480
because the gnn needs to see what

2148
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,400
happens when driver is congested okay of

2149
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,239
course this is crazy right

2150
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:30,480
so what we think it makes sense but i'm

2151
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,320
hoping for discussion is

2152
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,199
let's

2153
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:35,920
build a data set uh sorry i'm a vendor i

2154
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,000
built a small test bed

2155
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,679
you know and i

2156
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:41,760
generate a training set there

2157
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,080
like super complex training set i can in

2158
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,480
my test bed at the vendor lab i can

2159
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,320
throw links i can congest the network

2160
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,400
and then if the general is properly

2161
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,080
trained and it has this nicest gravity

2162
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,560
property which gnns have i can use the

2163
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,920
train model

2164
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,840
to operate in networks which are larger

2165
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,679
than the test bed

2166
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:01,520
so and then you have like in the

2167
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,080
self-driving car model right when when

2168
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,320
we expect to buy a self-driving car

2169
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,639
they give they give you the the car has

2170
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:10,639
been already trained where has been

2171
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,800
trained well in you know towns which are

2172
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,120
i don't know in nevada

2173
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,760
and they are facilities at the at the

2174
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,199
see my point

2175
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:22,159
that's what we envision

2176
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,800
that that's what works for

2177
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,280
single domain single vendor

2178
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,600
uh type of environment i'm wondering

2179
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,639
you know

2180
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,639
i like your conclusions

2181
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,000
what i would need i know it's a

2182
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
difficult question but

2183
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,960
uh getting all data sets it's like the

2184
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,719
starting point for uni data scientists

2185
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,320
and it's difficult yeah what would be

2186
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,440
good is

2187
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,239
what kind of accuracy if you get like

2188
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:47,280
flows

2189
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,400
and flows with sample data and if you

2190
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,400
get a little bit of delay but not

2191
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,120
everything and trying to see how far we

2192
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,920
could you know get into the good and

2193
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,480
fast but with some data

2194
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,320
yeah and this is where i'm trying to to

2195
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,880
match the two because right now with the

2196
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,159
small amount of data we could get from

2197
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,239
networks today that's a fact except

2198
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:11,120
flows right yeah then uh

2199
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,120
we're stuck to let me try it in the real

2200
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,440
world yeah i agree because so far

2201
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,679
because we are in a lab we can

2202
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,840
assume well we generate as much data as

2203
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,080
we want and we don't care and we pay the

2204
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,000
cost because it's an academic exercise

2205
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,600
but in reality i think it's very

2206
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,280
important to see

2207
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,960
actually how much did i i do need from

2208
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,560
the test bed and how accurate will be

2209
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,880
depending on the data and and

2210
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,719
because you are making also a very valid

2211
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,280
point there is a there is a new trend in

2212
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,600
ai which is called which is coined by

2213
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,000
the stamper professor andrew ng which is

2214
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,080
called data centric ai and what what he

2215
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,920
says is look it's not about the

2216
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,120
algorithms anymore we have the

2217
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,440
algorithms it's about the data okay but

2218
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,960
it's not about yeah i have billions of

2219
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,920
data if which is the minimum set of data

2220
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,159
you need to train a model and that is

2221
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,239
called the data center ki and actually

2222
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,400
um we have a challenge

2223
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,440
um

2224
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,840
on the i will i will send send it to the

2225
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,360
mailing list we have a challenge on

2226
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,280
precisely what you said it's data

2227
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,400
centric ai for network digital twin so

2228
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,400
which is the minimum set of data you

2229
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,159
need to generate from a network in order

2230
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:16,639
to have this fantastic accuracy

2231
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,719
and that's a question we don't know yet

2232
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,400
okay

2233
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,600
so we

2234
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,360
were leading a bit over schedule um we

2235
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,520
have two two question panning we have a

2236
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,880
comment uh in the chat from uh zaid

2237
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,360
uh so i will bring it to to the audio

2238
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,280
here so training a neural network to

2239
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,520
recognize the cat is dealing with

2240
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,719
data sets

2241
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,199
network traffic pattern is not finite

2242
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:44,879
how will this solution deal with that

2243
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,440
i didn't can you repeat the question

2244
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,480
please

2245
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,639
yeah so if you want to trade on your

2246
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:51,679
network

2247
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,760
for instance to recognize animals it's

2248
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,600
an infinite data set

2249
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,760
yeah okay

2250
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,679
so they mentioned that network traffic

2251
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,920
patterns are not finished

2252
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,560
how will this solution deal with that

2253
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,800
so they are not finished but they can be

2254
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,520
characterized by uh features

2255
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,679
and the features they they have values

2256
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:13,199
from zero to one let's say and i agree

2257
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:14,560
they are infinite numbers between zero

2258
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,719
to one but neural networks what they do

2259
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,639
is if you show them the feature at value

2260
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:19,440
zero

2261
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,480
20 0.5 0 75 and 1

2262
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,080
it will interpolate what happens in the

2263
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,960
middle so the the key answer to this

2264
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,600
question which is again it's true in

2265
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,280
machine learning is that you need to

2266
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,679
represent your data with features and

2267
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,600
you need to show in the training set

2268
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,040
different values for that for those

2269
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,040
features

2270
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,600
yeah i think it also uh relates to the

2271
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,520
question from lewis that if you have new

2272
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,520
mechanism or protocols you will need to

2273
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,000
retrain

2274
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,159
if there is a new traffic traffic model

2275
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,159
which you cannot describe with the

2276
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,320
features you have created then you need

2277
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,480
to retrain it yeah i agree

2278
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,120
okay uh so i i have one question and i

2279
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,960
think we have chain in the queue we need

2280
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,800
to to speed up a bit

2281
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,159
um

2282
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,679
i have many questions but i will just

2283
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:10,719
use one

2284
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,639
um you mentioned that you you found that

2285
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,639
you were training uh over a limited set

2286
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,239
of notes and you are trying to say okay

2287
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:18,639
how it applies to the to uh

2288
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:20,480
to network that are bigger

2289
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,120
my question is that um have you tried to

2290
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,280
assess the sensitivity of

2291
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,040
the neural network

2292
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,120
if there are changes in the in the

2293
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,880
properties of the topology you see for

2294
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,239
instance if you have a change in

2295
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,639
connectivity degree or you go to mesh to

2296
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,880
rings or different types of uh the

2297
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,679
topology uh changes do you have you seen

2298
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:41,840
sensitivity to that yeah very good

2299
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,239
question also so uh this is not our work

2300
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:47,199
again this is a standard gnns they what

2301
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:47,920
the

2302
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,520
the mask what they tell you is that gen

2303
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,600
end will be able to

2304
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,920
provide good accuracy as long as the

2305
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,440
distribution of the graph that they have

2306
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,120
seen in training is similar to the

2307
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,880
distribution of the graph that they have

2308
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,360
they seen during inference in operation

2309
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,120
which means that if you want to have

2310
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,280
good accuracy in ring topologies you

2311
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,880
need to include ring topologies into

2312
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,040
your data set into your training set if

2313
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,960
you want if you want to have good

2314
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,400
accuracy with a scale

2315
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,159
graph topologies you need to have those

2316
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:16,880
in training so everything goes down to

2317
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,480
what you put in training it's the most

2318
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,080
important question actually yeah so i

2319
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,600
agree you need to

2320
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,199
have you need to show this kind of

2321
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:25,600
topologies yes

2322
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,159
okay thanks a lot albert we have chang

2323
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:31,040
in the in the queue

2324
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,440
do you have a question for albert or are

2325
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,560
you in the queue for the next

2326
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,239
presentation

2327
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,800
oh yes uh so before i start my

2328
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,040
presentation can i uh ask one more

2329
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,320
question

2330
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,080
yes please

2331
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,360
okay uh

2332
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,400
this question is also about data set so

2333
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,679
can i know

2334
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:55,040
the the skill or how large the data set

2335
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,600
is in your geo and test

2336
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,480
and uh what's the cost to build that set

2337
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,560
to label the data set

2338
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,159
yeah so the data set just to give you an

2339
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:09,199
idea it has 100 000 rows and each row is

2340
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,120
one network configuration one traffic

2341
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,440
load and the performance and each row

2342
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,360
it's it's a huge matrix because it's a

2343
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,360
configuration for all the nodes the all

2344
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,639
the flows

2345
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,840
and we have 100 000

2346
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,800
rows so it's very large um

2347
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,600
and

2348
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,360
and that's why we have this challenge

2349
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,280
that we organize along with i2t which is

2350
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,120
okay which is the minimum data set that

2351
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,600
you can produce to have a fantastic

2352
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,080
accuracy

2353
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,440
okay since your uh your uh model

2354
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,960
includes the parameter of the

2355
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,920
configuration so whenever

2356
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,239
a specific parameter is changed you need

2357
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:49,520
to rechain the model is that correct

2358
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,840
yes no you don't need you need to so you

2359
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,280
don't need to retrain it if you change

2360
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,880
the routing configuration that's fine

2361
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,080
you will get good performance

2362
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,920
okay thank you

2363
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:04,440
okay thank you thank you so much

2364
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:07,360
okay so jen you can uh

2365
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,799
start your presentation please

2366
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,360
if you can try to be quick

2367
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,600
you'll be appreciated thank you okay i

2368
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,960
would try to be as great as possible hi

2369
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,040
shares and everyone this is chen

2370
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,960
from china mobile today i will present

2371
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,480
the draft update of

2372
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,480
digital network concept and the

2373
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,159
reference architecture on behalf of our

2374

courses next next live please

2375
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,199
okay our scope of the draft includes to

2376
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:37,360
present an overview of the concept of

2377
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,679
digital team network and to provide the

2378
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,440
basic definitions and the schedule

2379
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,520
reference architecture and to either

2380
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,840
identify use cases and the discussion

2381
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,840
benefits and key challenges

2382
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,320
of the technology the objectives of the

2383

2392
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,679
next slide please

2393
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,960
okay after several objects and the

2394
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,400
dictators in group

2395
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,760
the draft

2396
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,880
code for adoption in december 2022 and

2397
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,159
the chapter

2398
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:23,360
was adopted by rgb circle and in the

2399
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,080
review cycle we received more than 50

2400

and thank you very much and we just

2409
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,920
uploaded the arch version that's their

2410
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,159
disco and the most comments were just in

2411
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:56,679
this version let's please

2412
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,600
okay this table shows a summary on the

2413
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,440
comments we received and the actions

2414
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,880
we've taken

2415
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,400
we have taken

2416
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,800
we have addressed most comments

2417
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,719
while either explaining in the mailing

2418
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:12,159
list or revising the new version time

2419
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:13,920
limited so i will not describe them in

2420
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,760
detail next slide please

2421
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:20,159
okay this slide shows the major changes

2422
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,920
we made in the

2423
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,760
in the new version and include better

2424
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,840
better structure the content strengthen

2425
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,400
the research background and more focus

2426
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,920
on the challenges and

2427
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,560
close some old issues and focus on

2428
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,000
some new future research productions

2429
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,560
next please

2430
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,360
okay for the radiation all the issues uh

2431
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,320
we uh this table shows the five

2432
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,120
and five of them and one is the

2433
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,040
new section of the new technology be

2434
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,480
added a second is a recommendation on to

2435
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,159
describe recent rtf rtf technology the

2436
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,440
third is to

2437
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,239
go deep into one or two use case and the

2438
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:06,639
first is to study i mentioned earlier

2439
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,880
technique is related to the digital

2440
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,920
network and the five is uh the fifth is

2441
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,080
uh uh which level of detail should the

2442
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,920
document should include with without

2443
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,920
losing its purpose especially for

2444
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,239
challenging and enabling technology

2445
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:23,679
sections and of all the issues we have

2446
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,800
opened in the mailing list for comments

2447
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,280
let's please

2448
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:33,120
okay

2449
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,760
from this slides on uh i will take time

2450
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,440
to uh to to discuss some open uh item

2451
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,560
items uh regarding the detail network

2452
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,080
they are motivation challenges

2453
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,639
architecture enabling technology and the

2454
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,199
research directions respectively next

2455
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,440
please

2456
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,840
firstly what's the motivations and the

2457
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,880
requirements of for dt network

2458
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,239
we summarized

2459
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,800
the four challenges in network

2460
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,280
operation and maintenance

2461
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,960
firstly a new

2462
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,840
new uh new net network services emerging

2463
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,360
endlessly and

2464
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:16,000
the network scale continues to expand

2465
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,360
sadly the complexity of network om is

2466
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,440
becoming higher thirdly in inertial

2467
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,920
technology in longer time to deploy

2468
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,239
and firstly network optimizing

2469
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:28,400
optimization has a high cost and high

2470
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,239
risk due to vulnerable production

2471
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:31,520
environment

2472
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,080
and to address these challenges uh we

2473
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,480
can see uh no

2474
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,199
new

2475
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:39,120
network of automation and autonomous

2476
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,440
operations are becoming a new region and

2477
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,560
recently uh ibm intend-based vlan uh

2478
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,760
intern based networking uh ultra driving

2479
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,800
network network adm zero touchdown has

2480
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,600
been studied and we can also see

2481
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,040
ai machine learning technology that are

2482
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,800
widely used in

2483
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,400
network field to help achieve this

2484
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,560
region

2485
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,480
and uh

2486
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,679
teach uh now we will digit here

2487
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:08,000
we can see that it brings a new chance

2488
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,639
to meet these challenges uh virtual real

2489
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:13,040
mapping and interaction

2490
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,719
interaction brings a solution beyond the

2491
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:16,960
physical network and network direction

2492
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,760
can help physical networks to realize

2493
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,000
a low cost trial intelligence decision

2494
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,760
making efficient innovation and

2495
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,840
predictive

2496
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,400
let's please

2497
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,080
then what are challenges to build dtt uh

2498
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,360
network

2499
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,679
first according to a sighted paper here

2500
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:39,679
uh the main challenge is to build and

2501
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,280
maintain uh

2502
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,840
digital twins in industrial field uh can

2503
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,000
be summarized as five aspects uh they

2504
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,679
are uh data acquisition and processing

2505
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:52,880
high fidelity modeling real-time

2506
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,639
two-way connection between the russia

2507
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,719
and the real trees unified the

2508
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:58,960
development platform and towards

2509
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,520
environmental coupling technologies

2510
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,440
and the net network field has its own

2511
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,760
characteristic characteristics such as a

2512
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:09,360
higher level of digitalization uh nation

2513
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:13,040
multiple services and complex system so

2514
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,760
uh we we think that i will summarize uh

2515
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,040
here are five

2516
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,360
challenges to build a dt network

2517
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,239
there are large skills challenges

2518
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:24,480
interoperability data modeling

2519
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,400
difficulties real-time

2520
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,880
requirements and characteristics of

2521
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,360
course i will here we have to work on

2522
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,080
any other input on challenges if any

2523
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,400
next piece

2524
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,239
oh let's uh

2525
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,719
go quick uh quickly uh go through the

2526
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,800
reference architecture we recommended in

2527
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,800
the dropped uh in the three layer

2528
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,040
architecture the top layer

2529
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,120
uh lowest layer is physical network

2530
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,639
there is network application the

2531
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:55,040
intermediate layer is a natural digital

2532
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,639
twin which is called part of the system

2533
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:59,600
system and an optional sub layer was

2534
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,760
added can be added

2535
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,840
for data collection and change control

2536
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,600
functionalities

2537
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,239
yes please

2538
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,840
based on the

2539
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,000
reference architecture we plug in the

2540
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,600
above we recommend the file in enabling

2541
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,880
technology to build the digital system

2542
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,880
first is data collection

2543
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,000
including

2544
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,199
uh diverse exist existing tools

2545
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:33,280
for example smg network telemetry

2546
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:39,199
narration a innovative new tools for

2547
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:41,520
example sketch based measurement

2548
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,639
and

2549
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,119
semantic aggregation mechanism for data

2550
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,600
integration and the action translation

2551
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:51,679
uh the the second technology is for data

2552
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:53,840
storage and the services as an editor of

2553
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,080
iit technologies and the third is

2554
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,000
network modeling which is

2555
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,880
the the most important one and uh for

2556
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,679
small skill network uh we think that net

2557
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:06,320
network simulators uh for example

2558
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,159
uh s2 uh

2559
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:11,520
g and s3 or virtualized source can be up

2560
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,719
it can be an

2561
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,960
option and for a large-scale network

2562
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,040
local solutions normally based on formal

2563
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,520
methods of mathematical measures

2564
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,719
including uh what what judy has just uh

2565
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:25,840
described the uh for gin queues

2566
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:29,600
currencies neural network yeah and we

2567
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,080
think that a uh machine learning

2568
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,239
ai can be used to build complex function

2569
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:36,320
models into an entity

2570
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,679
and the the first is a visualization it

2571
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:41,600
is to display the

2572
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,159
net network topology

2573
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:45,840
operational status

2574
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,480
and also to uh

2575
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,679
to uh

2576
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:52,560
inter inter interactive visualizing uh

2577
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,760
to show better uh understanding and help

2578
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,840
reduce and explore the network the

2579
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:01,119
interfaces and protocols for users

2580
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:04,239
finally is the interfaces to ensure the

2581
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,119
proper interoperability or capability of

2582
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:08,480
the system

2583
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,718
as please

2584
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,760
oh this slide shows a test study on the

2585
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,119
data collection

2586
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:21,119
there is an efficient efficient data

2587
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:24,480
flashing method for digital network

2588
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,360
and we know current collection method

2589
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,280
i just collect raw and four data from

2590
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,679
physical network and have problems of

2591
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,159
time cost insufficient storage resource

2592
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:36,320
low computational efficiency and waste

2593
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,520
of bandwidth

2594
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,920
and this this struct or this method

2595
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,320
proposes an efficient and lightweight

2596
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,639
data collection aggregation and

2597
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:46,239
correlation method

2598
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:49,280
uh for more details we can see the the

2599
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,280
draft we uploaded in the emergency

2600
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,360
data chapter

2601
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,920
next please

2602
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,600
uh this lecture is another uh case study

2603
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,280
on network modeling

2604
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,560
it is a

2605
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,880
knowledge graph based construct method

2606
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,600
for digital team network

2607
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,560
in this solution

2608
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,080
network system

2609
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,480
design referred to refer to the

2610
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,440
architecture in this structure and

2611
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,040
the base mode in

2612
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,280
in the in the solution are built via

2613
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,840
formal methods uh network device models

2614
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,600
are built based on the six circle

2615
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,400
ontology and topology models are built

2616
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,480
using a knowledge graph

2617
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,960
and a function based on that function

2618
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,199
models can be built using ai and

2619
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:39,040
machining algorithms

2620
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,719
for more details

2621
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:44,400
you can find it in our short paper

2622
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,638
next please

2623
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,760
okay here uh we we want to propose some

2624
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,000
future candidates research directories

2625
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,920
uh some of them are not limited to these

2626
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,560
jobs uh first

2627
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,880
we think that we need to go deeper

2628
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:04,320
to to for the five key

2629
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,360
technologies listed above

2630
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,239
next is that we should get more

2631
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:13,119
measurements to quantify the gain

2632
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:16,719
brought by dtn to network management and

2633
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:17,760
next

2634
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,880
are how ai machine learning rdl

2635
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,600
algorithm used for network modeling and

2636
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,159
how can knowledge be injected to network

2637
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:27,840
digital training to help pursue vision

2638
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:31,280
of autonomous network and how can

2639
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,800
the digital chain

2640
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,520
network integrate and evolve with legacy

2641
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,840
network management management system

2642
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,920
and finally finally

2643
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,440
we need to define

2644
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,679
capability levels and evaluation methods

2645
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:44,480
for

2646
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,440
dt

2647
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,000
network voices the resource requirement

2648
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
and the effectiveness evaluation of a

2649
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,199
dtt system and the metrics and the

2650
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:54,880
measurements to evaluate the accuracy

2651
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,840
and fidelity of our

2652
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,719
geodet yes please

2653
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,560
going forward uh we are to issue stress

2654
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,159
for each of the candidates research

2655
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:07,119
directions

2656
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:10,400
and to record out then to

2657
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,600
record the outcome of this class

2658
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,360
as appropriate

2659
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,679
and we also overcome proposed proposals

2660
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,320
to enhance the document

2661
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,800
and your comments are always welcome

2662
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,520
that's all thank you

2663
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,119
thank you shane for being efficient in

2664
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:31,920
the presentation um we

2665
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,159
have maybe the opportunity to have

2666
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:36,639
information on the updates and the

2667
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:39,199
directions set by uh the offer of this

2668
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:42,879
draft activity

2669
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,760
so if not

2670
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,480
uh thanks jane let's let's use a bit of

2671
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,760
time now to

2672
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,159
continue uh on this topic of network

2673
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:56,000
digital tweet i think we had two good

2674
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,320
presentation in already in the in the

2675
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,239
discussion with albert and the question

2676
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:01,840
uh we i think we

2677
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,199
started to touch

2678
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:06,480
on a few good points uh so what we

2679
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,960
wanted to also is um

2680
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,119
again in this notion of a research

2681
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:14,480
activity exploring a new new aspect

2682
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,239
uh let me share

2683
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:18,080
quickly something

2684
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,679
so we we had a

2685
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,560
set of questions

2686
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,639
okay i hope you can see it let me know

2687
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:27,679
if it's big enough

2688
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,159
so this was shared on the mailing list

2689
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:35,440
and also here on the hdoc

2690
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,840
the idea was to

2691
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,840
really for the research group

2692
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,159
and in general it can be beyond energy

2693
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:42,960
but

2694
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,960
to try to

2695
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,840
to to think more what what it means

2696
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,760
network digital twin what are the

2697
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:52,159
research directions uh research

2698
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,920
challenges that

2699
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,119
appears

2700
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:57,760
and so uh jerome and myself we we

2701
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,760
drafted the first set of questions of

2702
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,119
course this is

2703
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:03,040
open to anyone in the group to add

2704
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:04,800
questions and of course to provide your

2705
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,560
views and opinions

2706
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,239
on the already existing questions

2707
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:11,520
so

2708
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:12,480
jerome

2709
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,159
i would like to proceed do we go through

2710
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:16,320
the questions do we open the floor for

2711
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,159
for inputs if there are already people

2712
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:22,000
willing to comment on any of those

2713
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,280
i think

2714
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,639
let's open the

2715
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:28,639
people if they want to give something

2716
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:30,400
back i think

2717
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,320
we're gonna try to go each question by

2718
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,880
questions i think it's um

2719
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,800
you can go as as people want so there's

2720
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,560
a question if they want to comment some

2721
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,280
of them and so

2722
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:44,840
okay

2723
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:47,840
so if you have

2724
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,560
any inputs on that please

2725
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:54,360
put yourself in the queue

2726
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,840
yes jerome please

2727
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,040
like i can start maybe um so i think we

2728
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,040
have we had a lot of

2729
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,199
already some some discussion before with

2730
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:16,639
albert talk on uh on this point but

2731
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:17,760
um

2732
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,719
regarding although yeah the accuracy of

2733
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:22,000
the model that you want to use for

2734
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,320
digital twin and the data that you have

2735
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,480
as input

2736
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,880
and but my question is

2737
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:29,920
that

2738
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,239
okay i want to evaluate i want a digital

2739
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,000
twin to evaluate for example preference

2740
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,400
metric or write over matrix

2741
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,960
but the um the interpretation of this

2742
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,440
metric and the let's say usefulness of

2743
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,560
this metric may really depend on on the

2744
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,560
on the um

2745
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,800
and let's say uh maybe scenario of

2746
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,800
application for example if you have

2747
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,560
preference metering that is about the

2748
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,560
latency maybe you you don't want it

2749
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,119
knowing exactly what would be the

2750
01:42:57,119 --> 01:42:58,320
um

2751
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,239
the latency from purely metric point of

2752
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:01,920
view but more on the application that

2753
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,840
you may have at the end the latency will

2754
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,159
be used maybe to uh

2755
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:07,360
to

2756
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:10,639
add resources or whatever and so on

2757
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:12,880
and my question is

2758
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,960
is a digital twin

2759
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,560
because we have to retrace digital tree

2760
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,920
for each when you have new let's say

2761
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,320
maybe type of

2762
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,280
data feature as albert say using gen and

2763
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,520
i mean here but if you want to use for

2764
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,520
like this kind of approach

2765
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,239
uh we can sure we can ensure that we

2766
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,400
have enough cases

2767
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,560
to really have a representative model

2768
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,760
for digital twin um because okay you can

2769
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,760
evaluate accuracy but this may be very

2770
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,679
focused on the kind of

2771
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:43,679
metric or accuracy or use keys but if

2772
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:45,199
you want to promote the gita twin to be

2773
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:46,400
used for

2774
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,520
more

2775
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,639
uh

2776
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,159
from to

2777
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:52,080
actually to ask more questions even for

2778
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,159
the same kind of performance or security

2779
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:56,639
or whatever same kind of question but

2780
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,440
will it depend on where it will be used

2781
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:02,400
um does it mean that

2782
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,159
we can ensure that the model we use

2783
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:06,880
whatever the modal activities

2784
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,000
that we use is will be uh

2785
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,760
will be enough accurate

2786
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,679
um i don't think

2787
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:16,320
we are representing different models

2788
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,880
with different let's say

2789
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,360
advantages and drawbacks

2790
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,880
um

2791
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,719
and with that the case that uh

2792
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,360
the models that we need somehow in my

2793
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,360
opinion it's not that we should need one

2794
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,840
single models maybe we need to some

2795
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,560
couple different models as well

2796
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,400
and

2797
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,880
this is my is that not

2798
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,639
there is not single let's say model that

2799
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:45,040
will fit holes that for sure um

2800
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,560
even if in a

2801
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,480
simple use case i think we we have to

2802
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:52,719
think that models could be combined uh

2803
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:53,600
and

2804
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,080
yeah that's that's really my point and

2805
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,920
yeah we we

2806
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,520
also assume that we can have data i

2807
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,719
think some things that have been said we

2808
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:03,040
can have data and uh i think which is

2809
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,320
very interesting here also in the

2810
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,320
presentation regarding the architecture

2811
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,679
is that even if you know that we have

2812
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:09,920
data that could be used is all we can

2813
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,440
ensure that we collect the right data at

2814
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,920
the right time to basically

2815
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,520
um

2816
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,480
uh

2817
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,800
evaluate the output of any digital twin

2818
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,320
i think this is really important as well

2819
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,199
and that's all for my first comment

2820
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:30,480
actually

2821
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,239
okay thank you

2822
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:34,080
let's try to have it as a let's say as a

2823
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,320
group discussion i see that um albert is

2824
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,360
also

2825
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,080
waiting on the mic

2826
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,199
you can speak if you want

2827
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:45,840
yeah okay thanks this is albert cabellos

2828
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:46,719
so

2829
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:47,840
i i

2830
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,600
i feel that we have

2831
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,600
sort of a chicken and a problem uh

2832
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,679
chicken and egg problem meaning that

2833
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,040
somehow we try to be very general um and

2834
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,520
we we try not to be

2835
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,000
narrowed down by a particular use case

2836
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,840
or or by a particular model and i

2837
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,280
understand why

2838
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,800
because this is a research group and

2839
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,520
that's the goal of the research group

2840
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,320
but what happens when we try to be so

2841
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,000
general is that

2842
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,840
we get lost into the forest right

2843
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,880
because the discussion is very hard

2844
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,800
all the answers are at the end it

2845
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,080
depends

2846
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,639
uh and so on now

2847
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:25,360
when

2848
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,880
when we discuss

2849
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,679
a specific network digital twin and and

2850
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:31,679
again i'm not saying that the one

2851
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:33,600
i put in the slides is the right one i

2852
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,440
don't i don't i don't know enough about

2853
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,360
networks i have never run a network and

2854
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,800
i have never built a network so i don't

2855
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,679
know

2856
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:42,800
but what i know is that when we say okay

2857
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,800
that's the input and that's the output

2858
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,719
then all these questions that i believe

2859
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:48,960
are relevant can be answered in a very

2860
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,880
specific way and very concrete way right

2861
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,159
and then

2862
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:53,600
suddenly

2863
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,320
very specific problems show up like okay

2864
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,159
yes you can build a performance network

2865
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:01,280
digital twin yes can a vendor do it yes

2866
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,360
but then it will be single vendor right

2867
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,840
because the vendor will not train using

2868
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,239
uh equipment from other vendors and

2869
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:09,920
that's a real issue

2870
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,159
um

2871
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:14,159
and and i'm into that chicken neck

2872
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:15,600
problem right so

2873
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,080
when i try to discuss it at a very

2874
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:21,119
in a very abstract way i'm lost when i

2875
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:23,040
make it too specific then i understand

2876
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,360
that i'm being too specific

2877
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,199
maybe a solution to this is discussing

2878
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:28,639
okay what are the inputs and the outputs

2879
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:30,320
let's start by this if we agree that

2880
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,600
that's a box there are inputs and

2881
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,440
outputs let's let's try to discuss which

2882
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,960
are the relevant ones

2883
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:37,600
and which use cases enable different

2884
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,199
inputs and outputs and what are the

2885
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:40,560
challenges when you start considering

2886
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,840
different inputs and outputs and i'm

2887
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:43,600
pretty certain that there are a

2888
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,600
particular set of inputs and output for

2889
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,040
which maybe emulation is better than

2890
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,040
neural networks or maybe a simulator or

2891
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,520
maybe a queueing theory i don't know but

2892
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:54,400
it's very hard to discuss this without a

2893
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,600
specific

2894
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,320
goal in mind

2895
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,800
and that was it

2896
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,239
thank you albert

2897
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:11,520
all the views for for participants we

2898
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,600
have maybe a couple more minutes to try

2899
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,960
to get feedback on those questions

2900
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:24,879
olga please

2901
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:28,560
i do believe one of the cool things for

2902
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:32,000
digital twin would be to encompass the

2903
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,239
the business intent as well

2904
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:36,560
you know on top of the you know

2905
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,719
information about the configuration and

2906
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:40,080
traffic

2907
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,639
uh i do believe it is important that we

2908
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:43,760
understand

2909
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,840
all the

2910
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,080
business including different

2911
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,320
intents for different customers

2912
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,639
some security policies in the

2913
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:54,239
organization

2914
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:56,320
any kind of other very high level

2915
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,920
policies that are not really

2916
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:59,360
configuration

2917
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,840
things so i think that is one of the

2918
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,159
most important thing how to

2919
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:05,760
connect the

2920
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:09,360
business intents with the digital twin

2921
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,679
in order to be able to kind of

2922
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:12,880
do self

2923
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,280
optimization self-correction in the

2924
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,840
right way

2925
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,159
thank you olga

2926
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:26,480
i think we will take digo as the last

2927
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,639
question for for this topic

2928
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:30,400
because we still have one presentation

2929
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:33,040
to go so diego please okay

2930
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,840
there's a comment on in the same line

2931
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:36,860
that what i was

2932
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:38,320
[Music]

2933
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:41,520
discussing with albert before

2934
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,840
my from our experience we have been

2935
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:44,960
trying to run

2936
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:48,000
well probably you could not call them uh

2937
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,239
digital twins but something that was

2938
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:52,719
able to generate uh realistic data sets

2939
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:53,520
for

2940
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,639
for training network control systems

2941
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:58,800
and now uh our

2942
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,000
experience

2943
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,560
is that uh there are

2944
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,560
two things that are essential one is is

2945
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,719
about repeatability you have to have a

2946
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:09,199
strong control of the digital train so

2947
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:10,960
you know what you are deploying every

2948
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,000
time

2949
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,360
and you know where you are putting the

2950
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:16,080
focus what that you are interested in

2951
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:19,040
collecting because a network is a it's a

2952
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:21,119
one it's not infinite

2953
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,840
but this is extremely wide and i'm

2954
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,960
certainly a manageable uh field of

2955
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,960
different parameters and configurations

2956
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,159
etc

2957
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:32,480
but so you have to have a very clear

2958
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,560
view of what you uh what you want and

2959
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,480
which which is your focus so this is

2960
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,480
about repeatability and control so you

2961
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,679
can repeat

2962
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:40,960
the important thing of the digital

2963
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,960
training is that you can execute

2964
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:45,040
several conditions with the control

2965
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,199
variations and so you can

2966
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:49,280
derive some

2967
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:52,719
insights or knowledge from whatever this

2968
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:54,320
is one thing the other thing is

2969
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:58,560
precisely the fact let me say is that

2970
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,400
given the size of the network and the

2971
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:03,119
different technologies involved etc

2972
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:04,480
believing that we are going to have

2973
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:06,239
something that is a full twing of the

2974
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:08,880
network is uh jerome has said is about

2975
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:10,480
the uh

2976
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,440
the

2977
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,520
close coupling between the real system

2978
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:16,000
and the uh and the model

2979
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,040
probably we had to choose depending on

2980
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,920
the on the case and the focus we will

2981
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,159
have to choose to uh different levels of

2982
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:26,560
uh of us of abstraction of different

2983
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,159
parts of the network

2984
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:31,520
to put focus on let's say on security

2985
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,760
aspects on

2986
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,480
delays induced by radio conditions or in

2987
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,119
congestion in some points etcetera

2988
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:40,960
and this is important as well so i

2989
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,639
believe that those are the

2990
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:45,440
these two basic characteristics repeat

2991
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,719
repeatability based on control and

2992
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,560
the uh the possibility of applying

2993
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:52,639
different levels of attra of abstraction

2994
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:55,440
depending on the uh the goals of the of

2995
01:51:55,440 --> 01:52:00,598
the twin runs so to say are essential

2996
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:07,199
thank you diego so um we capture that in

2997
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:08,320
a minute

2998
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:11,520
um my proposal is that we have um

2999
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,239
several questions and i think quite

3000
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:16,400
quite important and that will require

3001
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,239
let's say iteration from the group

3002
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:19,760
participants about

3003
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:23,679
collecting your opinions collecting uh

3004
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:26,639
references inputs to to this to to

3005
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:28,880
sustain our reflection on that

3006
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:31,119
so our proposal will be to continue to

3007
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:33,599
to develop the i mean collect answers to

3008
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,679
those questions and a bit structure

3009
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:39,920
uh let's say a research um

3010
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:42,480
a set of research questions on this

3011
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,239
as an activity for the group before

3012
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:45,920
before i mean uh understanding a bit

3013
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,920
better what we want what we want or what

3014
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:49,679
we could do in in the in the research

3015
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:51,199
group and even if it's beyond the

3016
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:54,239
research group uh how to appreciate so

3017
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:56,400
so thank you uh to all the participants

3018
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:59,280
and um i mean presenters uh people at

3019
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,480
comments

3020
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,560
for this topic of network digital twin

3021
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,719
uh this is not the end of the story but

3022
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:06,000
just the beginning

3023
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
um now we have

3024
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,520
our final

3025
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,679
presentation for today it's on a

3026
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:14,320
different topic something that is let's

3027
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,040
say

3028
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:19,040
as a quite long history in uh ietf rtf

3029
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:22,400
uh and there is some update that luis

3030
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:25,280
will represent now

3031
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:28,639
so thank you very much lauren uh yes i

3032
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:31,040
will present this um

3033
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,119
idea of plus evolution

3034
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,400
um

3035
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,599
the next slide please

3036
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:38,480
so

3037
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,840
a bit of background class states uh by

3038
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:43,280
creating linear architecture for sort

3039
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,199
with defined networking this was a work

3040
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:46,880
that was previously

3041
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:49,920
uh adopted in the former sdn uh research

3042
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,719
group that was moved to a independent

3043
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:55,520
submission stream after the dismantling

3044
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:58,480
of the sdnrg it was finally released

3045
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,880
three years ago as an nfc so it's

3046
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,960
publicly available and the main

3047
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,480
proposition of this architecture was

3048
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,719
essentially to decouple the the control

3049
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:08,400
of the services from the control of the

3050
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,960
transport network so allowing them to

3051
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:14,000
evolve independently and but even

3052
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,560
despite of being separated to we propose

3053
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:20,320
a tighter integration of both the strata

3054
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,800
in such a way that cooperates a program

3055
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,199
in a programmability manner

3056
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:27,839
next please

3057
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:31,599
next slide okay so as an overview so we

3058
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,280
defined the two different strata the

3059
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,800
services stratum and the transport

3060
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:36,719
stratum the purpose is clear so the

3061
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:38,159
service essentially to program the

3062
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:40,960
service and the capabilities of uh of

3063
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,560
the service itself and in the case of

3064
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,960
the transport stratum so all the

3065
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,800
functions related to connectivity to the

3066
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,320
delivery of information between

3067
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,760
different components of the of the

3068
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,239
service in each of the strata we define

3069
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:54,320
into three different planes uh control

3070
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:55,599
plane management plane and resource

3071
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:58,320
plane also the purpose is everything is

3072
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:01,679
clear so and again and despite of this

3073
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:03,599
differentiation in these two strata the

3074
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:06,639
area was to make them cooperative and in

3075
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:10,000
terms of programmability to interact for

3076
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,760
having the full programmability

3077
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,040
end-to-end

3078
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:15,520
next slide please

3079
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,440
so the motivation for the evolution of

3080
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:19,599
this architecture that we is

3081
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:21,520
what we are bringing today is

3082
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,760
essentially what you can see there are

3083
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,320
two main drivers for for this first that

3084
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,480
the network are evolving towards a

3085
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:31,199
tighter integration uh with the purpose

3086
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:33,199
of integrating compute environments so

3087
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:34,880
um

3088
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:36,560
we have seen here

3089
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:37,280
in

3090
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,000
in the itf this week uh initiatives like

3091
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,520
the both for the computer we're

3092
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:44,000
networking also another working in outer

3093
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,760
working group in this respect and so so

3094
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:46,960
more and more

3095
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,400
operators are deploying these compute

3096
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,000
capabilities but also are integrated

3097
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,599
with compute capabilities that are com

3098
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:54,080
are provided by hyperscalers by

3099
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:56,000
external players in such a way that

3100
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,920
networks are somehow transforming as a

3101
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,199
kind of fabric in their connecting

3102
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:02,480
compute environments apart from that and

3103
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:04,159
the network operations are started to be

3104
01:56:04,159 --> 01:56:08,480
complemented with ii ml techniques as

3105
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,320
clearly we know this from the work in

3106
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:13,360
nmrg so also we've seen the

3107
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:14,639
the need of intercooperating these

3108
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,880
capabilities into the in an operational

3109
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:19,199
manner to the existing network so the

3110
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,119
focus of this evolution and bringing

3111
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:23,280
these ideas here will be on management

3112
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:24,719
and control so we are not dealing with

3113
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:26,800
aspects about service placement and this

3114
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:28,400
kind of things so we were we want to

3115
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,639
focus on negan management and management

3116
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:32,560
and control so this is why we are

3117
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,560
bringing here this this work

3118
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:36,719
next please

3119
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:38,560
so essentially what the the way we are

3120
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:41,199
proposing the evolution of that former

3121
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:42,639
akita should be

3122
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:45,199
we keep the separation between service

3123
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:47,119
stratum and and transport stratum we

3124
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:49,840
somehow renamed testosterone to the idea

3125
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:52,320
of connectivity so thinking on

3126
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,239
how to forward the the formation between

3127
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:57,360
the different parties we introduce a new

3128
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,920
stratum referred as computer stratum

3129
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,400
again incorporating in this stratum the

3130
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,800
resource management and control planes

3131
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:08,080
and we define a new plane applicable for

3132
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:10,880
all the three strata which we call a

3133
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,560
learning plane and essentially would be

3134
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,719
devoted to the handling of data that

3135
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:16,639
could help on the operation liberating

3136
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:18,800
on the imml techniques

3137
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:21,280
that we will comment later on so next

3138
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,280
please

3139
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:25,760
so the idea would be for the computer

3140
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,599
strategy essentially to consider all

3141
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:30,320
that distributed computing capabilities

3142
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:33,440
and this what as mentioned would contain

3143
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:34,960
the the control management and resource

3144
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,960
planning related to the computing part

3145
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,400
some ideas that were probably good

3146
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,840
leverage on probably there is some

3147
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:41,520
previous work in alto as mentioned

3148
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:45,520
before but also the the some ideas

3149
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,599
of integrating compute environments at

3150
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:50,320
the end and then for the leaning plane

3151
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,080
this would be responsible of collecting

3152
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:54,400
processing and sharing relevant data for

3153
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,960
from the uh for each of the the strata

3154
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,400
for the service for the connectivity and

3155
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,480
for the compute and the idea would be to

3156
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:01,599
leverage on

3157
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:04,880
iiml techniques and maybe a some

3158
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:06,159
interesting framework to follow would be

3159
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:09,040
the one in mnrg as well about artificial

3160
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,040
intelligence and also maybe considering

3161
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,520
other outcomes from itf as would be the

3162
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,520
the service assurance models and so for

3163
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,920
feeding all this stuff and helping on

3164
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,960
the operation of of the network so next

3165
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:23,199
please

3166
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:25,119
so exploitation research directions that

3167
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:27,119
we do for c there were some of them in

3168
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:29,599
the draft actually uh the ones that in

3169
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:31,760
the first ballot so some work could be

3170
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:33,360
maybe about a communication means or

3171
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:34,800
interfaces between the strata and the

3172
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,639
planes the preliminary scenarios

3173
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:38,400
including legacy ones so understand how

3174
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,119
this

3175
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:41,679
evolved architecture could be could fit

3176
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:43,840
potential use cases or the link with

3177
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:45,840
ongoing activities in an mrg clearly the

3178
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,280
intent-based

3179
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:48,400
activities so that difficult

3180
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:49,840
intelligence could have some some

3181
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,040
fitting here as well we we think that

3182
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,679
would be the case additional research

3183
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:57,040
lines maybe could be explored normal

3184
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,360
architectural approaches uh potentially

3185
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:00,800
maybe as an example the boost

3186
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,320
architecture like the service based

3187
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:05,040
architecture in 3dbp or what is what is

3188
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:06,960
called cloud-based architecture could be

3189
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,719
probably thing a ways of evolving

3190
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:11,199
architecture essentially how we in

3191
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:14,159
communicate between the planes

3192
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:15,840
a potential line as well would be in the

3193
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:18,239
domain apis between the different or

3194
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:20,880
strata or even in the within a single

3195
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:23,280
stratum so further developing the ideas

3196
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:24,960
that we already uh some of them we

3197
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:28,080
expose in a previous draft also in nmrg

3198
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:30,239
exploring the base apis or approaches

3199
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:32,320
for the learning plane specifically so

3200
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:35,119
how we could activate or consume the

3201
01:59:35,119 --> 01:59:36,400
information that could come from the

3202
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,880
learning plan and maybe also even

3203
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,320
working on data models or even

3204
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,159
ontologies for the change

3205
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:43,840
for exchanging and aggregating

3206
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,760
information that could relevant for the

3207
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:47,199
operation of the

3208
01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:49,360
of the system of the network at the end

3209
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:52,159
so next please

3210
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:56,960
so as last steps so we would like to set

3211
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:58,400
the scope of the draft aligned with the

3212
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,480
scope of nmig we think that this could

3213
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:03,040
be the the proper host for for this uh

3214
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,719
architectural evolution so we would like

3215
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:06,960
to do some research in this respect

3216
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,880
we would like also to have some feedback

3217
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:09,840
or

3218
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,199
at least to see if there is interest

3219
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:12,400
from the research group

3220
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:14,960
on some of the aspects he had commented

3221
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,960
we already received some initial

3222
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,520
feedback i met by carlos sandiego that

3223
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,440
was publicly expressed in the mailing

3224
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,679
list but also some informal

3225
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:26,639
feedback from pedranjin that was given

3226
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:29,599
offline and the idea is yeah with all

3227
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:31,440
that we could collect and the the

3228
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,119
indications from the chairs to prepare

3229
02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:35,040
new and more detailed versions for next

3230
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:36,639
itf and and

3231
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:38,400
basically understand if this could fit

3232
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,679
here or

3233
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:43,760
or or not at all so thanks so much

3234
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,560
thanks a lot luis for very very

3235
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,159
efficient uh

3236
02:00:48,159 --> 02:00:50,880
and conscious of the time um

3237
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:52,960
general comment okay we may have maybe

3238
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:54,400
more time to

3239
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:55,840
bring this discussion on the mailing

3240
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,719
list a general recommendation like i

3241
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:01,920
already made it to you previously

3242
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:04,159
on some aspect of this week i see that

3243
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:06,719
there is a relationship with

3244
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:08,639
the topic investigating in the core in

3245
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:11,520
research group so uh i'm not saying that

3246
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:12,800
it should be

3247
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,639
handled only in the coin research group

3248
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:16,639
but because you put what what is the

3249
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:18,560
scope of energy with respect to this

3250
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:21,119
work but in your let's say in your

3251
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:22,480
iteration of

3252
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:25,119
on this work uh please consider to try

3253
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:28,000
to laze uh with activities in coin to

3254
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,920
understand also what they could bring to

3255
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:31,840
to this discussion and what will fit

3256
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,679
more into the scope of coin versus what

3257
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:35,599
could be the specific scope to be

3258
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:37,920
addressed in energy you see it's it's uh

3259
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,280
it's really like uh

3260
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:41,440
imagine that this is a this is a central

3261
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:42,800
topic for you

3262
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:43,840
uh

3263
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,520
what an energy could be the good place

3264
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:47,920
to do something and what could be maybe

3265
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:51,119
better handled in coin or elsewhere

3266
02:01:51,119 --> 02:01:53,360
but just as a question of course

3267
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:55,598
okay

3268
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:01,119
so we have to to conclude the meeting uh

3269
02:02:01,119 --> 02:02:02,159
thank you everyone for your

3270
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:03,920
participation i think it was i mean i

3271
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:05,760
appreciated the the discussion we had

3272
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:07,599
today especially the topic on network

3273
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:09,520
digital trend that was uh

3274
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,119
uh

3275
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:13,360
more central to to our agenda today so

3276
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,760
we tried to concentrate on such topics

3277
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:19,040
in the future we have a lot a lot uh

3278
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:21,599
on the agenda i mean all the uh the work

3279
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:23,920
stream of energy so uh please continue

3280
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,679
the interactions i

3281
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:27,760
really miss not being in vienna but i

3282
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:29,520
see people in the room so please

3283
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,599
continue the discussion there uh

3284
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:32,960
continue the discussion on the mailing

3285
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:35,119
list and to all offers uh thank you for

3286
02:02:35,119 --> 02:02:37,119
your investigative investment in the in

3287
02:02:37,119 --> 02:02:39,920
the work and i see that we have a lot of

3288
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:42,480
uh future version of of the draft uh to

3289
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,320
be flowing in the research group so

3290
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,000
thank you everyone jerome if you have

3291
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,760
any last word of conclusions the floor

3292
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:48,639
is here

3293
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:50,400
just want to say uh thank you also

3294
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,080
around thank you lauren so thank you

3295
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:54,800
diego for local backup and yes uh how to

3296
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:58,719
make you a so our close future in real

3297
02:02:58,719 --> 02:03:01,040
real person yeah thank you all and have

3298
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,199
a nice day

3299
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:07,000
thank you bye everyone

3300
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:26,920
move around

3301
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,480
yeah no you know

3302
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:45,119
that's the curse of the current because

3303
02:03:45,119 --> 02:03:46,960
in the past you could say

3304
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:51,960
no i'm not going to join you because
