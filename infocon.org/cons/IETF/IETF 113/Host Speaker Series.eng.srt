1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,160
okay

2
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,600
okay folks uh

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,119
sorry for the delay

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,680
thank you very much for coming to the

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,240
host tech talk this is shipping seo from

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,760
huawei

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
um

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,880
there are a million ipv6 talks right so

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,040
i first want to answer the question why

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
you should also listen to this one

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,680
and the reason is that

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,480
that

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,039
i think that most ipv6 talks are given

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,280
by ipv6 supporters

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,760
and usually the ipv6 supporters only

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,559
tell you the good thing about ipv6

17
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,239
and i think that what's unique in

18
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,079
today's presentation

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,480
is that we are going to talk about a lot

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,159
of the challenges

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,080
facing ipv6

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,880
and the reason why i feel that this is

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,799
important and useful

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,880
is that

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,960
just like you know nobody is perfect no

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,360
technology is perfect you know every

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,840
technology have certain problems

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,320
and in order to get all the people on

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,200
board

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,320
to deploy ipv6 we really need to

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,799
acknowledge the challenges certain

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,240
challenges facing ipv6 document the

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
challenges um

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,159
possibly provide a guideline and i think

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,479
that eric linker kind of like set a good

36
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,079
example for us in rfc 1999

37
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,960
because i've seen 1999 basically

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,479
document all the ipv6 security excels

39
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,600
and provide guidelines this way you know

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,040
people

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
feel more confident like oh you know

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,759
ietf no other issues and you know they

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,320
are solving this is actually you know

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
provide more confidence not less

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,399
confidence

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,520
so with that um

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,758
[Music]

48
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,599
i really want to say that we spent a lot

49
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,239
of time presenting uh preparing for

50
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,200
these

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
uh presentations and a lot of people

52
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,280
providing a lot of uh

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
you know either statistics or provide a

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
local review and the list is long and

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,959
here i really again want to thank eric

56
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,280
binker because he provided a lot of you

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,959
know very detailed feedbacks

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,959
so

59
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
the first part is the momentum um

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,200
while this is both for the ipv6

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,239
supporters and the ipv6 deniers and by

62
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,239
ipv69 i really have no pixel respect you

63
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,879
know just an easier name to to refer to

64
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,959
the camp

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
i know that the ipv6

66
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,519
for example in the nano

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,440
in the nano mailing leaks there was a

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
big debate this month

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,599
about ipv6 and

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,519
some people are complaining that our

71
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,280
ipv6 is not easy to deploy there's no

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,720
user demand etc

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
one will acknowledge that later here we

74
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
want to say that you know for many of

75
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,720
these

76
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,440
are you aware of the ipv6 progress

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
in recent years because 10 years ago if

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
you are consuming ipv6 you are more or

79
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,400
less justified because at that time

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,360
there's almost zero ipv6 users

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,879
but now

82
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,799
according to these google stats we

83
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,560
already have 36 percent ipv6 user

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,200
um some people argue that actually

85
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,760
due to the way google called the users

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,560
many ipv6 users in china are actually

87
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,440
mixed

88
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
so if you count e also the users in

89
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,200
china it could be as high as 45 percent

90
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,319
based on etsi started

91
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,280
but

92
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,920
while ipv6 go very fast

93
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,159
the

94
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,519
the

95
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,239
it's very uneven and this will have a

96
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,720
major implication later that we will

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,760
talk about so what's driving these ipv6

98
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,040
momentums

99
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
according to jeff houston this is you

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
know the gdp per capita you know which

101
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,400
country usually are more enthusiastic in

102
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,040
doing ipv6 the user grows like a

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,400
reliance on the ipb for authorities

104
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,639
and also the competition

105
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,960
but it's not just this it's not just

106
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,520
this and here we would like to offer our

107
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,720
perspective

108
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,400
other you know strong momentum on ipv6

109
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,639
the first one is that we believe that

110
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,440
the

111
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,040
loyaltineness

112
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,160
of

113
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,120
ipv6 value chain is something very

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
important because

115
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,479
the ue's the network and the application

116
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,360
trend

117
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,000
is finally ready

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
because 10 years ago if you know some of

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,560
these the content are not already then

120
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,880
even if operators deploy ipv6 you are

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,360
not going to get much benefit but now

122
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
it's very different

123
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,039
and here we list some of the major

124
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,600
milestones but the slide is busy so you

125
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
don't need to read that all i want you

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,360
to know is that

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,800
it's summarized in these two blue bars

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,560
by 2011 ietf lastly you get the

129
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,320
solution ready

130
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,280
um by 2017

131
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,800
the ues the ues and the big application

132
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
like you know google netflix are already

133
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
and this year we believe that there is

134
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,560
another important milestone that many

135
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,080
people may not realize yet is the public

136
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,440
cloud support of ipv6 like as

137
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,840
aws these are important we will talk

138
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,479
about why you know this is this may be

139
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,359
quite significant

140
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,160
and then on the value trend

141
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,880
we are seeing that the network

142
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,800
is still slightly behind the ue um

143
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
the

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,199
content

145
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,039
and if you are interested i will not go

146
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,120
into detail if you are interested even

147
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
later we can discuss why another network

148
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,600
is 42 percent how we're computing that

149
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
is that

150
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,800
um another point is that

151
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,520
i don't know whether the ipv6 the denier

152
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,479
realized that the price of ipv4 is going

153
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,360
up so quickly and specifically the price

154
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
doubled last year

155
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,639
and if you call it long 2014

156
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,680
it already increased seven times

157
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
so if you the world on ipv4 you may have

158
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
to spend a lot more money if you have to

159
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
buy ip

160
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,639
default address or for some operator

161
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,520
they are even considering you know going

162
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,639
to ipv6 quickly and while ipv4 you know

163
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,840
price is very high they can sell their

164
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,800
ipv4 address this is important one

165
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,680
and then the public ipv6 wait this is

166
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,240
the kind of the other momentum that we

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,599
saw

168
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,560
um

169
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
one is this

170
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,680
just now we mentioned that aws ages

171
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
support

172
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,680
of ipv6 why we believe that this is uh

173
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,919
maybe very important

174
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
we when we look at the operators you

175
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,199
know the big operating six terms the

176
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,440
small and medium enterprise

177
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,560
we find that small and medium enterprise

178
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
have the least motivation

179
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,520
to move to ipv6

180
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
because they they have a very you know

181
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
they don't need mainly address

182
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,360
and also they may not have the technical

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,080
expertise to make the move

184
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,639
so usually you know we if we look at the

185
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,639
sme you know there's a huge number of

186
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,160
sme they're simply in ipv4 but we

187
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,680
believe that when these you know aws as

188
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,400
when they support ipv6 and as the you

189
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,120
know

190
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
sme go to the cloud you know uh aws may

191
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
enable them to move to ipv6 very quickly

192
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,720
in the past they may have to do a lot of

193
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,440
work themselves but now they simply

194
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,560
select ipv4 or ipv6 and if they select

195
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
ipv6 they go ipv6 so we may

196
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
know today in the v6

197
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,360
working group that discussion will

198
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,599
you know how to move the sme and we

199
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,360
believe that this may be

200
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,799
a very big momentum and then on the iot

201
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
you probably see the number already

202
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,279
there's a lot of iot device

203
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,279
then 5g

204
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,800
bring new beo a new opportunity and then

205
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,360
obviously there's these innovations on

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
top of ip

207
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,120
v6 srb6 and other things provide better

208
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,360
traffic engineering network programming

209
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,800
etc

210
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,680
so

211
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,800
for the people who don't believe in ipv6

212
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,680
i think

213
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,080
we really want to

214
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,399
these are some of the recent progress

215
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,560
not to mention the for example the big

216
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,240
government proves even though u.s

217
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,200
government is pushing towards ipv6

218
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,760
chinese government is fixing but i guess

219
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,080
maybe ietf people don't want government

220
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,160
regulation so i avoid them here

221
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,320
and the second part i think the first

222
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
part is more to the ipv69

223
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,320
and the second part is more to the ipv6

224
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
supporters

225
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
and here what we want to say is that for

226
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
the ipv6 supporters

227
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,959
there

228
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,279
there really are more challenges than

229
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,000
you think because you know we as the the

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
supporters sometimes we feel that oh you

231
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,360
know

232
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,399
our work ietf work is done you know

233
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,800
these people are not doing ipv6 just

234
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
because of the lack of the

235
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,200
motivation or because they are they are

236
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,920
saying all kinds of skills you know i am

237
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,480
completely ready and what i want to say

238
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,880
here is that yeah we are we are quite

239
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,079
ready but not completely and let's see

240
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,640
so first this is a

241
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,480
survey from every nic it's done in 2017.

242
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,800
you can say that oh 2017 maybe too old

243
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
but actually you know based on what i

244
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
hear from other industry forum if i

245
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,680
compare it to some of the ipv6

246
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
challenges in

247
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,920
in december last year

248
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,079
it didn't change that much and really uh

249
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,800
here i think it may be difficult for you

250
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,720
to to see

251
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,600
uh other things but i just want to

252
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
kind of like quickly classify them

253
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,519
into four categories one is motivation i

254
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,399
think that for ipv6 this motivation is

255
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,200
always one of the biggest uh xu

256
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,519
okay you know my end user don't care

257
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,480
about ipv6 it's a lot of work so you

258
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,279
know why supply so things like this and

259
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,600
then knowledge is also a big part you

260
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,440
know okay you know i don't understand

261
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,320
ipv6 there's so many new protocols

262
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,519
it's difficult so i think the big car

263
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,760
ecosystem is the value train that we

264
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,160
talked about the ues you know is my

265
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
that's my cp support ipv6 and the

266
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,160
network the routers etc

267
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,399
and then technology is what's closely

268
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,120
related to ietf that we will focus on

269
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,200
today

270
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,880
so regarding this motivation knowledge i

271
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,160
think that you know these uh slides look

272
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,360
a little

273
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,399
deeper

274
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,240
i think that maybe

275
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,560
we focus on the the more technical part

276
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,600
is the technology is the technology so

277
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,680
that the legacy device

278
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
is the ipv6 the network management

279
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,839
system i think generally this is a field

280
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,959
that you know ipv6 network management

281
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,880
compared to ipv4

282
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,959
i think that you know there's still

283
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,079
some work to do and the oam also may be

284
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,279
not as mature these are some of the you

285
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,079
know common complaints from the field

286
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,160
but we want to say that yes

287
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,480
these are issues but you know

288
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,800
the industry largely you know taking uh

289
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
action to

290
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
to deal with them so regarding the

291
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,240
motivation and knowledge you know

292
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,000
leading operators are selling that

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
experience and then you know there's

294
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,959
many ipv6 forums councils

295
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,920
i think as far as i know the uk ipv6

296
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,240
council is is

297
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,160
especially you know active and they're

298
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,079
doing a lot of book work

299
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,920
and then for the

300
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,720
ecosystem i think they will so clearly

301
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,320
thank you know

302
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,079
google amazon i think microsoft

303
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,040
they really did a lot of work at all

304
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,440
they really did a lot of work to move

305
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,680
the industry towards

306
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,959
ipv6 and for the last part for the last

307
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,639
part we are going to talk about the

308
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,480
technical challenge i think that it's

309
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,399
the focus of our

310
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,519
presentation today

311
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,320
so uh before we talk about the bad

312
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,399
things uh first let's uh

313
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,240
let's say that you know ietf has done a

314
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,279
lot so you know this is not to to

315
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,279
complain this is not to to complain but

316
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,200
even though that we have done a lot i

317
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,639
think that there are remaining

318
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,680
challenges remaining challenges

319
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,560
um

320
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
so the first one i think that you know

321
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,800
to compare the ipv6 performance versus

322
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,399
ipv4

323
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,360
uh may be uh very relevant and more

324
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,160
telling because between ipv6 and ipv4

325
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
there are so many things that you can

326
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,000
compare there's so many things that you

327
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,320
can compare for example neighbor

328
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,360
discovery is very different from app but

329
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
we believe that you know performance is

330
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,959
really the

331
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,720
very important or maybe the most

332
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,839
important you know

333
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,800
kpi so

334
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,360
the first one is regarding the raw chip

335
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
time

336
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,839
the latency

337
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,959
so as you can see okay you can see here

338
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,600
over the years the

339
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
the

340
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,160
ipv6 road trip time

341
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,480
is you know constantly improving it's

342
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,320
constantly improving

343
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,880
but today it's the old you know 2.5

344
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,839
millisecond higher than ipv4

345
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,560
than ipv4 but this is what average this

346
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,399
is whatever right you know later i will

347
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,560
provide you know kind of like the

348
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,760
the the grain of salt on my own you know

349
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
uh this data and again this is based on

350
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,399
jeff houston's status in ap nics

351
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,320
there are you know in the industry there

352
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,399
are some other statistics

353
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,480
like linker that all have some statics

354
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,279
right ncc have statics etc

355
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,920
but we or at least i personally believe

356
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
that maybe ap nix data is more

357
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,000
systematic so we are

358
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,240
so i think that the first is that you

359
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,920
know ipv6 and ipv4 is very very close

360
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,399
but it's slightly higher on a worldwide

361
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,959
average scale

362
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,320
so uh i think a very good question to us

363
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,639
here is that what are the top three

364
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,199
factors leading to this improvement why

365
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,880
you know over the years why this is

366
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,240
improving and if we understand what are

367
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,880
contributing to this improvement then i

368
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,399
think that you know we can provide a

369
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,399
guideline for other operators that oh

370
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,560
you know do this from day one

371
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,800
then you know you can you can you know

372
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,680
avoid

373
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,199
certain things

374
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,800
so this is the

375
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
logic time the second one is the packet

376
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,120
loss

377
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,079
rate

378
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,040
and we find that the data here is really

379
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
inconclusive

380
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,720
we provide you know two data points here

381
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,480
the first one is from this uh hindavi um

382
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,120
it reported ipv6 plr actually uh lower

383
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,440
than uh ipv4

384
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,839
and this is they they did the management

385
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,040
based on one way of management from

386
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,120
from china

387
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,440
and it says that you know for them they

388
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,920
find out that ipv6

389
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,360
packet loss rate is 0.25 percent

390
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,880
um for ipv4 is 0.33

391
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,680
so ipv6 performs slightly better they

392
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,639
also have some you know distribution

393
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,079
so in the asia is is much better it's

394
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,079
all clearly better

395
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,680
ipv6 and ipv4 and for other regions they

396
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,920
are more or less seeming more or less

397
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,959
similar

398
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,639
and then we also

399
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,360
that's one data point on one angle and

400
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,759
then on the right hand side

401
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,680
we are seeing kind of like a different

402
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,560
result so here we are citing you know

403
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,279
rfc 7872

404
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,000
by i think by fernando by zhang lincoln

405
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,839
here and now i think recently uh

406
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,400
eric winker also have the so-called jerk

407
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,439
james

408
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,480
talking about some new management on

409
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
on these like uh extension headers

410
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,480
but

411
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,760
uh the the long story short the result

412
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,880
is that you know in 2017

413
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,439
the packing loss rate for for the

414
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,359
plastic waste fragmentation extremely

415
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,079
high 21 percent and even last year it's

416
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,000
still eight percent it improves a lot

417
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,840
but it's still very high

418
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,600
um because we heard from many operators

419
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,080
we heard from many operators like their

420
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,160
ipv for

421
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
packet loss rate or their packet loss

422
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,440
rate is about 0.1 percent and we take it

423
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,240
as ipv4 because mainly most traffic is

424
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
still ipv4

425
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
um but you know there's really i think

426
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,000
that we find in the industry but there

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,760
is no data on ipv6 packet glossary or at

428
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,200
least ap nic didn't provide

429
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
so if anybody have this data we would

430
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,720
love to hear from you

431
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,440
so if we take it from the the first

432
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,039
study at

433
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:16,160
02.5 percent then ipv6 is uh higher than

434
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,000
ipd4 but again this is inconclusive

435
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,840
um we

436
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,400
we we don't know uh

437
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,280
how much of this overall

438
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,120
packet loss rate is coming from those

439
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,280
fragmentation extinction headers etc we

440
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,360
believe that this would be uh you know

441
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,160
something good to to find out

442
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,440
um

443
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
we we

444
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,640
we really feel that you know if we can

445
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,880
dig into this and find out why you know

446
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,400
ipv6 is losing package etc again this

447
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,600
would help

448
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,880
will help

449
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,760
to to improve the performance and make

450
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,280
the the life of those deployer a little

451
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,320
easier

452
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,760
and the third one is the tcp failure rig

453
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,080
again we can see that the the blue one

454
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,720
the green one is ipv6 and then the other

455
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,960
is v4 we can see that over time

456
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
the

457
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
ipv6 tcp failure rate is like again

458
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
constantly improving

459
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,600
but i think that based on the data uh

460
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,120
today

461
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,679
ap nick it's still you know 0.96 percent

462
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,160
and ipv4 you know depending on how you

463
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
look like it may be like

464
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
0.25 percent or

465
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
some people jeff houston said oh it's

466
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,960
almost like zero percent so you know

467
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
ipv4 is almost

468
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,120
successful but anyhow i think that the

469
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,960
conclusion is the same

470
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,640
tcp failure

471
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,760
ipv6 is higher

472
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,480
so

473
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,799
the question is that is it because of

474
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,960
the higher packet loss really

475
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,160
of ipv6 i think that this certainly you

476
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,039
know if you have a higher ipv6

477
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,080
plr it's quite likely that the tcp

478
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,640
failure rate will also be higher

479
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,919
and then because quick is using more and

480
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,039
more

481
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,840
in addition to bill to measuring tcp

482
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,720
failure

483
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,520
we also be measuring quick as well

484
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,360
so i think that these are some of the

485
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
good questions

486
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,400
um

487
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,880
okay you know me as a supporter

488
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,400
ipv6 supporter talking about ipv6

489
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,799
challenges here and some people say that

490
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,360
oh they they may be concerned that okay

491
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,600
you know i come to the conclusion that

492
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,480
we shouldn't do ipv6 and i want to tell

493
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,799
you that this is not the case because

494
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,679
again

495
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,240
that just now what we're presenting is

496
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,200
the worldwide average

497
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
whatever it can

498
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,320
you know the average can hide a lot of

499
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,039
things can hide a lot of things and if

500
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,200
we look at the data you know more

501
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
carefully we will see that you know the

502
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,919
world average can be jerked out by a

503
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,799
region badly and again this is the same

504
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,960
steps from ap nick

505
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
you'll see that you know

506
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
the whole world

507
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,799
uh the rtt of uh ipv6 is slightly higher

508
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,799
but it's largely you know because of you

509
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,480
know swing me

510
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,559
and if you look at the world you know

511
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
american and europe actually you know

512
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,080
ipv6 perform better than ipv4

513
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,960
so i i really feel that these data are

514
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,360
useful for

515
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,480
for communicating with the ipv6 deniers

516
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,799
you know when they say that oh it's bad

517
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,280
you can you you you have the stats to to

518
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,600
tell them what uh if you look deeper

519
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,880
what's the case

520
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,760
and also there are reports that

521
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,640
ipv6 can perform better in

522
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,600
enterprises for example we provide two

523
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,159
references here you know

524
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,720
apple at one place is claiming that you

525
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,919
know ipv6 can be you know 40 percent

526
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,200
better

527
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,080
in the in the data center again you know

528
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
we provided the reference here you can

529
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,039
check out and facebook is also very

530
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,000
enthusiastic in in

531
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,240
promoting ipv6 so i think the point here

532
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,039
our real point our real point here is

533
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,760
that

534
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,320
ipv6 can perform better than ipv4

535
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,600
if

536
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,240
if you you have a lot of talent if you

537
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,120
can do it you know correctly but it's

538
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,840
not always easy this is this is a

539
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,480
complicated machine and if you install

540
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,840
it you know

541
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,559
correctly you operate it correctly then

542
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,880
you perform better than uh

543
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,840
ipv4 but because it's due to its

544
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,440
complexity

545
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,360
you may make mistakes and if you make

546
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,640
mistakes then it don't work uh take work

547
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
so i think that this is the concern that

548
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,200
we want to want to provide

549
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,039
um

550
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,360
as a consequence i think that this is

551
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,120
also another thing that i find

552
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,640
as a big surprise to me last year and it

553
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,360
may actually be a big surprise to many

554
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
ipv6 bathrooms

555
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,400
is that

556
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
many operators

557
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,960
uh ipv6 deployment are actually in

558
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,600
overlay and in the underlay in the

559
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,200
router et cetera they're actually

560
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,559
tunneling ipv6 in nprs etc

561
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,120
so you know when the operator tells you

562
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,520
that oh i do deal stack

563
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,159
you think that you know their routers

564
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,679
are transporting ipv6 traffic natively

565
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,600
you think that their underlay is also

566
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
dual stack but that may not be the case

567
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
that may not be the case this is a big

568
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,960
surprise for me

569
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,760
last year so first of all let's uh let

570
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,679
me clarify what's overlay and what

571
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,159
underlay i think this is this is a

572
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,480
notion it's applicable to operators and

573
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,440
to some extent also applicable to

574
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
data center but it's not applicable to

575
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,400
for enterprise if you are not providing

576
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,720
a cervix to other people you really

577
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,559
don't have this like distinction between

578
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,200
overlay and underlay but any household

579
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,400
operator

580
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,200
overlay is the service layer and it

581
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,080
involved the the user device

582
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,640
and also the mobile gateway or bng or

583
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
etc this is your your kind of like your

584
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,840
service layer and then underlays your

585
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,120
routers etc is the the the to send the

586
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,440
send the package

587
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,480
um

588
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,600
because ipv6 is i think the the number

589
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,960
one uh

590
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240
reason is to address this

591
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
address sorted you know to provide

592
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,799
enough address and if to do that then

593
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,840
ipv6 the overlay is sufficient

594
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,400
it's sufficient and why operators don't

595
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,039
want to you know many operators

596
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,159
don't do

597
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,279
native ipv b6 packaging talk is because

598
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,400
if your router is still stacked

599
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,039
really deals that then you need a

600
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,440
a control plane management claim data

601
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,400
playing for ipv4 you have need a

602
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,080
separate play

603
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,760
for ipv6

604
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,600
however if you just tunnel ipv6 packet

605
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,200
inside ipv4 then you only need a single

606
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,000
you know data and controller management

607
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,880
click so many operators feel that okay

608
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,840
you know

609
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,240
actually it will be easier for me to

610
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,799
maintain just one per plane then two

611
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,919
separate play and there are many of them

612
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,240
are using 6pe set

613
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,360
so

614
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,159
uh some of the ipv6 veterans thought

615
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:48,880
that

616
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,240
operators ipv6 is largely down but this

617
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,000
is really not the case first there are

618
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,039
many big operators still doing ipv4 and

619
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,520
even for those already deployed ipv6

620
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
that ipv6 may still just in the overlay

621
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,240
not much in the underlay so this is

622
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,440
again you know back to the question that

623
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,840
we need to make ipv6 perform better we

624
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,919
need to identify the challenges and make

625
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,600
ipv6 perform better than ipv4 otherwise

626
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
otherwise you know there are still a big

627
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,159
part of operator network playing

628
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,240
remaining

629
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,080
you know there are there are many

630
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,440
consequences

631
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,200
so here uh

632
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,320
how to

633
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,320
make ipv6 perform better than ipv4

634
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,400
there are these answers the first two

635
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,480
came from jeff houston

636
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,240
the first two point that came from jeff

637
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,320
houston he actually have three points

638
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,720
but i had to delete one point because

639
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,480
you know that could receive a lot of

640
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,039
protest the deleted point is that he

641
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,400
said that you should avoid stateful

642
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,720
ipv4 to ipv6 transition

643
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,760
and then

644
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,360
kind of like you know is clued for

645
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,600
example four four six four x lab

646
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,919
etcetera i'll receive a lot of you know

647
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,400
protests from that point so you know in

648
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,320
the end i delete it

649
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,679
um

650
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,000
there are other points the the next five

651
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,039
points you know below the below the the

652
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,159
white space the the other six points are

653
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,399
the five points are you know based on

654
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,520
our analysis first is move content

655
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,799
closer to end user this will improve

656
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,360
both ipv4 performance and ipv6

657
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,760
performance but there are data showing

658
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,080
that you know the improvement for ipv6

659
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,279
is actually

660
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,840
uh bigger than for ipv4 so if it

661
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,520
close the gap or even you know

662
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,840
change the change the wind

663
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
there are some explanations and but we

664
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,000
don't have the time to go into detail

665
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,159
why this is the case

666
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,120
increase link mpu if you can and change

667
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,279
the choose the tcp mss these are all to

668
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,440
avoid trying to avoid fragmentation

669
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,279
because of fragmentation if it happened

670
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,159
the ego ego caused very high packet loss

671
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,159
rate and then there's this like

672
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,880
announcing ipv6 routes and a lot

673
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,679
filtering and jeff houston provided some

674
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,640
example that you know if you don't do it

675
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,480
you basically provide for example that

676
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,320
between australia and singapore ipv4 is

677
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,200
australia to singapore directly back to

678
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,039
to australia but for ipv6 pakistan

679
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,480
australia to singapore to germany to us

680
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,080
and then back to australia then

681
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,320
obviously you're going to have a lot

682
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,120
higher uh

683
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,919
roadship delay and possibly a packet

684
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,000
loss and then there's this package

685
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
filtering

686
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,880
i would say that here we provide some

687
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,720
some references some references

688
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,080
but

689
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,399
more work probably need to be done or at

690
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,200
least even should you know discuss and

691
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,679
document these challenges and then

692
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,919
provide guidelines provide a guideline

693
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,159
on all of these you know what can make

694
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,600
ipv6

695
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,039
better

696
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,320
so this is the second part and the third

697
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,200
part is looking forward as we said

698
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,039
if you look at the world average it

699
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,360
seems like ipv6 seems to be a little

700
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,480
worse but if you look at you know deeper

701
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,840
actually

702
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,440
as we say if you do ipv6 correctly ipv6

703
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,520
can perform better than ipv4 just like

704
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,320
in america and in europe

705
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,279
so

706
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,320
if we look at the the world today i know

707
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,240
that this is a busy slide and you will

708
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,320
not be able to tell the company or read

709
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,640
the small numbers i think that there are

710
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,799
only two impressions that i want to get

711
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,120
want you to get from this slide first is

712
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,240
that there are many companies with very

713
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,799
high ipv6

714
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,120
user percentage already

715
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,279
starting from the you know the top one

716
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,640
is 100 ipv6 and even the bottom one is

717
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,559
still like 57

718
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,960
it's still 57

719
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
um as we said

720
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,000
these are companies that do ipv6

721
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,790
correctly and benefit from it

722
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,559
[Music]

723
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,440
they can already move to ipv6 only they

724
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,559
can already to move to ipv6 only and

725
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,200
brian carpenter told me that you know

726
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,520
every time you talk about ipv6 only you

727
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,000
should immediately say that ipv4 as a

728
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,880
service over ipv6 because otherwise

729
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,399
people will say that oh this guy is a

730
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,600
lyrical how how how can you be you know

731
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,039
ipv4 will stay for many many years they

732
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,200
thought that ipv6 only means that no

733
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,600
ipv4 but it's not the case it just means

734
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,480
that you know ipv4 will be long as a

735
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,360
cervix over ipv6 but it will disappear

736
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,520
from the infrastructure

737
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,679
layer so it's the the time to to do so

738
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,919
and here you know will be a little bit

739
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,519
more specific

740
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,320
so at least from operator perspective

741
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
you know facebook already done it i

742
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,159
think that the hyper scale

743
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,399
the hyper skill have a lot of talent

744
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,000
they probably have you know the best

745
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,559
talent in the industry and they have no

746
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,679
problem you know they can they they

747
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,960
they they can do uh whatever

748
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,679
but for some operators it may not be so

749
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,679
clear so we're kind of like you know

750
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,360
draw some picture

751
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,600
um i think like the mobile one we kind

752
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,679
of like use four six four excellent as

753
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,240
an example and the first one is a little

754
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,519
bit like a

755
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,480
you know

756
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,240
quite dislike or you know one of those

757
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,960
solutions but the the real difference is

758
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,360
i think ipv6 only at the moment in the

759
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,880
industry

760
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,440
for some people it doesn't mean the ipv4

761
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,360
as a cervix again you know it's just in

762
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,679
the overlay and here we want to make

763
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,480
sure that you know by ipv6 only we not

764
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,720
only mean overlay we really mean you

765
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,600
know underlay and the ipv4

766
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,960
the packet will be tunneling inside ipv6

767
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,600
will be finally inside ipv6 we believe

768
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,760
that this will further improve

769
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,559
the performance of ipv6 and make it

770
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,440
better than ipv4

771
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,360
so this is

772
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,159
largely the the the kind of like

773
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,559
the last slide before sung murray is

774
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,159
that

775
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,480
way

776
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,360
the difference between these one and the

777
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,919
ipv6 overlaid is that we believe that

778
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,559
you know the if you do do the today's

779
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,320
way ipv6 overlay plus ipv4 underlay you

780
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,240
are basically you you have no exit

781
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,440
strategy

782
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,960
because you your underlay is stuck even

783
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,799
though that your ipv6 traffic is

784
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,120
increasing but you know you you don't

785
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,919
change your underlay and

786
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,320
you always have you know two protocols

787
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,919
but even though if you tunnel your ipv6

788
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,480
traffic ipv4 over ipv6 because ipv4 is

789
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,440
is

790
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,120
becoming a smaller and smaller

791
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,600
percentage then you know one day you can

792
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,159
finally just purely ipe

793
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,080
purely ipv6 and really this requires

794
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,240
solving some of the challenges that we

795
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,919
talked about in this

796
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,679
uh presentation

797
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,170
um

798
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,519
[Music]

799
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,480
um

800
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,760
really we need the help of ietf and the

801
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,080
leading operators we really need first

802
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,799
we need to document all the challenges

803
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,960
and provide a guideline

804
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,240
so this brings me to the summary again

805
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,120
we want to emphasize with our feelings

806
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,399
it's like a sophisticated machine only

807
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,600
if you can install and operate it well

808
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,320
it will be better than ipv4 otherwise it

809
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,960
can be worse then it can be worse than

810
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,559
ipv4 and in this aspect we really need

811
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,200
you know ietf to kind of like provide

812
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,840
kind of like better user guideline to

813
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,480
make sure that you know uh people

814
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,559
will have a higher chance of you know

815
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,360
install and operate it

816
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,640
correctly

817
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,240
um

818
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,119
these if we do this then we can we can

819
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,639
you know accelerate uh move to ipv6 and

820
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,719
ipv6 only and here we will specifically

821
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,560
list some topics

822
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,480
that we hope to get your contribution

823
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,480
i i will pause here let you

824
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,760
a few seconds to read it

825
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,040
i also provide my contact information

826
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,440
so we love to to hear from you

827
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,340
thank you very much

828
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,719
[Applause]

829
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,839
i think you don't usually get

830
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,119
a approach in ietf so i feel really

831
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,599
honored

832
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,240
any any questions comments

833
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,520
in the queue

834
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,160
whoever is the first so

835
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,000
rajiv do you want to speak

836
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,480
uh i hope you guys can hear me

837
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,599
so i have a question

838
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,560
um

839
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,920
you talked about uh there having been

840
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,079
some work done to measure the

841
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,320
performance improvements

842
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,480
um and that performance improvement for

843
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,760
ipv6 being larger than the performance

844
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,560
improvement for ipv4 when you

845
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,880
talk about uh dealing with keep edge or

846
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,839
deep in the network deployed content key

847
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,040
so i was just wondering if you have any

848
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,560
study or

849
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,880
reference material that i can look at

850
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
uh you know because that is an area of

851
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
great interest for me and the

852
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,800
organization that i work for

853
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,760
and uh we'd love to we're already kind

854
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,560
of

855
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,680
semi-dual stack but we deploy in a lot

856
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,359
of networks which are

857
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,880
till to this day

858
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,480
large uh you know consumer facing isps

859
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,359
that are ipv4 only so we'd love to be

860
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,520
able to show some statistics and you

861
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,680
know try to help move the needle with

862
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,599
these um you know medium mid-sized isps

863
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,079
who you know i have just not got onto

864
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,720
the ipv6 bandwagon yet

865
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,200
uh okay i i think the way should

866
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
probably you know take this discussion

867
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,880
offline because

868
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,359
uh it will it one is it will take a lot

869
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,520
of time and the second you know i cannot

870
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,760
remember you know all the

871
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,079
other you know the the the reference so

872
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,720
i can send you the reference afterwards

873
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,280
i i will definitely email you and we'll

874
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,960
we'll take this up

875
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,359
offline but then um you know it it this

876
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,160
is a very interesting data point to have

877
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,240
because we as service providers who are

878
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,599
going into these deep network locations

879
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,800
we would love to have some uh you know

880
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,280
ammunition so that when we go to these

881
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,000
providers who are reluctant to

882
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,280
you know

883
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,000
embrace ipv6 we have something that we

884
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
can show them and say it's in your

885
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,320
interest to do this even though uh you

886
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,160
know you don't mean you may not see a

887
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,000
pressing commercial need to do it right

888
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,480
now but hey here's a case for a

889
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,079
performance improvement for your

890
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,680
customers that should

891
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,520
you know help you make the decision to

892
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,000
go ahead and do this

893
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,839
okay thank you rajiv

894
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,640
uh

895
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,960
journaling over google as an enterprise

896
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,680
operator who spent some time operating

897
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,640
dual stack and v6 only network

898
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,400
i have an impression that in my

899
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,200
experience every single case when you

900
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,000
see v6 performance worse than before

901
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,079
is because of happy eyeballs

902
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,640
because v6 network is broken nobody

903
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,119
monitoring kid because of happy eyeballs

904
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,680
users are not complaining and it stays

905
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,400
like that until you turn off ipv4

906
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,960
so i'm quite sure it's not something in

907
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
the protocol not something in the

908
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,200
connectivity it's just bad operational

909
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,280
practices

910
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,000
okay yes i think that's that's kind of

911
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,440
what we are saying that you know the

912
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,839
machine itself is fine but you know if

913
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,040
you don't operate it correctly

914
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,240
then it has problems

915
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
hi this is barry lieber

916
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,359
can you go back to the slide where you

917
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,839
show the performance differences in

918
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,359
different regions

919
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,760
and i'm curious on that yeah the just

920
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,320
you just passed it now go back the other

921
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,760
way

922
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,599
next one

923
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,280
that one um

924
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,720
do you have any sense of why oceania is

925
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,440
so bad compared with the other regions

926
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,680
um

927
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,040
i

928
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,920
i don't okay because

929
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,680
i think that you know this is a slide

930
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,960
that i newly add and i today i went to

931
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,839
the the ap unique data and copy this i

932
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,000
think that this but i think that it's a

933
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,599
good question that we can probably

934
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,640
discuss together with jeff houston okay

935
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,879
thanks

936
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,839
hi mike ackerman first off i want to say

937
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,599
that you covered a lot of information

938
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,359
this is really good stuff i hope you'll

939
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,040
come back and do it again it's almost

940
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,760
inspirational thank you um

941
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,640
the

942
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,680
first question i want to ask maybe

943
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,119
somebody already did can we get copies

944
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,000
of your slides yes fantastic

945
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,680
uh and then i just wanted to ask one

946
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,359
specific question i got your email i got

947
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,320
a whole bunch more so beware um

948
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,480
you had a slide that said and it's right

949
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,320
up there it's uh

950
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,359
that ipv6 performs better in enterprises

951
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,200
i'm one of those can you is there a

952
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,040
short answer as to why or how

953
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,440
uh

954
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,200
we

955
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,118
see it in this uh

956
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,920
for example let me let me take facebook

957
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,680
as an example you know facebook

958
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,000
we provide here you know this

959
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,640
link to a youtube video

960
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,599
in this youtube video i believe that the

961
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,200
person's name is taught

962
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,960
well it's a

963
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,240
facebook person talking about

964
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,839
ipv6 his ipv6 performance is better than

965
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,240
it before i i remember using a nano

966
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
meeting or in some kind of meeting and

967
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,880
then there are people

968
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,040
from the audience

969
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,599
ask the same question that you just

970
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,359
asked yeah we want to know that those

971
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,240
people

972
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,480
i think that you know uh they provide

973
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,280
some kind of i i will not say that it's

974
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,760
it's a very direct answer they say well

975
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,400
for example if you do ipv6 then you have

976
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,680
no net

977
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,960
but really

978
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,160
nat

979
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,400
will introduce only a very small

980
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,440
difference

981
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,720
so ipv6 is better is it really because

982
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,480
of net or because of some other reasons

983
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,880
we didn't get a a very clear answer from

984
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,040
that uh youtube video i think we have

985
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,720
the reference okay yeah yeah

986
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,400
you can you can take a look

987
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
hoping there was some great generic

988
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,839
answer but it could be application or

989
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,599
situational specific and that that's

990
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,000
certainly understandable but yes we

991
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,839
actually we really i think like these

992
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,760
are the questions that we should dig

993
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,240
into and this is why we are doing this

994
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,880
and actually maybe maybe jane also you

995
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,680
know have some comments do you

996
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,839
google network do you feel that ipv6

997
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,400
performed better or you know if it

998
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,800
performs better why i definitely wrote

999
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,400
down what she just said that when you

1000
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,960
get to ipv6 only and that makes a lot of

1001
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,640
sense you can see where the economies of

1002
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,560
scale will start to add up and give you

1003
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,839
better performance maybe even

1004
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,760
holistically so

1005
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,200
i'm just looking for any answers

1006
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,720
anywhere i can get it and this was great

1007
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,000
thank you again

1008
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,240
thank you

1009
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,280
so we are already

1010
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,960
5 30

1011
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,760
and if there are no more questions i

1012
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,640
really want to

1013
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,800
what did you have another question

1014
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,960
very quick question

1015
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,680
if it's not too late

1016
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,280
yeah so this is again relating to the

1017
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,760
difference um so while

1018
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,920
in this table you're kind of showing the

1019
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,319
average uh difference in the rtts uh and

1020
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,280
and yes based on these numbers uh looks

1021
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,839
like it's a massive outlier with a much

1022
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,760
larger average but uh i probably am not

1023
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
as surprised by that because it's quite

1024
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,800
likely

1025
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,480
that the

1026
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,599
overall total rtt average for

1027
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,839
connections in oceania are probably

1028
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,480
going to be a whole lot higher because

1029
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,680
of the fact that it has very limited uh

1030
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,079
capabilities of serving traffic locally

1031
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,240
and most traffic originating from there

1032
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,800
is reaching out to some other region of

1033
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,839
the world

1034
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,520
in order to get served which is not the

1035
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,960
case with maybe uh america's uh or

1036
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,800
europe or for that matter even asia

1037
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,720
because a lot of that traffic will be

1038
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,400
within the region

1039
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,720
okay so a lot of asia is going to be

1040
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,400
served out of china or india or

1041
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
singapore and you know doesn't really

1042
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,560
have to go outside the region so when

1043
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,760
the total

1044
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,960
uh

1045
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,040
connection rtts are

1046
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,440
in the range of 40 or 50 milliseconds

1047
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,760
their 10 percent difference turns out to

1048
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,480
be 4 milliseconds perfect with oceania

1049
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,480
if they're if the average of their

1050
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,640
connections are mostly going

1051
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,760
to be in the 300 and 400 millisecond rtt

1052
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,680
rate because they're all going outside

1053
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,040
of the oceania region to get served a 10

1054
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
differential in performance would still

1055
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,960
look like a very big difference over

1056
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,839
here so i'm my question is have you

1057
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,319
looked at that as a data point

1058
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,720
while doing this analysis

1059
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,839
uh

1060
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,960
the the answer is no as i said you know

1061
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,440
this slide i added today you know upon

1062
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,800
the request of a colleague but i i can

1063
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,319
offer uh

1064
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,280
uh observation is that you know if you

1065
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,079
know jeff houston how he how he collects

1066
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,880
his statistics he's basically partnering

1067
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,880
with google and you know

1068
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,920
uh

1069
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,640
uh

1070
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,200
putting a kind of like an ad on the you

1071
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,680
know chrome browser and then this chrome

1072
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,800
browser will contact his you know he's

1073
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,000
he's a prober let's say and then um

1074
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,240
because this is sinkholding this is

1075
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
stinkling so i

1076
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,040
do the the observation that you know

1077
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,240
at different time these can you know for

1078
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,960
example tomorrow if you go to you know

1079
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,040
jeff houston's side and then take

1080
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,599
another snapshot the number can be quite

1081
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:24,640
different

1082
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,560
so i think that this is this is point

1083
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,119
number one this you cannot definitely

1084
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,680
not uh you know draw a conclusion that

1085
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,880
you know oceania is always is always bad

1086
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,280
so again you know all of these you know

1087
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,079
uh

1088
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,160
every statistics you must also look at

1089
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,520
you know kind of like take it with a

1090
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,480
grain of salt with a grain of salt you

1091
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,200
know

1092
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,839
really tomorrow we when we look at the

1093
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,000
the one and just now when you talk about

1094
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,040
the

1095
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,599
the maybe you know osuni is far away

1096
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,240
from content but again we are here we

1097
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,839
are talking about the difference between

1098
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,440
ipv4 and ipv6 and the long distance you

1099
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,040
know is a burden for both ipv4 and ipv6

1100
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,280
so arguably you know it shouldn't create

1101
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,680
a lot of difference but other than that

1102
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,920
really i'm sorry you know

1103
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,880
i

1104
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,880
i i really feel that that for ipv6

1105
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,160
performance

1106
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,440
uh

1107
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
there are

1108
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,079
a lot of analysis is worth doing because

1109
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,640
we really you know know i would say that

1110
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,520
we know very little um if we we just

1111
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,560
support ipv6 and we don't face these

1112
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,800
challenges

1113
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,280
they will not just go away so i think

1114
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,000
this is why you know i i like to do this

1115
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,760
talk and kind of like expose these

1116
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,160
challenges and so that you know we can

1117
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,598
you know do something together

1118
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,560
thank you that was very informative

1119
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,799
well

1120
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,400
let me thank all of you very much for

1121
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,839
spending the afternoon with us i really

1122
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,079
appreciate it and you got my contact

1123
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,839
information

1124
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,480
we really love to to hear from you

1125
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,760
so

1126
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,400
again bye now

1127
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,799
thank you so much

1128
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,200
you
