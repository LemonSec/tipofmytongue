as we are at the ietf we are governed by

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,000
certain um

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,799
processes and policies that are covered

24
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,280
um through our note uh

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,479
through various bcps rfcs

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,799
and if you're unfamiliar with them we

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,240
suggest you go

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,920
look them up

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,799
but it governs all contributions made in

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,360
the ietf whether it's in this meeting

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,680
on the list in a document or even

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
hallway conversations

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,520
similarly we have

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,439
um a code of conduct that uh

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,520
there are guidelines

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,400
that basically say we should always

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,240
treat each other professionally and

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
treat each other with courtesy and

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
respect

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,320
um

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,200
so we are hybrid there is a

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,360
on-site tool

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,520
it allows you to advance the slides as

44
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,679
well as enter the queue

45
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,760
if you

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
use that that would be most helpful

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,200
if you don't luis will ask you to help

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
manage the uh

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,879
the balance between the online and the

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,040
in in-room queue

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,560
and

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
i think people are pretty good about

53
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
working on online nowadays since we've

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,520
been doing it so long

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,680
we're using

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
meat echo for the cupid we've talked

57
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,080
about that but we're also using it for

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
blue sheets

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,440

and

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,040
for uh note taking we're using

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,120
our usual

65
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,239

66

and that is on thursday

79
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,159
oh well we have a pretty packed agenda

80
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,440
so we're going to try to keep to the

81
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,840
schedule

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,280
there's been a couple of updates

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
including who is presenting

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,840
um you know what's really interesting uh

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,400
janos i just uploaded a version but this

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,879
is the old version so somehow uh meat

87
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,640
echo uh

88
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,599
didn't pick up the latest version so the

89
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,120
um if you go to the uh um our

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,239
uh

91
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,439
the

92
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,599
either any of the online agendas you'll

93
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,000
see that's uh scott mansfield is going

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
to be presenting on the second slot and

95
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,480
also we corrected the name there's one

96
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,320
other correction that's not shown on the

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,560
slides that is going to be come up in a

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,759
minute and i'll talk to that

99
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
um

100
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,840
this slide is complete uh i don't know

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,840
what happened to this it's um

102
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,800
complete garbage

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
let's see if

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
all

105
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,639
that's so strange

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,360
so i believe this was um

107
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
status and talking about documents that

108
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,120
are moving through

109
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,919
i'll have to pull that up separately and

110
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,039
remember what else is here

111
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,680
the

112
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
this is just a reminder about

113
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600
our disclosure process that we stop and

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
start before each

115
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
step in our process and do polls and

116
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,280
those polls gate moving forward

117
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,960
and

118
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
we're all familiar with working online

119
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
now but we want this is just a reminder

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,000
that we can host virtual interims if uh

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
participants would like all that takes

122
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,919
is a message to the chairs and we can

123
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,639
set something up

124
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,360
okay charter update this is a really uh

125
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,120
important conversation

126
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
we've been talking for a number of

127
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,440
meetings about

128
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,960
bringing in

129
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,400
potentially new traffic treatments

130
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,680
including and notably queuing on list

131
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,319
we've also um someone raised the point

132
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
about uh

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,400
we want to allow for scheduling we agree

134
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,560
that there are different types of of

135
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
traffic treatments

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,479
our suggestion to address the the list

137
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,240
comment which is not reflected here but

138
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,000
is on the online version

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
is um to add a

140
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,440
uh the clause for example

141
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,759
um between the word including and

142
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,400
forwarding and

143
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,440
so that this list is not prescriptive

144
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,319
and

145
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,000
so to allow for um

146
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,440
any other um

147
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,479
changes in treatment

148
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,160
um

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,039
uh

150
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,280
the

151
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,319
do we have our a.d

152
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,479
in the room

153
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,240

155
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
hi john

156
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,240
um

157
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
oh for some reason i thought you were

158
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,199
going to be in person maybe i just was

159
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,360
confused or you changed your plans i

160
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,039
changed my plan yeah sorry i thought i

161
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,560
had told you

162
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
i'm sure you did and i just missed it um

163
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,680
uh

164
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,039
and by the way i was right there with

165
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,400
you because i was originally planning to

166
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,599
go also

167
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,520
um so um

168
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,840
what we want to do is add the words for

169
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,000
example here between including and

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,400
forwarding and we just want to make sure

171
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,440
you don't have any objection to that

172
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,280
uh no objection at all

173
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,520
great i think it's it's it anyway but it

174
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,840
makes it clear i think that's just fine

175
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,599
yeah and the comment on the list and

176
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,880
you'll see that this is already on the

177
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,960
list that the someone was saying that

178
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,400
they want to talk about scheduling

179
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,039
versus queuing and and and there's a

180
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,120
fairly fine

181
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,039
dif difference there that i think most

182
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,120
people would miss and rather than

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,520
getting into that exhaustive list we

184
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,840
thought that making it exactly an

185
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,639
example would uh uh would be the best

186
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,639
way to address it so glad to hear you do

187
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,960
not have any objections we do have

188
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,000
someone in queue

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
robin

190
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,120
hello

191
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,639
can you hear me

192
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,080
yeah you're a little low but i i can

193
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,759
hear you okay

194
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,039
okay i'll try okay in fact i have a

195
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,240
doubt because i know that the tsn and

196
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,199
the dead knight may share in this the

197
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,000
someday secure mechanism

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
i'm not sure this

199
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,960
if we do this work in the that night so

200
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,360
i'm not sure if this work will

201
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,199
synchronize with the ieee and the tsa or

202
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,440
not

203
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,679
yeah um

204
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,958
so

205
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,440
i i the way i view it is that it would

206
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
be a alternate queuing mechanism we

207
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,399
always can use different subnet layer

208
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,920
technologies that bring in their own

209
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,880
queuing

210
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,279
um i i think

211
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,480
in there's the sort of in theory and in

212
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,440
practice

213
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
um

214
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,440
in

215
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,320
uh

216
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,920
in theory

217
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,800
we want to coordinate with other sdos

218
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
and the technologies that they're

219
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,000
defining and make sure that we're

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,920
compatible with them in practice we need

221
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,560
to look at the specifics of a proposal

222
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,720
in order to

223
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,200
address the specific question

224
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
in terms of working with tsn we see

225
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
nothing changing in terms of how we work

226
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,080
with dsm

227
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
okay okay

228
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,959
sure

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,839
uh any other questions comments

230
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
all right well thank you on on this

231
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,959
point and uh john i believe is going to

232
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
bring us to the iesg immediately

233
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,560
following this meeting and then we'll

234
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,839
run that process

235
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
and uh for the last slide

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,800
a and a good thing we're running ahead

237
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
is we've updated our milestones based on

238
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
where we stand in the working group we

239
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,320
haven't updated them in quite some time

240
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,640
so we thought it was good to do that

241
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,760
some of the

242
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,480
changes are pretty obvious

243
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,920
related to

244
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
oam

245
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,320
and our existing control plane work the

246
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,800
uh some are related to what we've just

247
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
been talking about in terms of expanding

248
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,079
the scope

249
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,480
and we've talked about rather than uh

250
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,640
call it out as queuing or scheduling we

251
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,959
just talk about data plate enhancements

252
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,120
and we've put in some straw man dates

253
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,920
here

254
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,519
for when we start um

255
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,279
adopting documents and um submitting to

256
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,880
the isg keeping in mind that we are

257
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
always contribution driven

258
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,880
so that uh you know in order to make

259
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
these dates we really need contributions

260
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
from the working group

261
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
um

262
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
the

263
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,160
requirements date we chose because we

264
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,440
think we have a a a reasonable document

265
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,839
um or

266
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,839
i shouldn't say reasonable a more

267
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,600
consolidated document based on the

268
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
discussions that we've had

269
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,680
and so we think we suspect we're pretty

270
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,880
close there we're going to be talking

271
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,720
about that today

272
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,279
we left a little more time on

273
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,160
the

274
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,040
um it solutions because we feel that in

275
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,519
changing the charter today we want to

276
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,920
give some time for different solution

277
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,480
documents to be um submitted and

278
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
to come into the working group and then

279
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,680
be discussed

280
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
so we wanted to give a little more time

281
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
on the solutions than on

282
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,680
the requirements document

283
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,440
um

284
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,200
and i think that's those are all the

285
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
points we wanted to um

286
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,800
we wanted to cover

287
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,920
uh ben

288
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,519
hi uh thank you thank you

289
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,040
uh i i

290
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,079
uh on this page i have two questions the

291
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,160
first one is i see the the for the ipo

292
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,600
document is actually it's updated and is

293
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,200
based on the mps oam document so um i'm

294
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
not sure that why and this this document

295
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,519
is first submitted between a bit before

296
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,360
the other oem documents or is there any

297
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,440
uh solution is not

298
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,800
not quite

299
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,279
decided to be the one

300
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,320
should be

301
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,760
submitted and the second one uh is the

302
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
clarification question um because we are

303
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,079
not quite yet sure about the enhanced

304
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,959
uh what what it has to mean in the

305
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,560
in the force to

306
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,839
to yeah from the four to two from the

307
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,920
fourth to the last um

308
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,519
um lines about these uh about the the

309
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,920
enhanced uh that uh then that data

310
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
playing requirements

311
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,639
so uh i'd like to first

312
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,920
have the discussion on these two um

313
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
understood

314
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
points and then

315
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,120
uh if it is possible and then submit it

316
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,040
to iesgb4

317
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,519
before we have the consensus on this

318
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,399
list

319
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,000
thank you

320
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
okay on the first point it's pretty easy

321
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,279
i believe that should have just said

322
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,040
first the oam document so that's a good

323
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
catch we were not trying to be specific

324
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
as to which which it was

325
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,880
uh so i think that's a simple mistake

326
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,839
um

327
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,720
certainly a necessary correction um

328
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,120
i did not quite follow

329
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,240
your

330
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,040
question or comment on the last four i

331
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
don't yanosh did you catch it do you

332
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,279
want to respond or do should we ask

333
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,839
the statement

334
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,000
maybe i can repeat my question the

335
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,560
question is i don't quite uh

336
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,959
follow the mailing of the enhanced

337
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,000
yeah that

338
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,760
specification of this uh this word

339
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,000
so we've been having discussions about

340
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,839
large scale requirements and then some

341
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,600
proposed queuing mechanisms those have

342
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,120
been going on for a little while in the

343
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
working group and we kept coming back to

344
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,480
a question of whether or not

345
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,800
uh changing um

346
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
defining queuing

347
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,160
uh belonged in this working group or a

348
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,480
different working group and um

349
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,519
and we've um in discussions with our id

350
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,760
aad with the transport area there was

351
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
agreement that this was something we

352
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
could do inside the routing area and

353
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,680
inside our working group

354
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
and so the require we have a

355
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,320
requirements uh need to define what

356
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,199
we're going to do that's the

357
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,040
requirements and then we

358
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,199
have room for defining one or more

359
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,199
solutions and that's the solution

360
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,320
document so that's what's meant here by

361
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,199
enhanced data plane now if there's other

362
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,160
enhancements that are needed

363
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,480
that's also uh within our um

364
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,120
within our charter um some of those have

365
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
been clearly youth in the charter others

366
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
have been sort of implicitly

367
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
and

368
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
rather than be specific at our

369
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,199
milestones we are

370
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,199
using we're using the class that the

371
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,480
term enhanced

372
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,000
net data plane

373
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,839
does that help

374
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,639
yeah thank you uh much clearer thank you

375
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,000
okay great

376
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,279
and as i mentioned we're going to be

377
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,680
talking about the requirements document

378
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,600
on the event it's on the agenda and

379
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
there's one solution document also on

380
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,959
the agenda

381
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,279
uh kwon

382
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
do you want to say something you're

383
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,079
muted

384
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,880
uh maybe we'll move to torlas

385
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,839
um thank you

386
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,639
so

387
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,880
that that looks to me as if there would

388
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
be only

389
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,800
one document for each of these areas is

390
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,120
that kind of because i don't think we

391
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
necessarily did the same thing right

392
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,079
with different

393
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,720
ip and mpls data plane documents so

394
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,680
can can you try to clarify that for me

395
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,399
um we certainly expect one requirements

396
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,399
document

397
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,639
for a solution this says first

398
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,800
solution it doesn't say last solution it

399
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
doesn't say only solution

400
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,480
right well because yeah i mean we can

401
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
see if

402
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
if if one requirement document

403
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,759
makes sense or if that

404
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,920
would also be multiple by mean of you

405
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,199
know

406
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,079
different type of

407
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,240
type of networks or use case

408
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,279
requirements right so i mean one one is

409
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,799
always good but i'm not sure if if

410
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,760
that's the the only way to do it okay

411
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,439
uh if we

412
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,520
um get you know as i said earlier we're

413
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,199
contribution driven

414
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,400
so if we have documents that look like

415
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,359
they don't make sense to be merged then

416
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,400
certainly

417
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,799
we can do more than one

418
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,079
at this time we're not seeing that

419
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,959
so

420
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
we do have a requirements document on

421
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,240
the

422
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,360
agenda if you think that there are other

423
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,320
use cases that are needed um or not

424
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,720
covered perhaps bring it up then

425
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,039
um and because then we can have it in

426
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,120
the context of that specific document

427
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
and you know talking specifics is always

428
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
better than talking abstract no no i

429
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,039
mean the the requirement document that

430
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,360
i'm on i understand what it's good for

431
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,080
and that we need it i wouldn't claim

432
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,919
that it necessarily covers all the

433
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,679
possible areas where that net might be

434
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,039
of interest so

435
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,919
that's uh why why i think for the

436
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,440
requirements there might be multiple

437
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,520
ones and i think also as a general note

438
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,039
right this is a mature working group

439
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,600
it's incremental work and so then the

440
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,679
question whether we do this type of

441
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,200
shall i say

442
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,520
three gpp style system level documents

443
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,120
as opposed to individual technical

444
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,439
contributions is then a process question

445
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,200
okay thank you

446
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,080
all right do we have uh

447
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,000
any other comments questions on this

448
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
if not we're going to move on

449
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,000
and maybe

450
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,320
maybe if you don't mind just there was

451
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,919
that broken slide

452
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,640
just

453
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,039
in one sentence we have two documents

454
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,760
for which publication requested

455
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,440
you can check it

456
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,240
and there is a newly adopted document

457
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,400
the defeat of by mpls over udpip

458
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,200
and the oem framework document is not on

459
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,720
agenda but you will hear the details

460
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,160
and sorry about this library

461
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,919
all right thank you for that um scott i

462
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,799
have loaded you up

463
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,080
if you want to present your screen you

464
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,960
need to select request

465
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,280
um

466
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,120
yeah there you go

467
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,360
right thank you

468
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,160
so

469
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,840
is

470
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,440
it i'm clicking grant screen and it's

471
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,559
not giving to you maybe i have to

472
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,640
are you sharing or am i

473
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,880
uh well i was

474
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,280
i have a screen request

475
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,880
you have to you have to stop sharing the

476
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,480
screen first i think

477
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,160
if you are

478
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
i'm not

479
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,440
someone is

480
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
somebody is i don't have control

481
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
oh because that's not what i'm sharing

482
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,158
so let's just

483
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480

484
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,039
i will cancel my request and just

485
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,400
use this and what i will do

486
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,000
well what i will do is i am pasting into

487
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,480
the chat window all of the links that i

488
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,600
were going to talk about anyway so first

489
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,720
off

490
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,200
thanks everyone this is scott mansfield

491
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
i'm representing

492
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,240
um erickson normally in this capacity i

493
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,480
am the ietf's itu-t liaison coordinator

494
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,480
so i said it in the middle between

495
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,960
communications that go between the ietf

496
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,000
and the itu-t and in this case one thing

497
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,159
if you check the chat window

498
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,080
i wanted to point out that there has

499
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,039
been some liaison activity going on it's

500
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,760
also what's seen in the agenda

501
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,520
we received a liaison from the itu-t

502
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,960
question 6 in study group 13 back in

503
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
july of last year

504
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,640
we considered it and replied to it in

505
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,159
i don't know november or something you

506
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,480
can check the check the liaison

507
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,400
and then

508
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,159
the uh so i've been having some

509
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,960
conversations with the rapper tours of

510
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,320
q6

511
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,679
and there was just a q6

512
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,280
meeting

513
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,440
last week or two

514
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,039
and so the uh chair the rapid tour is if

515
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,360
you i go flip to the next slot oh i can

516
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
flip to the next slide i don't need to

517
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,200
tell you that

518
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,039
um the rapid tours uh graciously created

519
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,080
a

520
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,880
short slide deck that provides the

521
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
status of what it is that that q613 has

522
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,320
been working on

523
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,559
and a pointer to how to participate and

524
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,200
when their next meetings are so i know i

525
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,600
have like eight minutes left so i'm not

526
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
going to get into the details of these

527
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,200
slides i

528
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,080
wanted to provide a

529
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,400
just a snapshot of where the q6 work now

530
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,919
has landed

531
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,799
post the liaison responses that we've

532
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,320
had if there's more that the ietf wants

533
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,720
to say you know let me know and i can

534
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,080
say it back if there's more that q6 13

535
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,880
wants to say to the ietf

536
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,080
i also attend those meetings and we can

537
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,039
discuss it from that angle as well so

538
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,960
the uh

539
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,600
the two uh rapid tours uh tasting from

540
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
uh etri is the one that put these slides

541
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,159
together i really appreciate the uh the

542
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,240
effort that he's put into this to

543
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,120
provide a nice communication mechanism

544
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,440
for those that don't know the work i'm

545
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
not reading this whole slide the thing

546
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,960
that you need to understand is what is

547
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,000
uh

548
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,280
study group 13 the itu-t is arranged in

549
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,720
study group study group 13 is the one on

550
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,559
next generation

551
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,679
work

552
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,360
and q6 in particular is

553
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,840
about uh qos

554
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,080
so quality of service and quality of

555
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,440
experience related to

556
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,679
networks resource control

557
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,280
large-scale networks even how qos and

558
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,000
qoe are going to be applied to uh

559
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,640
quantum key distribution networks so

560
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,880
this is kind of the space that they're

561
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,080
in i put in the chat i put a pointer to

562
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,520
the full

563
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,919
terms of reference and a summary of what

564
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,679
q6 is doing for those that are

565
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,440
interested

566
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,600
the

567
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,240
the one of the fundamental documents

568
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,480
that's driving the work moving forward

569
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,919
in question six the itu-t just had a

570
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,640
major reorganization or a major meeting

571
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,720
that sets the plan for the next two

572
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,120
years

573
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,440
so without going into too much detail

574
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,520
there i wanted to provide some

575
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,760
information about what

576
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,240
what we see the itu-t

577
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,679
and in this regard question uh six of

578
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,640
study group 13 is going to be working on

579
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,440
and they created a

580
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
supplement to the

581
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,559
itu recommendation series and a

582
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,559
supplement is an informational document

583
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,039
so this is work that was completed as

584
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,440
part of a study basically in in terms

585
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,480
that

586
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,279
most would understand it was a study and

587
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,080
a report has been created and this is a

588
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,120
supplement providing the information

589
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,679
particular to compact capabilities and

590
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,520
performance related to applications that

591
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,919
the study group 13 thinks will be

592
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,960
important in the year 2030 so

593
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,799
this provides some

594
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,360
details on how they're looking at terms

595
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,000
like uh later and later

596
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,039
latency and uh jitter i had too much

597
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,159
caffeine my jitter is too high right now

598
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,679
so the

599
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,159
uh so that's the basic so and i put a

600
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,159
pointer to that document as well in the

601
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,480
chat window if you wanted to see that

602
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,919
and then so

603
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,799
some of the buzzwords here that need

604
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,440
that you need to understand so that we

605
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,360
understand where the dividing line

606
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,360
between itu-t and ietf work lies

607
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,640
is

608
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,240
the itu-t it likes to use the term

609
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,960
large-scale networks entered into domain

610
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,080
networks and so looking at

611
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,640
use cases frameworks and architectures

612
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,000
that support

613
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,039
uh latency time synchronization with or

614
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,720
without time synchronization in

615
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
large-scale networks so they're looking

616
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,159
at it from the top down

617
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,159
where you know the ietf well i don't

618
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,840
have to tell you what the ietf looks at

619
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,279
everybody in this room knows what the

620
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,440
ietf looks at it and how it looks at it

621
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,320
from the bottom up

622
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,799
so this is a document that i did not

623
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,559
provide a pointer to but it's easy to

624
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,799
find the the numbers there and it's a

625
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,799
published document that provides some

626
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,679
more of the terminology that's the basis

627
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,480
of what's going on so

628
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,960
they talk about um

629
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,440
without time so yeah just just more like

630
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,120
i say i'm not going into the technical

631
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
detail i only have a couple minutes i

632
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,520
wanted to provide this so that if you

633
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,640
have questions about the the terminology

634
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,720
used how the documents are progressed

635
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,440
what documents are that are the most uh

636
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,799
relevant

637
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,520
and um the most current then you can

638
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,480
contact me or tasing and we can uh open

639
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
a conversation

640
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,679
so uh

641
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,880
documents that you see in this uh format

642
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,360
so if it's like a y dot a number that's

643
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,279
kind of like an rfc

644
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,919
if it's y dot something like this

645
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,600
this is work in progress and so there is

646
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,159
now documents related to functional

647
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,520
architecture breakdown related to the

648
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,760
terminology uh talked about in

649
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,720
y.3113

650
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,880
and so this document and this is one of

651
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,360
the documents i believe we received and

652
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,159
have sent comments back

653
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,440
and then there is uh lsn large-scale

654
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,559
networks

655
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,120
and this is a jitter guarantee

656
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,840
so this is a document about

657
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,679
well i mean i need to

658
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,000
re-say what it says so it talks about

659
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,559
the the math and the uh gives the

660
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,720
information and definitions on on how

661
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,880
they're talking about buffering

662
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,200
in um in this document

663
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,919
related to how you deal with it across a

664
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,240
large scale network

665
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,760
and then there's qos so you'll notice

666
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
requirements and frameworks so a lot of

667
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,919
requirements frameworks use cases

668
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,240
architectures those are the things that

669
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,720
are being discussed in in this

670
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,159
in this group

671
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,720
and then so um here's another document

672
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,760
that's qos um uh requirements on

673
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,640
large-scale telecommunication networks

674
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,559
uh this is a key word well you can't

675
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,919
highlight so uh imt 2020 networks and

676
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,720
beyond is the terminology that the itu-t

677
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,000
is using until the itu-r comes up with

678
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
what they're going to call

679
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,440
5g

680
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,320
or you know beyond 5g so this is that's

681
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,120
what that means

682
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,480
and then

683
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,440
uh so uh so yet another picture that

684
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
shows the uh general view of the

685
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
deterministic network so the large-scale

686
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,760
deterministic network framework and

687
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,279
provides some pointers to the

688
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,520
terminology that's being used user side

689
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,640
network site and multi-domain

690
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
so one of the things that i've found

691
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,120
being a liaison officer for as long as i

692
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,960
have is that it's it's important for

693
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,880
both organizations to understand the

694
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,799
terminology that they're using to make

695
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,039
sure that they're talking about the same

696
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,080
things and then so this is an example of

697
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,000
a use case document that's talking about

698
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,480
particular industrial ethernet use cases

699
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
and and how

700
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,200
and how the

701
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,039
work will move forward so

702
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,679
and this is yet another detail but

703
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,320
another dive deeper into the document

704
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,960
that describes the figures a little more

705
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,279
and provides pointers to the

706
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,440
information about how the

707
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,720
problem has been decomposed

708
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,679
and then so uh this is a slide that will

709
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,159
obviously take a lot this there's a lot

710
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,840
packed into this slide and this is

711
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,799
something that i encourage the

712
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,919
people on both the the ietf people and

713
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,399
also the the itu-t people that are

714
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,880
working on these documents to look at

715
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,159
the entire

716
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,279
space the entire

717
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,760
standards area that's working on

718
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,080
problems related to deterministic

719
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,640
network uh networking

720
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,559
quality of service

721
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,840
and this is a local area so local area

722
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,159
network so this one is directly related

723
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,720
to things that would happen that that

724
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,799
net would care about and also the ieee

725
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,480
802.1 tsn group so looking for where are

726
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,720
their gaps are there gaps in protocol is

727
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,760
it just a way of looking at it is it a

728
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,080
use case problem is it a framework

729
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,760
architecture problem

730
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,480
and so i encourage people to to look at

731
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,000
these to make sure that the right

732
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,640
questions are being asked

733
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,120
and then the last slide and i'm looking

734
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,760
at the elapsed time and i'm i'm still on

735
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,960
time so good so there are meetings these

736
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,679
are meetings that if you want to come

737
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,360
you don't have to be a member of the

738
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,520
itu-t to come to these if you're an

739
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,200
invited expert

740
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,919
so

741
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,399
you can contact me contact the chairs

742
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,799
contact the itu-t

743
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,640
what's called the tsb that's their

744
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,039
steering group if you're interested in

745
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,919
participating in in these we can find a

746
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,159
way to get you an account so that you

747
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,480
can log into these meetings and

748
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,039
and provide your opinion another way is

749
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,320
contact me for a liaison so

750
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,720
i will leave it there open for i see no

751
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,360
one in the queue but i will stop talking

752
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,519
now and let

753
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,840
the chairs do their job here thank you

754
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,000
very much for your time and i appreciate

755
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,720
the

756
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,000
time thanks

757
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,320
scott

758
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,799
magically i now have ability to share

759
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,960
again so whatever you did give you back

760
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,760
control thank you

761
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,600
okay

762
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,360
we are moving on uh shusang

763
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,480
can't hear me well well

764
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,440
yes and hopefully you have the buttons

765
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,399
across the bottom

766
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,840
uh

767
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,880
yes uh but could you help me to

768
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,080
present the slide if it

769
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,440
is

770
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,679
uh sure hold on one moment

771
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,600
i'll

772
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,799
maybe take control back

773
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,239
i can see the slide

774
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,159
you want me to advance for you is that

775
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,240
correct

776
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,600
uh yes

777
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,039
please thank you

778
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,200
sure

779
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,399
thank you

780
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,799
uh hi this is jose and i will give a

781
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,960
brief introduction about the status of

782
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,760
the nether controller plan framework

783
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,240
presenting other others next slide

784
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
please uh

785
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,959
i see slide 2

786
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,440
yes

787
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,799
that's it

788
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,440
this slide provides the background and

789
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,360
purpose of this document

790
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,360
uh this document then add controller

791
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
plan is first uh

792
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,240
the

793
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,440
is uh the the concept of data controller

794
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,159
plan is first firstly define the erc

795
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:42,240
8655 which is the combination of control

796
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,320
plan management plan and in a data plan

797
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,080
framework document

798
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,640
there are also some introductions about

799
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,200
the requirements and specifications for

800
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,840
the net controller plan and also in

801
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,399
different data data plan documents

802
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,559
there are some

803
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,960
controller plan requirements for example

804
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,760
for the mps data plan documents it

805
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,600
mentions that there are some

806
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,280
requirements for label distribution and

807
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,399
label management in controller plan and

808
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,800
this document is intended to give a

809
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,839
clear framework for the whole picture of

810
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,079
then at the controller plan which could

811
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,560
compile all the net controller plan

812
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,280
requirements in one place and also give

813
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,639
an overview of control architecture

814
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,359
which hopefully could give guidance for

815
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,679
the following work about the control

816
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,119
plan and management plan

817
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,079
next slide please

818
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,760
here is the overview of what have been

819
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,480
defined in this document

820
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,639
in section one we we have an

821
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,199
introduction and in section two

822
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,720
uh we listed the primary requirements

823
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,880
for dynamic controller plan

824
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,160
which align with the the definition of

825
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,359
rfc

826
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,599
8938

827
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,000
uh section three and section four are

828
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,640
both about then and the control plan uh

829
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,760
in the nf3 there are three types of data

830
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,000
control plan architecture

831
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,560
the first one is a fully distributed

832
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,000
control plan

833
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,200
using dynamic signaling protocols

834
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,400
and the second is fully centralized sdn

835
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,599
like

836
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,240
control plan and we also define a habit

837
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,640
control plan which contains both

838
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,200
distributed protocols and centralized

839
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,040
controlling

840
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,560
in section four

841
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,920
then at control plan considerations are

842
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,400
specified in detail

843
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,040
respectively for different decnet

844
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,119
mechanisms that have already been

845
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,599
defined in den and architecture

846
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,880
including

847
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,480
explicit paths

848
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,800
resource reservation and

849
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,040
pruf support

850
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,839
also different data plan solutions are

851
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,839
considered for example

852
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,920
nps ip and also segment routing

853
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,119
in section 5 it is still

854
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,800
very brave

855
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,200
it gives a management plan overview

856
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,359
which mainly includes some brief

857
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,560
introduction

858
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,520
about

859
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,640
static provisioning for example yamado

860
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,800
and also some brief introduction about

861
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,839
data that net oem

862
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,280
next slide please

863
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,400
ah pascal is in cube do you want to ask

864
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,000
now or after the presentation pascal

865
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,240
i'm okay

866
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,440
can you hear me okay

867
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,520
yes yes i can hear you

868
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,000
yes it's it's about the controller plane

869
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,920
and control plane or

870
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,720
for that mechanisms

871
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,640
at fro we are

872
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,400
defining

873
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,280
uh

874
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,599
functions in the architecture which

875
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,000
which require some control of plane

876
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
activity and there was this discussion

877
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,119
whether

878
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,040
um this should be part of the raw

879
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,920
architecture or not and and a strong

880
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,839
uh tendency to think just like the

881
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,920
bat-net architecture that this belongs

882
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,079
to the controller plane and not to the

883
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,040
row or the deadman architecture and so

884
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,400
my question is like

885
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
would you like to include some raw

886
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,800
consideration as part of the death net

887
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
architecture control plate architecture

888
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,599
or should we also have a role control of

889
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,520
plane architecture

890
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,480
actually in my mind i mean if you could

891
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,400
put some raw configuration there we

892
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,200
would be understand

893
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,760
i think in the architecture document the

894
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,599
the

895
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:50,160
specifications for these functions are

896
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,720
not so detailed especially

897
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,960
in the aspect of controller plan and

898
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,079
this document may provide some

899
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,560
explanations and a more detailed

900
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
understanding about what could be done

901
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,680
in controller plan for these functions

902
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,839
so it i think it can be um

903
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,119
a detailed version of the explanation if

904
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,400
i understand this right but if um

905
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,200
working group have some other

906
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,759
yes please

907
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,920
yeah i think pascal if you have

908
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,400
something specific you'd like to propose

909
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,680
uh

910
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,890
do so um and then we can

911
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,119
[Music]

912
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,040
judge if it belongs in this document or

913
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,920
a raw specific document oh okay so i

914
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,760
i'll i'll post something on the mailing

915
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,880
list then

916
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,800
and and you lou you you know exactly

917
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
what i'm talking about right it's it's

918
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,480
all this actually i don't know i mean i

919
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,240
know what's in the raw document i'm not

920
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,000
sure exactly what you're thinking here

921
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,920
so you know having having that

922
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,839
proposed words would be really helpful

923
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,119
uh thank you okay carlos thank you

924
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,560
yeah this is kind of generous you see

925
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,800
three i just wanted to echo what pascal

926
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,480
said i think that is

927
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,240
very relevant to have that kind of

928
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,800
consideration i don't really care where

929
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
but i i think it will be important to

930
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,839
agree

931
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,920
where this work may be

932
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,839
or who it's gonna take that work either

933
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,920
that net or i mean with a specific

934
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,480
document but i think that that is a very

935
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,400
useful piece of information that we need

936
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,359
to add

937
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,680
thanks

938
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,760
oh yes just

939
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,079
oh sorry

940
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,599
now it was too early please respond

941
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,240
carlos can you go ahead we can't hear

942
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,480
you if you're speaking no sorry i i

943
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,320
think there was a collision i was a i

944
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,160
was getting too fast to the mic i think

945
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,440
she wanted to

946
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,320
to respond first

947
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,640
oh it's okay just uh

948
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,200
just as lou has mentioned it will be

949
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,280
very helpful if you could put the

950
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,160
contribution or detailed

951
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,320
suggestion in the mailing list and

952
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,720
i think this document if it is possible

953
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,800
we could include these

954
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,079
different

955
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,880
mechanisms considerations

956
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,760
right um tallest eckerd future way um

957
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,440
i think in bangkok there was a a quick

958
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,079
overview also about some of the tsn

959
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,400
protocols for their controller plane

960
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,160
which i forgot the name of because

961
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,960
they're always crazy names um but that

962
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,359
that that is a i think a very nice

963
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,680
hybrid uh one that allows you to put the

964
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
central controller in or not

965
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,520
um and it makes it much more flexible so

966
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,960
i think would be great to add a

967
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,400
reference to that i think some of the

968
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,319
co-authors should be aware of that i

969
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,480
didn't see that in in in the list of

970
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,920
reference technologies thanks

971
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,560
uh you mean qcc

972
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,480
the ieee our document

973
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,880
yeah the the actual ieee document i was

974
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,720
browsing through the references and i i

975
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,040
couldn't find that

976
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,160
okay

977
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,599
i will

978
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,880
okay good suggestion i can end it in the

979
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,920
in the reference part

980
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,760
uh yes this is the

981
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,520
go ahead please yeah i think the

982
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,760
important part is really to uh to

983
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,480
recognize that in the past we always had

984
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,599
you know

985
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,440
a solution where the operator couldn't

986
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,760
freely choose how much to centralize and

987
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,079
how how much not to right he either had

988
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,720
to buy into the full distributed rsvp or

989
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,520
the whole sdn controller and that's not

990
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,599
the case in the teas architecture

991
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,119
exactly exactly

992
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,040
um but the g's architecture allows the

993
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,040
the hybrid yeah we really should move on

994
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,480
because we're about out of time and she

995
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,720
has a few more slides to go yeah

996
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,200
yeah thanks

997
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,760
uh i will go really fast

998
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,119
uh here is the update in this version in

999
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,040
the first section we modified the

1000
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,599
management plan specification

1001
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,520
based on the discussion in the mailing

1002
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,880
list basically these descriptions is

1003
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,000
coming from rfc

1004
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,680
7426

1005
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,640
and also in section three we remove some

1006
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,119
detailed descript descriptions of

1007
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,040
protocol extensions requirements for

1008
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,160
example igp and rsvpe and the detailed

1009
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,280
example is removed which may depend on

1010
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,119
the implementation

1011
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,079
and in section 4 we we remove some

1012
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,400
description about the streak and lose

1013
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,880
path which is also depends on the the

1014
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,040
further implementation

1015
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,319
option

1016
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,359
the next slide please

1017
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,160
ah here is some issues may need further

1018
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,480
discussion in working group

1019
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,280
the first one which has already been

1020
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,520
discussed in the main list and

1021
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,119
also in some

1022
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,680
previous meetings how to deal with the

1023
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,440
relationship between this document and

1024
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,520
other rfc and working group documents

1025
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,440
for example the architecture document

1026
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,400
has been mentioned by pascal and also

1027
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,440
the data plan framework document and

1028
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,200
also some

1029
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,560
other working group documents for

1030
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,599
example then at oem framework so

1031
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,520
suggestions from working group will be

1032
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,640
very

1033
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,280
helpful in the existing status we will

1034
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,000
treat we we would like to treat this

1035
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,760
document as an

1036
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,960
uh calibrations or explanations of the

1037
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,000
existing specifications and if there are

1038
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,760
some

1039
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,920
solutions has already been defined in

1040
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,880
other

1041
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,800
work for example young model and om

1042
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,520
framework it is virtual and it could be

1043
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,440
referred to in this document and

1044
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,839
another question is what is the scope of

1045
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,839
the net management plan

1046
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,800
the orders cannot find a very uh

1047
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,680
specific definition yet so

1048
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,520
but there are some

1049
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,560
descriptions in rc 865 and rc8938

1050
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,319
so in our existing uh

1051
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,520
understand

1052
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,760
the management plan could include the

1053
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,599
young as configuration

1054
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,079
management and also oem as fault and

1055
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,319
monitoring management

1056
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,319
if people have different understanding

1057
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,200
please also let us know

1058
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,078
a next slide please

1059
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
so what is the next step

1060
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,240
um this document uh is

1061
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,359
haven't include flow aggregation yet so

1062
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,520
we will end the flu aggregation which is

1063
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,000
very important a function in that in

1064
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,200
section 4

1065
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,079
and also we ask more input from working

1066
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,160
group is glad to see

1067
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
there are some comments

1068
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,760
in the in our discussion so please

1069
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,000
contribute if you think anything could

1070
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,440
be ended in this document

1071
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,839
okay thank you very much uh for the

1072

so we'll have presentation on our work

1083
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,720
on

1084
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,319
oem for

1085
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,480
deterministic networks using

1086
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,640
with mpos data plane and they will

1087
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,680
follow with their ip data plane uh next

1088
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,399
slide please

1089
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,280
have the controls

1090
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,440
ah i have control yes it's uh yeah okay

1091
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,319
it's a

1092
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,599
fading colors thank you

1093
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,640
okay so this is update uh we welcome our

1094
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,599
uh co-authors janice and

1095
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,000
and

1096
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,480
by this meeting we updated

1097
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,920
that net ach definition and provided

1098
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,240
specifics of

1099
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,920
flags filled and related

1100
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,560
filled in related uh i am a registry

1101
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,319
so

1102
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,440
um

1103
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,480
that

1104
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,079
ach

1105
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,560
is now different from

1106
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,480
uh where we started with their more like

1107
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,160
based on uh pseudo-wire ach

1108
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,839
uh it

1109
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,720
has a new version number so it will be

1110
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,760
uh differentiated easy to differentiate

1111
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,760
from the sudower

1112
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,359
ach

1113
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,839
it includes its own

1114
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,520
sequence number channel type

1115
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,560
and

1116
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,000
also their second long four byte long

1117
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,240
word uh carries the node id level flags

1118
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,919
and session identifier

1119
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,240
any questions

1120
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,680
okay now

1121
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,319
uh the flags

1122
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,560
uh how much uh

1123
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,960
have you been coordinating with the

1124
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,480
joint work that's going on with um

1125
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,800
pals and mpls

1126
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,640
um yeah it's a good question so um we

1127
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,720
are closely monitoring following and

1128
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,599
participating in the discussions

1129
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,800
uh of um open design team

1130
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,000
the fact that

1131
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,119
we are following on the pseudo-wire

1132
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,760
architecture where

1133
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,680
their control work

1134
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,119
or ach are expected to immediately

1135
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,240
follow

1136
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,079
the bottom of the stack

1137
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,760
label

1138
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,599
so we are in a different position

1139
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,440
so we are in this

1140
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,079
sort of a protected space

1141
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,079
that uh

1142
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,200
enhanced mpls architecture that open

1143
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,759
design team is working should not affect

1144
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,800
all right thank you i was uh that was

1145
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,400
sort of a planted question to see if we

1146
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,720
would get any comments from others who

1147
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,559
are participating looks like they're

1148
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,480
happy so we can move on

1149
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,640
yes thank you and

1150
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,880
i appreciate this um

1151
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,079
opportunity to clarify uh how we

1152
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,119
um

1153
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,640
how mpl uh that met with mpls uh is

1154
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,119
related uh to um work out enhancing mpls

1155
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,760
architecture

1156
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,119
okay so um

1157
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,400
now uh for now their uh

1158
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,520
flex field is composed of five bits

1159
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,200
filled each

1160
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,160
flag filled is one bit long

1161
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,079
and uh

1162
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,200
for now in this document uh each of them

1163
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,040
is unused

1164
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,359
and that is reflected in the proposed

1165
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,760
ayana registry

1166
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,200
that is

1167
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,760
requested to create a new deadnet mpls

1168
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,319
oem flags registry

1169
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,920
and do assignment as

1170
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,079
in this

1171
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,920
copy of the table

1172
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,920
so that's what now in the draft

1173
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,160
any specific questions about flags

1174
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,480
or the registry

1175
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,240
okay thank you

1176
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,599
so um

1177
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,200
for

1178
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,760
next steps uh we always appreciate the

1179
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,200
comments welcome suggestions

1180
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,720
and uh we are planning to work

1181
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,040
on this document and

1182
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,359
would probably ask the working group to

1183
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,680
consider uh working with last call

1184
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,480
before the next meeting

1185
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,400
okay comments questions

1186
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,680
okay will okay yes thanks

uh for the for the encoding or

1190
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,720
encapsulation of this uh

1191
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,520
uh

1192
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,760
that net oem um format um i i see there

1193
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,480
are uh there is a node id and session

1194
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,520
session

1195
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,960
uh session i id i think i remembered

1196
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,160
um

1197
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,119
but before we before we set the before

1198
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,280
we define this uh encoding of oem

1199
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,720
packets and do that we should have a i

1200
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,160
have a general uh consensus on the other

1201
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,119
on the mac on the oem mechanisms um

1202
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,520
because i see there are there is a new

1203
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,280
encoding so that's

1204
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,000
it it's different from what we have

1205
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,800
um

1206
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,200
in previous om mechanisms so

1207
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,280
i don't know if we should uh first

1208
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,240
define

1209
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,480
first to discuss the the mechanism how

1210
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,040
we use it and then we decide how to

1211
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,800
encode it

1212
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,760
i think that that is

1213
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,280
yes very good question so uh as for

1214
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,640
encoding

1215
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,240
uh we are not envisioned that

1216
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,599
okay we

1217
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,760
propose to reuse

1218
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,920
uh all the encodings

1219
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,920
that are

1220
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,359
we are familiar with uh in uh sudower

1221
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,200
encapsulation

1222
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,000
so

1223
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,040
that

1224
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,839
there are ipv4 ipv6

1225
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,040
channel types for ach and that means

1226
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,920
that

1227
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,240
that net ach

1228
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,119
can be followed immediately by ip

1229
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,240
encapsulated oem

1230
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,960
uh for example it could be

1231
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,119
lspping it could be icmp it could be a

1232
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,839
bfd control

1233
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,640
message uh in case of lspping and bfd

1234
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,839
control message with ap encapsulation

1235
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,040
so that they can use um

1236
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,640
loopback address

1237
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,440
uh whether it's uh 127s slash 8 range

1238
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,040
uh or

1239
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,800
as prescribed in

1240
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,520
5884 for example uh their

1241
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,559
range for ipv6 or it can use

1242
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,880
non-ip encapsulation of bfd

1243
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,119
so then a bfd control message will

1244
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,559
follow

1245
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,480
for example dach immediately

1246
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,800
and then it can use a tld for

1247
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,040
identifying their uh

1248
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,440
source

1249
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:20,960
uh

1250
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,160
does that answer a question

1251
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,960
yeah i understand it um

1252
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,520
i agree with what you have said but uh

1253
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,960
for the for the new uh defined um

1254
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,000
like the the session id how we use it uh

1255
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,160
actually we don't know this

1256
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,520
so oh yeah yes

1257
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:42,480
yeah

1258
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,440
actually

1259
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,839
that's a very good point and uh we

1260
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,359
welcome um suggestions and proposals

1261
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,640
uh

1262
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,800
we were thinking that

1263
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,359
um in this document

1264
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,359
we do not go into their

1265
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,559
how these fields are used so we just

1266
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,200
define them and

1267
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,040
their use will be uh defined in a

1268
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,599
further documents because for example as

1269
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,760
you noticed flags uh yes

1270
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,079
we can

1271
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,440
define

1272
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,640
some flags or all flags

1273
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,319
but that might take time so uh

1274
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:30,240
we found that it might be more practical

1275
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,880
to define these flags now

1276
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,040
and then uh let

1277
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,559
um

1278
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,040
further documents to define

1279
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,079
um and allocate particular flags because

1280
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,200
for now that's like uh unused

1281
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,000
and uh i can point that it's the

1282
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,319
approach that been um

1283
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,640
used for example in

1284
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,440
uh srh extension header in ipv6 where uh

1285
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,640
the srh defined flags

1286
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,920
uh in this

1287
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,240
base rfc and then now for example uh

1288
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,480
their proposal on

1289
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,319
oem in

1290
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,640
in srv6 defines one of the flag fields

1291
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,759
as oem field

1292
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,400
okay thank you thank you for the uh for

1293
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,839
the reply and uh i think we i i won't i

1294
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,720
uh use too much um uh too much too much

1295
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,000
time here um to uh to waste for the um

1296
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,160
to waste the at the time for the other

1297
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,480
presentations but uh let's continue with

1298
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,240
the let's continue the discussion on the

1299
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,480
mailing list uh i just want to say it's

1300
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,880
not quite ready for the

1301
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,760
working group last call yeah thank you

1302
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,599
of course let's continue the discussion

1303
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,040
on melanie west and thank you for your

1304
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,520
question

1305
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,119
okay so now i'll try to

1306
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,440
return some time because this will be

1307
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,640
another um short presentation i hope

1308
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,960
shorter than a lot of time

1309
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,240
okay so um

1310
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,160
let's uh recap

1311
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,760
what we have proposed for active

1312
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,240
ip or deadnet ip oem using that net in

1313
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,520
udp

1314
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,000
and then i will be

1315
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,920
looking at how active oem uh can realize

1316
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,880
a deadnet service sub layer

1317
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,079
in a deadnet ip environment

1318
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,920
so

1319
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,799
with their deathnet in udp encapsulation

1320
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,559
we

1321
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,799
have to map

1322
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,359
the active oem flow

1323
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,040
with their uh

1324
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,760
monitor that net flow

1325
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,839
so that to ensure

1326
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:54,880
um their fate sharing and that's it

1327
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,359
because in ip

1328
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:01,839
we have to work with their uh several

1329
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,799
active oem protocols for example

1330
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,960
um it's icmp or it's a bfd or it's a

1331
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,799
performance measurement

1332
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:14,160
whether it's a t-ramp or stamp

1333
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,160
and they usually use a

1334
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,319
udp destination port or transport

1335
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:26,079
encapsulation diff uh that is uh

1336
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,480
distinct from the death net flow

1337
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,359
any questions

1338
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,280
okay now to find

1339
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,640
fun part

1340
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:46,240
uh realizing a deadnet service sub layer

1341
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,839
for

1342
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:52,720
the detonate flow it uses mpls over udp

1343
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,440
and that's well-known and established uh

1344
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,119
technique

1345
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,880
uh for

1346
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,559
that net oem

1347
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,319
in this case

1348
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:06,240
it also must use mpls over udp

1349
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,599
and then it's naturally is

1350
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,119
sharing fate

1351
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,480
uh with the detmit flow because

1352
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,640
it can use uh the same ip

1353
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,960
the same udp and the same mpls

1354
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,480
encapsulation and then identify their

1355
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,480
active oem just using the ach

1356
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,960
and the next slide illustrates that very

1357
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,079
nicely

1358
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,880
so as you can see

1359
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,520
all the transport encapsulation

1360
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,160
for deadlift flow

1361
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,240
and

1362
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,000
active oem

1363
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,160
are identical

1364
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,400
and

1365
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,839
the differentiation only in using

1366
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:52,799
um

1367
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,799
that net control word

1368
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,160
for the deadline flow or detonate ach

1369
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,359
for

1370
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,759
active oem

1371
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,760
and um your comments suggestions

1372
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,240
yes little

1373
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,160
so

1374
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,520
you know we've talked about this in the

1375
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,799
past having a solution that leverages

1376
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,559
mpls over ip

1377
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,720
is really very straightforward and and

1378
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,240
makes a lot of sense

1379
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,720
um but we also need a solution that

1380
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,839
works when we're not running an mpls

1381
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,880
data plane and we have no mpls at all

1382
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,400
uh so really needs a solution that works

1383
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,119
for

1384
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,040
native ip

1385
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,880
and um

1386
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,040
you know i think that's uh

1387
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,440
i i think there's room in this document

1388
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,680
or maybe another document to cover that

1389
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,520
but it's really important

1390
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,640
yes i agree

1391
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,520
okay let me bring it a little bit back

1392
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,839
here so

1393
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:06,079
we are following uh the data plane

1394
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,599
encapsulation

1395
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,440
so uh that net in udp

1396
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,200
uh

1397
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,960
does not realize doesn't um that net uh

1398
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,839
service sub layer

1399
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,520
so

1400
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,520
there's there's um

1401
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,680
going back to a hallway conversation you

1402
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,200
and i had walking on the streets of

1403
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,160
singapore actually

1404
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,760
uh the

1405
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,119
a net flow or whether it's a a fully

1406
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,520
distinguished or an aggregate flow can

1407
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,720
operate just at the ip header levels uh

1408
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,319
currently we have it you know the six

1409
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,280
tuple

1410
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,839
and uh we it's important to have a

1411
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,400
solution that also works with that

1412
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,240
and as i read this

1413
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,240
it this doesn't work with any six tuple

1414
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,839
flow it only works with udv and that's

1415
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:55,839
yes uh

1416
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:59,119
with six top of four okay it then it

1417
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,680
could be udp and udp

1418
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,359
no no uh

1419
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,359
why not why

1420
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:06,880
why do you have to do encapsulation you

1421
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,119
can just do fake sharing with having an

1422
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:11,359
aggregate flow

1423
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:12,240
um

1424
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,880
i i suggest uh we talk more about this

1425
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,440
offline uh okay

1426
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,200
uh you know it'll be on me to give you

1427
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,559
that those comments um but i i the point

1428
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,200
is i think we have to cover the the full

1429
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,559
six tuple uh native ip flow as well in

1430
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,559
this document uh and i'm saying that as

1431
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,240
contributor

1432
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,839
okay thank you

1433
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:38,119
okay uh pascal please

1434
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,960
reference but greg if you want to work

1435
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,559
together we can effectively uh

1436
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,559
see how we can

1437
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,280
transport oem information natively in

1438
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,200
ipv6 using

1439
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,799
basically what we are trying with the

1440
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,200
option the that net options in my

1441
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,680
presentation a bit later in this meeting

1442
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,880
so the idea is uh pretty much like your

1443
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,640
other slide can you go back on slides

1444
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,319
it's gonna be important can you go back

1445
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,480
the other slide when yes exactly

1446
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,160
so in this slide we see that the oim is

1447
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,280
wrapped up

1448
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,760
in this case mpls right it's wrapped up

1449
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,720
on the same envelope um as

1450
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,160
uh the the

1451
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,839
the data and this envelope is actually

1452
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:25,599
a network construct which um

1453
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,599
indicates the treatment of of the

1454
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,480
packets so npls is really pointing on

1455
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,599
the path

1456
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,280
and on the treatment

1457
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,440
and inside that signaling we signal oem

1458
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,599
so basically the goal would be to do the

1459
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,240
exact same thing for ip is is have a

1460
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,480
network layer construct which signals

1461
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,119
the path the treatment and then inside

1462
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,039
that thing place one or multiple

1463
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,480
application flows and oam so yes

1464
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,799
basically realizing this but over ip

1465
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:58,799
without the udp just the two internals

1466
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,720
that's very interesting so i'm looking

1467
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,400
forward to your presentation thank you

1468
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,440
for

1469
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,000
the comment

1470
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,559
okay um so i think that uh

1471
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:15,920
well we have uh several discussions on

1472
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,520
the mailing list from these

1473
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,680
presentations and i appreciate your

1474
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,799
comments and interest and

1475
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:27,880
yes let's continue work thank you

1476
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,640
okay so this presentation is about the

1477
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,440
packet ordering function

1478
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,319
together with my uh co-post obvious here

1479
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,680
stefan ryan farkas and myself

1480
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,520
um

1481
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,760
do i have control all your message to

1482
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,079
the next slide

1483
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,200
oh yeah i have you should have control

1484
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,480
excellent

1485
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,160
sorry okay

1486
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,680
uh so

1487
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,839
the actual status is version two of this

1488
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:13,920
draft this is describing

1489
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,480
uh algorithms which can be used for

1490
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,559
packet ordering function in the deafness

1491
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,119
service sub-layer so the pocket ordering

1492
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,039
function is needed because replication

1493
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,760
and elimination

1494
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,160
by the characteristics they may result

1495
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,039
in out of order packet delivery and that

1496
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,920
can be confusing for some time sensitive

1497
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,240
applications

1498
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,200
uh

1499
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,200
version 2 was presented in the last ietf

1500
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,880
there were also discussion during the

1501
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,920
meeting after that in qatartan and also

1502
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,000
on the on the mailing list

1503
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,559
and those discussions were about

1504
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,319
the

1505
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,640
possible delay variation which is caused

1506
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,680
by the packet ordering function

1507
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,920
uh the conclusion of the discussion was

1508
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,079
that in that net we are building

1509
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:05,440
functions uh in order to achieve a given

1510
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,240
target a given end-to-end uh

1511
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,039
deterministic characteristics

1512
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:11,839
and

1513
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,280
they are intending to use uh and define

1514
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,359
building blocks in order to achieve this

1515
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,520
end-to-end characteristics

1516
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,480
uh and uh in version 2 it is already

1517
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,760
stated that it is out of scope

1518
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,920
how to eliminate the delay variation

1519
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,319
caused by the packet ordering the text

1520
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:31,520
already

1521
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,319
contains some hints

1522
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:37,119
how to do that you can use for example

1523
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,839
digital buffer or a flow regulator like

1524
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,599
a shaping function after the

1525
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:44,079
functionality uh but the draft is

1526
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,280
focusing

1527
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,400
uh exclusively only on the

1528
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,200
algorithms which are ensuring the packet

1529
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,359
ordering functions so this is why there

1530
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,400
was no

1531
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,119
update in the draft and this uh

1532
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,680
discussion resulted in that if you

1533
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,319
intend to

1534
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,559
change the delay variation or or

1535
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,880
fine-tune the delay variation then you

1536
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,119
will need additional functions after the

1537
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,079
off

1538
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,880
functionality

1539
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,400
so the content of the of the drastic

1540
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,640
draft is pretty stable uh we have

1541
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,960
received many good comments for version

1542
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,119
one and they were already included in

1543
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,359
version two which is not stable version

1544
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:28,079
from the puff algorithms perspective

1545
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,799
uh so therefore we think that uh the

1546
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:36,400
the document is stable enough and we are

1547
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,960
looking for having a verb adoption for

1548
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,440
for this document

1549
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,880
thank you any questions comments

1550
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,039
yes thoughtless please

1551
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:54,720
well at least you don't have to stand in

1552
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,400
line here the whole time but you need to

1553
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,760
click before you go to the microphone

1554
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,599
no thanks for the for the work um i

1555
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:02,880
think the

1556
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,200
the difficult part that that hasn't been

1557
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,079
approached now is that uh

1558
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:10,160
all this what what i would love to see

1559
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,960
ultimately is i guess a

1560
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,440
normative standard yang document

1561
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,079
that exposes the parameters of whatever

1562
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,000
puff is being done

1563
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,640
so that when we go into deployments the

1564
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,839
the yang model gives us the

1565
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,520
knowledge that that we can actually

1566
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,280
build a controller plane that has the

1567
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,680
necessary information and obviously

1568
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,160
um such such a young model would have to

1569
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,520
be built from

1570
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,119
what we're describing here more

1571
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,200
informationally and i'm not sure what

1572
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,039
the processes we're doing and if we even

1573
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,520
agree on that goal to to getting a

1574
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,000
normative yang model to to expose all

1575
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,200
the relevant parameters

1576
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,319
i think it would be interesting to have

1577
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,720
such a young model not only for the puff

1578
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,599
but for all the other service sub layer

1579
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,440
and forwarding sub layer functions as

1580
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,400
well

1581
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,319
so i think that that is definitely

1582
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,720
something that is that is needed i i

1583
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,119
agree with that from from this document

1584
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,839
perspective we have defined the

1585
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:13,119
configuration parameters

1586
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,079
which

1587
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,440
which

1588
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,399
are

1589
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:19,198
uh configured for the both algorithms

1590
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:21,520
described in this document so the

1591
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,520
parameters are defined

1592
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,759
and for the young model i think we are

1593
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,479
missing not only for both but for other

1594
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,520
functions as well uh extension to the to

1595
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,759
the young model that we already have for

1596
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,158
for that

1597
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,799
yeah and and and hopefully you know a

1598
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:41,040
young model as difficult as yang is to

1599
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,000
just

1600
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,238
i mean it still seems to be the

1601
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:46,238
the best way for us to standardize the

1602
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,719
data model is you know i mean that i

1603
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,238
guess uh

1604
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:52,960
yeah um

1605
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,359
yeah there there's some some yeah

1606
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:56,719
thank you i think we're running out of

1607
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:58,319
time

1608
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,000
yeah i'll just remind you both we're

1609
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,759
contribution driven so a uh a draft that

1610
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,000
augments our existing yang model model

1611
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,479
or even a completely independent one if

1612
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,359
appropriate is always welcome

1613
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,839
pascal

1614
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,759
and me the

1615
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,600
presentation for the slides

1616
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,759
oh i think i have them okay okay very

1617
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:25,759
neat many thanks look um so yeah the

1618
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,920
this is basically a continuation of the

1619
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,920
discussion we just had uh on greg's

1620
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,560
slide about being able to transport

1621
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,040
multiple types of flow using a network

1622
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,040
construct that is independent of the

1623
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,600
application construct so the application

1624
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,439
constructs read the circuit is is

1625
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,359
expressed by the five six tuples it

1626
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,359
retells you what the application flow is

1627
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,679
and that's what the architecture says

1628
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,759
on the other hand if we want to be able

1629
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,920
to transport multiple objects including

1630
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,800
oam and aggregated flows

1631
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
it might be ideal just like we did for

1632
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,040
mpls to have a network construct that

1633
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,760
expresses what the network should be

1634
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,520
doing for this collection of packets

1635
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,640
regardless of the flows or of the oem

1636
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,719
data being transported

1637
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,600
and effectively ipv6 uh provide that

1638
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,560
sort of constructs uh it's done through

1639
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,199
extension headers like the hub by hub

1640
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:20,159
uh the destination uh information object

1641
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:24,000
and and the source routing editor so

1642
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
depending on what you really want to do

1643
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,920
i mean one or the other of those

1644
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,640
extension letters is ideal

1645
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,360
for instance in in the art of

1646
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,280
ripple and now for vtn

1647
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,360
ids that was discussed at six months

1648
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,719
this morning

1649
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:43,760
the hub by hub header is being used

1650
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,400
to

1651
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,239
express a uh a logical topology

1652
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:51,040
i see that craig is speaking already

1653
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,960
greg do you want me to finish this slide

1654
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,480
and then you you speak or do you want to

1655
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,000
speak now

1656
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,360
i want to be first in the queue

1657
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,719
okay

1658
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:03,040
okay okay so just let me do this slide

1659
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,760
and and then uh i'll point to you so

1660
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,000
basically i was saying that um the

1661
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,840
concept of expressing a a logical

1662
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,840
topology uh using a hub by hop header as

1663
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,080
already some history at the atf and

1664
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,080
there is effectively uh for virtual

1665
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,560
transport network for instance a draft

1666
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,520
which is work document at xman which

1667
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,440
encodes the vtl id

1668
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,000
into uh hobby hop header in the same

1669
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,159
fashion repo as the ripple option which

1670
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,880
is also encoded in hub by hub header to

1671
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,480
express what we call an instance which

1672
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,880
is also a virtual topology so if we

1673
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,679
consider that a path

1674
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:41,760
which is a complex beast between a an

1675
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,440
ingress and negras

1676
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,880
is

1677
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,960
is a topology is a logical topology it

1678
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,960
just makes sense to do what the others

1679
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,600
do um and and express it as a hobby

1680
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,480
repeater in particular because we want

1681
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,120
that every node on the path is as the

1682
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,440
forwarding stab layer operation so it

1683
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,120
makes for sense to encode it in half by

1684
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,440
operator the cool thing about

1685
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,840
operator is that it's completely

1686
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,480
uh near the it's the first thing after

1687
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,199
the ipv6 header so if you if you need a

1688
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,880
other implementation

1689
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,360
um and that cannot go you know beyond

1690
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,440
say 64 or 128 bytes then having the robe

1691
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,760
up header immediately after the ipv6

1692
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,440
header allows you to process it in

1693
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,480
hardware

1694
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,320
so that's pretty important for

1695
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,920
forwarding now for for the service sub

1696
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,199
layer

1697
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,840
not every hub necessarily processes it

1698
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,360
it's only the relays

1699
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,400
so

1700
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,159
another way of encoding that that could

1701
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:39,840
be substitutable

1702
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,199
is uh using srh which uh

1703
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:44,880
source rotator basically which indicates

1704
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,400
what the relays are

1705
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,400
and the destination option

1706
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,199
that

1707
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,880
provides the service supplier

1708
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,920
information just before the srh and that

1709
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,080
actually uh how it's going to be

1710
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,159
processed by the intermediate hubs which

1711
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,960
are signaling the srh so basically all

1712
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,960
we're saying is

1713
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,280
instead of of looking at the application

1714
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,199
signaling which is the five double one

1715
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,760
which can be far far in the packet it

1716
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,480
might make a lot more sense to to wrap

1717
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,239
the things we want to process the same

1718
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,880
way which share a common fade

1719
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,679
in a layer 3 signaling

1720
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,440
and and the extension editor are fine

1721
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,640
for that

1722
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,080
and greg there we go

1723
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,639
greg

1724
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,480
yeah now it's off okay unmuted uh thank

1725
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,120
you for this um

1726
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,440
presentation for the uh

1727
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,719
putting it uh so clearly together uh

1728
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,880
i've been following discussion in six

1729
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,760
men on a uh hub by hop uh

1730
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,679
extension header

1731
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:55,120
so my understanding is that yes there is

1732
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,840
a requirement or i would say probably

1733
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,360
expectation

1734
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,199
that

1735
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:04,719
each node will decide on its own whether

1736
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,840
it can uh capable of processing

1737
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,440
a

1738
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:13,360
received hub by hub extension header

1739
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,960
at line rate

1740
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,760
and if it's not then it will just

1741
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,960
forward it so as a result or as i

1742
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,440
understand it

1743
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,400
the processing of

1744
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,320
how by hub extension header is not

1745
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,840
guaranteed

1746
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,920
unless we

1747
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,600
tighten our

1748
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,159
unless we tighten our requirements for

1749
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,719
the domain for the nodes that are in the

1750
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,040
main in encapsulations

1751
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,040
so that we can ensure

1752
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:47,440
that in that net ip uh domain with ipv6

1753
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,960
data plane

1754
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,600
uh the processing of uh

1755
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:56,080
that net top by hub extension or

1756
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,840
hubba hub headers that used

1757
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,520
uh by that net is guaranteed

1758
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,360
yeah i mean that's the

1759
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,880
most of the prime you're talking about

1760
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,000
is because

1761
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,679
the ipv6 by hop document

1762
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,600
is for the global internet

1763
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,679
um as soon as you you're in a local

1764
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:19,199
domain uh which is by charter.net

1765
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:21,199
uh this prime goes away i mean if you

1766
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,199
want to deploy that net you will

1767
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,040
have to have that net support on every

1768
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,920
router and you will deploy routers which

1769
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,560
support whatever signaling you place in

1770
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,280
for that net so the point is not the

1771
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,880
capability of the routers because for

1772
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,199
limited domain you will effectively have

1773
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,000
the right routers whether it's over udp

1774
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,080
or if it's uh

1775
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,239
right after the ipv6 header

1776
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:47,920
but you might have trouble

1777
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,960
uh implementing it on other

1778
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,640
much and silicon

1779
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,480
if the the

1780
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,239
that net signaling is beyond the first

1781
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,320
64 bytes

1782
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,600
and that will be a prime because

1783
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,800
if if you are above udp basically

1784
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,880
for some harder platforms whereas

1785
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,480
placing it in the hub by half gives you

1786
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,719
much better guarantee that you can find

1787
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,320
more routers which are capable of

1788
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,000
processing it

1789
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
so yes the biop is not guaranteed but

1790
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,480
that's in the internet at large in your

1791
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,719
limited domain yes you will deploy the

1792
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,239
routers which support whatever you want

1793
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:23,120
to do

1794
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,880
and hop by up is actually easier than

1795
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,480
above your dp

1796
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,400
yes uh what

1797
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,239
i think that and that

1798
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,320
uh probably will discuss it on the

1799
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,800
mainland list and uh

1800
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,159
in following discussions is uh the

1801
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,800
impact or interworking with there are

1802
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,080
this mechanism and other extension

1803
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:48,480
headers for example uh srh

1804
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,800
okay so uh i will skip the next slide it

1805
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,880
pretty much shows that you know the uh

1806
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,480
extension the hub by heart is right

1807
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,480
after the ipv6 header whereas the

1808
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,239
transport can be far far away depending

1809
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,560
on how many other idles you have which

1810
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,640
which can be a prime in some ip networks

1811
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,880
where the hardware cannot go too deep

1812
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,640
inside the packet

1813
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,719
um so the requirements are twofold uh

1814
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,320
we've got all the redundancy in the

1815
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,400
service tab layer and we've got what i

1816
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,640
was talking about the envelope of your

1817
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,159
multiple uh application flows plus oam

1818
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,920
and so that's that's why we have two

1819
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,159
different types of options proposed in

1820
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:33,440
the document

1821
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,960
three tests of time i'm moving on

1822
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:37,840
so

1823
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,239
um

1824
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,600
yeah that

1825
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,360
we insist in the draft and i guess the

1826
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,960
raw architectural system that as well

1827
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,920
not to to to confuse what we call the

1828
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,920
water and what we call the pipe

1829
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,199
the water is the application flows and

1830
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:56,960
and there is signaling for that which is

1831
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,480
really under the control of the

1832
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,080
application in the network we don't

1833
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,360
control uh the tagging of uh

1834
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,080
uh

1835
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,080
of the ports and and the upper layer

1836
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,320
protocol that signal the application

1837
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,199
flow so using them inside the network is

1838
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,199
actually um

1839
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,920
sometimes complicated whereas having

1840
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,000
like mpls our own

1841
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,159
tag in the packets which we can use to

1842
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,679
to to find our state and our operation

1843
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,400
is a lot easier so so that's really a

1844
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,320
reason why we we want to place it in a

1845
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,320
hub by a hub as opposed to leveraging

1846
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,159
the five double the other problem with

1847
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,000
the five tuple is you would need a five

1848
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,600
to four inside the five topol if you

1849
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,679
want to merge oam and other and the

1850
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,920
application flows here we are a lot more

1851
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,640
economical because we just place

1852
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,640
a tag which which basically indicates

1853
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,159
the virtual topology that you want to

1854
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:48,480
follow

1855
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:54,800
and yes um current version is seven so

1856
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,120
we we added effectively to to greg's

1857
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,000
point

1858
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,840
uh some text

1859
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,000
uh regarding the various encapsulation

1860
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
and the placement of the headers so greg

1861
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,719
if you look at the new text and the

1862
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,800
submission by fan and fun joined as

1863
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,080
co-author

1864
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,440
um and then we we in section in

1865
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,800
seven we

1866
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,440
uh enrich the application section

1867
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,280
so we position better versus the debt

1868
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,040
and architecture which shows it's a good

1869
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,000
fit and it's time to stop but basically

1870
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,679
many thanks to alice and brian for the

1871
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,800
comments and uh we'll publish very soon

1872
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,239
the new version which incorporates that

1873
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:34,960
and i'm pretty much done if we have any

1874
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,400
question

1875
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,159
oh and thanks for cheering us we don't

1876
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,640
really have time unfortunately for

1877
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,760
questions

1878
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,000
uh i think this is really interesting

1879
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,159
work um we do have room in our charter

1880
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:47,040
for

1881
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,159
uh more

1882
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,560
enhanced or uh actually not even more

1883
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,080
enhanced this was just a more

1884
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,239
sophisticated uh

1885
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:56,159
data plane ip data plane support we

1886
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,000
always called the original five tuple

1887
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,920
the simplified approach so

1888
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,320
this this certainly fits in

1889
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,400
whether or not you use hop by hop or

1890
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,360
maybe even flow id i know that's not uh

1891
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,560
uh that's being frowned upon but uh it

1892
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,639
it would be good to talk over with

1893
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,320
influence

1894
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:17,679
when you say it flower you mean

1895
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,560
yeah the problem with flow labor and

1896
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,880
and five topo it's it's the end point

1897
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,520
decision so it's for one flow for the

1898
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,000
next flow that wants to fair shade to to

1899
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,679
surface well i don't know

1900
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,600
share the same fate you have a pride of

1901
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,600
signaling uh we should leave the

1902
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,280
endpoint application level stuff to the

1903
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,280
end points and and do our own construct

1904
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,199
for the network just like mpls does it

1905
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,880
makes a lot more sense

1906
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,960
sure but it would be good to socialize

1907
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,719
the uh the idea also in sixth man um oh

1908
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:49,040
yes oh yeah oh yeah and the vtn id is

1909
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,560
being socialized and this morning i

1910
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,639
asked a question effectively on that

1911
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,080
because we are doing the same thing in

1912
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,520
role in in

1913
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,600
well you know what he is right that's

1914
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,400
great

1915
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,480
we should move on pascal we should move

1916
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,638
on

1917
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,360
uh thank you very much appreciate it

1918
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,960
and for the next presenter i think

1919
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,120
you're squeezed down to eight minutes

1920
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,000
and

1921
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
uh okay

1922
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,639
i'm handing you slide control now

1923
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:15,920
okay okay

1924
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,840
this is panel from china mobile and it

1925
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,520
is a requirement of lightsaber

1926
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:24,080
vietnamese network exercise please

1927
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,719
okay another size uh you have control on

1928
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,960
the bottom you should be able to select

1929
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,960
just underneath the slide okay okay yeah

1930
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,040
i'll say it that's it yeah

1931
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,360
um

1932
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,199
okay uh first is the recap but i can't

1933
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,199
see it clearly

1934
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,360
yeah i can't either um

1935
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,320
uh

1936
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,080
yeah i guess i'm trying to is there any

1937
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,520
problem

1938
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,040
yes but but like i could actually say

1939
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,600
um the cap and motivation it was

1940
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,920
presented first in the interim without a

1941
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,480
draft but absorbed some good points from

1942
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,080
the earlier draft

1943
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,560
and since there was a positive feedback

1944
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,480
we submit and presented a new draft

1945
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,880
based on the slides last meeting and

1946
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,520
before this meeting we merged another

1947
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,840
requirement draft according to chess

1948
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,719
suggestion and addressed the comments in

1949
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:17,760
the

1950
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,440
last meeting and offline so the

1951
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,840
motivation of the document is to point

1952
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,159
out different aspects in large skills

1953
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:26,480
and mystical network such as

1954
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,960
magnesium and also has

1955
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,320
a little others

1956
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,320
okay

1957
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,600
oh good

1958
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,800
and

1959
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,920
some facts are that the domestic network

1960
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,679
prototypes and the trials have been

1961
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,040
performed

1962
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,239
based on the the pro pro predatory

1963
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:57,120
mechanisms in logistical network and the

1964
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,040
experience from them will use that as

1965
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,760
the input to this document

1966
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,040
next time

1967
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,560
i control it by myself so forget it

1968
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,960
and uh from the last meeting got some

1969
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,040
comments and those uh

1970
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,600
uh other updates uh we merged another

1971
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,159
requirement draft had two technical

1972
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,000
requirements show the internet two

1973
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,840
slides and the ad an

1974
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,199
example of

1975
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:24,159
in electric mix and

1976
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:25,760
telecommunic

1977
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,800
communications research into and move to

1978
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,920
the example of the trial to appendix for

1979
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,400
reference based on the contribution

1980
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,440
added

1981
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,560
tolerance chain and jingdom

1982
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,400
has cursors and also removes these two

1983
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,880
based on the

1984
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,880
comments

1985
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,400
so this is the first to added

1986
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,400
requirements support configuration of

1987
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,639
multiple queuing mechanisms um there

1988
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:57,760
will be the level uh

1989
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,520
servers fight

1990
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,760
determines the traffic flow for what is

1991
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,320
based on different mechanism in some

1992
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,280
network device of flight square network

1993
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,199
and for instance the network aggregation

1994
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:14,719
device may need to support both

1995
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,719
ts and ats so the network device shows

1996
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,719
the ports multiple

1997
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,080
parameters and the coding is unified or

1998
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,199
simplified configuration and management

1999
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,280
i expected to be support

2000
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,960
so for the distributed and centralized

2001
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,320
scenarios

2002
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,600
some

2003
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,280
simple requirements

2004
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,080
for the advertising or some resource

2005
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,880
topological when needed

2006
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,560
and

2007
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,719
this is the

2008
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:49,280
second added requirement uh is to

2009
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,360
support current mechanisms which over

2010
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,560
cross multi-domains um

2011
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,199
it may cross multi-domains and

2012
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:58,560
adopt a

2013
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,760
variety of different mechanisms within

2014
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,159
instrument so it is required to support

2015
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:08,480
the interdependent mechanisms at inter

2016
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,440
domain boundary nodes such as

2017
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,239
a priority but redefinition and

2018
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,080
rescheduling of cues

2019
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,880
moreover changing from the one queuing

2020
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,120
mechanism to another may generate

2021
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,320
additional end-to-end latency or data so

2022
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,120
a collaboration mechanisms of course

2023
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,520
multidimensions must be considered

2024
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,480
such as

2025
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,000
the increasing

2026
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,639
buffer or interdependent device to

2027
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:35,920
provide

2028
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,000
enough adjustment

2029
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,639
space for the flow to across different

2030
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:43,280
magnets

2031
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:44,960
and

2032
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,480
this is the appendix about the trials um

2033
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,159
here's a new

2034
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:52,800
remote industrial internet of

2035
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,560
things

2036
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,600
service

2037
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,560
of

2038
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,440
eti and data through three different

2039
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,560
operators network and demonstrates the

2040
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,120
real-time

2041
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:06,840
with a smart factory

2042
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:10,480
and the low latency and from the jitter

2043
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,760
showed here

2044
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,320
so some thicker way is that strong

2045
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,440
motivations and demand on the

2046
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,080
enhancements about life skill than that

2047
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,199
and

2048
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:22,639
the pro

2049
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:26,000
battery uh mechanisms coexist with uh

2050
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,800
thunder technology in trials

2051
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,960
so there might be some enhancement to

2052
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,600
support it

2053
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:35,600
and then

2054
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,199
here is the overall technique

2055
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,120
requirements

2056
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,360
and first a thoroughly time

2057
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,159
uh synchronization

2058
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,520
um

2059
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,199
considering the in the large-scale

2060
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:49,040
network there might be some device comes

2061
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,320
about the

2062
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,120
synchronization and the second one is

2063
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,040
supports the large-scale

2064
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,800
single-hook propagation latency

2065
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,960
brings

2066
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,159
long-distance latency to support it and

2067
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:07,040
the third one is accommodates a higher

2068
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,960
inner speed and

2069
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,920
force is key over to numerous network

2070
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,320
devices and massive traffic flows

2071
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,760
and the fifth tolerant figures of links

2072
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:21,360
or notes and topology changes because

2073
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,960
those will bring

2074
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,360
maybe second levels

2075
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,880
latency

2076
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,239
additionally yes and six and seven was

2077
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:33,040
introduced before so

2078
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,239
next is that um

2079
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,239
considering the recharger

2080
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,719
of the wg we extract some potential data

2081
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:41,520
plan

2082
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,320
uh implications from the requirements

2083
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,840
the first is a uh ipv6 extend header

2084
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,639
based enhancement to supports the native

2085
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,480
app basic network

2086
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,639
and currently there is no change of the

2087
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:58,000
extension headers

2088
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,920
and the second is the array don't say

2089
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,760
related files for the

2090
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,120
free off then ps data plan uh suppose

2091
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,840
while the native ipv6 data plan doesn't

2092
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,400
have the files okay third one is for the

2093
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,000
aggregation

2094
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,280
um

2095
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,600
flow identification

2096
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,639
um

2097
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,440
the ipv6 aggregate flow identification

2098
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,520
is supposed by five or six

2099
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,120
turbo ib uh prefix or wheel cards

2100
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,960
it is a local window that works more but

2101
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,400
in english skills the number of

2102
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,280
individual flow charts that may randomly

2103
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,199
join and leave the

2104
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,520
uh aggregated flow

2105
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,679
um so in some cases

2106
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:40,000
the flow can't be identified by the

2107
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,880
predictor with the cards

2108
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,960
finally is some conclusion about the

2109
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,400
queue related information to be

2110
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,120
considered such as cycle specification

2111
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,560
or the time

2112
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,800
step or time information

2113
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,120
like fields so

2114
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,679
next is since they dropped up absorbed

2115
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,280
the earlier draft merge another

2116
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,639
requirement dropped and got enough

2117
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:02,800
discussion the notification and online

2118
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,880
offline would like to request for an

2119
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,080
adoption call as a start point

2120
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,719
for the enhanced requirements document

2121
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:13,920
thanks and any comments

2122
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,520
unfortunately we don't have time for

2123
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,480
more discussion um so others it would be

2124
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,440
good to

2125
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,880
uh

2126
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,760
if you have comments take it to the list

2127
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,560
i'm particularly interested in if we're

2128
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,480
missing requirements

2129
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,280
uh

2130
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,320
you know we showed on the milestones

2131
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,639
that we would like to

2132
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:37,360
get a document to

2133
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,159
on enhanced data plane uh this seems to

2134
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:43,040
be the one that is the likely candidate

2135
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,400
uh so we'd like to see some more

2136
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,480
discussion and probably poll

2137
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,360
uh

2138
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:50,080
for adoption as soon as next month

2139
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,920
um so thank you very much for this uh

2140
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,679
contribution

2141
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:56,320
okay thank you

2142
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:58,320
next up i believe

2143
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,480
is

2144
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,440
uh twirlis

2145
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:07,840
oops i hit the wrong one

2146
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,199
uh twereless you're in the room do you

2147
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:13,360
want someone else to advance for you

2148
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,560
where do you have the

2149
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,400
the app i'll give it to

2150
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,280
maybe

2151
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,440
luis if you don't mind advancing right

2152
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,600
this the sound is so echoey it's really

2153
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,080
hard to understand uh next slide

2154
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:27,280
or first light sorry i

2155
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,360
need to manage this probably

2156
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,599
yes

2157
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,480
all right so uh

2158
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,639
wanted to

2159
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,639
re-summarize um

2160
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:42,080
the high level what we're trying to

2161
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,360
achieve here next slide

2162
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,840
um

2163
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,400
so we think we need according to the you

2164
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,120
know previous presentation a uh

2165
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,199
standardized bounded latency solution

2166
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:58,159
for large-scale high-speed networks um

2167
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,960
and if we look at what we you know are

2168
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,880
kind of under the hood thinking of being

2169
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,679
available today that has been proven i

2170
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:08,880
think we have um the guaranteed services

2171
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,320
from rsc 2212 and tsn ats as the two

2172
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,560
mechanisms that i think people who have

2173
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,480
worked in tsn

2174
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,040
no we don't have the yang models um

2175
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,280
there is a proposal for rspdp for that

2176
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,360
but if we look at both of these queuing

2177
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,840
mechanisms they really have three

2178
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:26,719
core

2179
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:28,960
issues right so one is the insufficiency

2180
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,280
for applications because of the fact

2181
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,960
that they have the maximum

2182
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,000
jitter

2183
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,320
because it's load dependent

2184
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,159
and that may lead to a lot more

2185
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,800
complicated applications with clock

2186
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,880
synchronization on small iot end

2187
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,120
endpoints as opposed to only in the

2188
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,400
network

2189
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,040
the second one is the um

2190
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:52,400
an expensive scalability because of the

2191
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,120
per hop state required in service

2192
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,639
provider networks

2193
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:57,440
and

2194
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,280
then of course kind of like as a

2195
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,520
follow-up the non-applicability

2196
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,520
to um

2197
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,159
current and future uh forwarding planes

2198
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:09,199
that can operate stateless like sr mpls

2199
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:12,719
srv6 and for multicast beer or other

2200
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:14,320
similar upcoming ones so those are the

2201
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,960
three big limitations of these uh

2202
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,280
well-known um queuing mechanism next

2203
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,120
slide

2204
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,520
so and then there is tsn cyclic queuing

2205
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,159
and forwarding which is another um tsn

2206
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:28,400
proven standardized solution and that

2207
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,639
solves problem one and two

2208
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,159
but it doesn't really work for high

2209
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:34,400
speed or wide area networks because the

2210
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,760
cycles

2211
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,400
on adjacent nodes need to be matched by

2212
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,159
the synchronized clock so that means

2213
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:42,719
that they don't support arbitrary length

2214
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:45,520
with the latency and jitter and require

2215
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,320
an extremely high clock accuracy linear

2216
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,600
to the speed of the network so so far to

2217
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,120
the best of my knowledge that has been

2218
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,719
proven to only

2219
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,440
work up to 10 gigabit per second so that

2220
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,080
brings us to the uh wrong indented tech

2221
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,000
cycling and queuing forwarding that

2222
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,080
we're proposing which is really an

2223
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,080
enhanced version of the cyclic and

2224
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:09,040
queuing from tsn um and it solves that

2225
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,120
high speed when link issues by carrying

2226
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,840
the cycle identity type identifier not

2227
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,840
just internally in the node and updated

2228
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,480
by the clock but it's in the packet and

2229
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,960
that basically makes it easy to support

2230
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,520
arbitrary latency links even with jitter

2231
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,760
and there are high-speed implementations

2232
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,239
as proof-of-concept pre-standard um

2233
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:32,880
obviously uh with uh equal to or larger

2234
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:36,400
than 100 gigabit interfaces and deployed

2235
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,800
for testing in a 2 000 mile long network

2236
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,000
in china

2237
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,159
next slide

2238
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:43,040
so

2239
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,960
we we talked about this

2240
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,080
on the last

2241
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,000
session it's also in the draft it kind

2242
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,560
of explains how the more cycles you

2243
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,199
configure into the solution the more

2244
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:56,320
leniency you have against

2245
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,360
latency variation or time interval areas

2246
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,239
in your clock synchronization protocol

2247
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:05,199
so basically uh it's it's also flexible

2248
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:06,880
in so far is that it can

2249
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,080
um you know by mean of configuration of

2250
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,320
more than three cycles uh accommodate

2251
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:16,880
for more uh variances next slide

2252
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,480
so right so

2253
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,760
the draft that we have um was the

2254
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,600
attempt to try to

2255
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,840
get two things out of it right so one is

2256
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,880
to propose a standard tcqf mechanism

2257
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,520
with the per-hop state machinery that

2258
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,400
could support any type of tagging

2259
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,560
even you know different hubs along the

2260
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:39,040
network could use different tagging like

2261
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,440
one uses ip the other mpls not that

2262
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:44,159
that's realistic in current networks

2263
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:47,119
and then really only standardize here

2264
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:48,159
the one

2265
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:50,560
tagging that we know we can do without

2266
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,960
expanding any forwarding plane but just

2267
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,639
using the one forwarding plane we

2268
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:55,920
already have

2269
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,000
almost everything else which is the mpls

2270
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,040
forwarding plane with the traffic

2271
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,840
class field which just relies on rfc

2272
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,000
3270

2273
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,080
and that's the easiest to operationalize

2274
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:11,119
uh thing and this is what we this is the

2275
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,880
draft we want to

2276
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,119
ask.net to adopt as a working group

2277
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:18,560
draft um next slide

2278
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,560
and so then obviously there is the

2279
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,719
question of what's the adjacent work

2280
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:24,480
right so obviously we want the yang

2281
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:28,480
model to specify the configurability

2282
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,560
there is the open question of

2283
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,639
the ingress policing into the network

2284
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:35,440
which i think is a general purpose issue

2285
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,480
in the case of this queuing it's not

2286
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,719
only the policing but there is a tagging

2287
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,400
with the appropriate cycle

2288
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,119
added to it as an edit requirement but i

2289
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:46,800
think it could go either into this

2290
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,960
document as a as a section that hasn't

2291
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,639
been written yet or it could be a

2292
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,440
separate document and then of course we

2293
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,080
could equally then once we agree in that

2294
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,360
net that this is

2295
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,679
a scheduling queuing mechanism that we

2296
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,360
do want to support i think much more

2297
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,040
easily code to other working groups

2298
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,440
accordingly um right the tagging for

2299
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:09,840
others one like dscp probably with tsvwg

2300
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,679
and then of course the whole question of

2301
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:14,239
how do we do it with srv6 where we may

2302
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:15,920
want to have a source routing header

2303
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,920
that per hop

2304
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,119
indicates the the tag something i think

2305
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,199
where even an old and draft existed

2306
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,199
right but to me that's adjacent work

2307
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:27,679
just bring it up to the point here that

2308
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,639
it is relevant to you know the adoption

2309
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,800
call for for for this draft which we

2310
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,400
would like to have

2311
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,000
and i think that's it next slide i think

2312
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,840
that yep thank you very much

2313
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,440
uh thank you trois for this work as we

2314
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,119
mentioned we're going to give some time

2315
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:46,080
for

2316
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,239
other solutions to

2317
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:51,760
be proposed before considering adoption

2318
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,600
probably around the next ietf is when

2319
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,880
we'll

2320
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,960
look to do

2321
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,560
adoption of

2322
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,560
solutions for

2323
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,520
treatment enhancements

2324
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,239
but of course any anything that you know

2325
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:08,000
people would like to see improved on the

2326
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,159
document right as as early as possible

2327
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:15,119
do you do you hear me

2328
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,360
uh yes torellis was just making a

2329
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,040
comment if you could let him just finish

2330
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,800
his comment and then and then go tour

2331
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,000
list do you want to make her finish your

2332
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,239
comment i know that that was is right so

2333
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,119
thanks

2334
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:28,800
okay thanks uh go ahead

2335
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,880
okay uh thank you

2336
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,560
my question is not

2337
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,040
only for dollars but all but also for

2338
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,880
chairs and do do we plan to adopt one

2339
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,560
data plane solution for a qm mechanism

2340
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,360
or

2341
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:46,480
uh it or it may be better to define uh

2342
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,880
try to define a generic data plane

2343
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,920
solution to cover all kinds of uh cream

2344
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,280
mechanisms

2345
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:57,440
um because the this this draft has

2346
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,800
mentioned

2347
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:04,400
ipv6 nps and srv6 for the tcqf

2348
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,280
and we maybe we have other

2349
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:10,800
queueing mechanisms then we will have

2350
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,920
many uh display solutions

2351
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,520
so if

2352
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,440
my answer to that would be that i would

2353
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,119
hope that the debt networking group has

2354
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,320
space for

2355
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,320
multiple you know bounded latency

2356
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,239
queuing or scheduling mechanism as we

2357
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,080
want to call them i was just thinking

2358
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,000
that this one would be the

2359
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,560
one that would be most easy to justify

2360
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:33,920
as a standardizing first because we've

2361
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,520
got the deployment experience it's

2362
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,360
derived from something that has even

2363
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:40,239
more deployment experience with psn so i

2364
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:42,320
mean we have nice research work for

2365
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,080
something that we you know think might

2366
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,080
long term be even better but where you

2367
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,920
know high-speed hardware implementation

2368
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,560
experience is missing so and it may be

2369
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,800
the same would be a problem probably

2370
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,639
true for for other cool ideas that are

2371
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,719
being brought to that net so maybe we

2372
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:59,040
should look at you know

2373
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:02,000
the realistic uh timeline of adoption in

2374
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,480
actual uh high-speed networks as as a

2375
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,040
factor to guide us but not uh prohibit

2376
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:09,520
something to happen

2377
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:10,960
yeah and quan

2378
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,239
i think you're actually getting at the

2379
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:13,840
point that there's a difference between

2380
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,600
queuing and marking

2381
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,480
and

2382
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,920
um

2383
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,880
the

2384
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:19,920
uh

2385
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,080
the data the mark marking tends to be

2386
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,679
data plane specific and we would expect

2387
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:26,000
that to be in individual documents the

2388
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,679
base queueing mechanism could be in a

2389
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:29,440
shared document or even show up in the

2390
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,440
in one document one data plane document

2391
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,199
first and then be referenced

2392
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:36,080
um by subsequent ones we do see that

2393
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,760
there's um

2394
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,679
definitely different data planes were

2395
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,280
managing uh and there we uh talked about

2396
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,400
this being there being a first document

2397
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,560
for a solution and that we may entertain

2398
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,520
multiple but as usual as i said multiple

2399
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,119
times we're contribution driven so if

2400
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,760
you have an alternative um

2401
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:58,159
it'd be really interesting to see

2402
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:59,840
see the uh

2403
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,080
contribution on that and there is time

2404
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,760
before we talk about adoption on this

2405
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,800
one specifically to to

2406
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,080
allow for more documents to be published

2407
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,920
and with that we really any subsequent

2408
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,080
discussion has to go to the list and we

2409
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,520
need to move on to the next

2410
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,280
presentations where they won't have any

2411
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,199
time so let's be fair to them no no

2412
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:21,360
let's be fair to the others please and

2413
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:22,960
uh move on

2414
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,719
so i think uh

2415
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:28,080
uh i'm not sure who's presenting next

2416
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,760
uh but i'm sorry not that somebody

2417
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,600
opened the doors again in the room and i

2418
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,440
don't hear you because there is all this

2419
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,960
noise coming in from the outside so it's

2420
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,199
really ah okay i'm sorry i can't uh

2421
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,119
sorry about that

2422
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:41,840
uh so

2423
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,719
you should be able to present

2424
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,759
we don't hear you

2425
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,440
so we're going to skip this presentation

2426
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,199
and come back to the person at the end

2427
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:34,719
hopefully they can fix their mic

2428
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:37,280
problems between now and then

2429
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,119
my apologies

2430
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:42,920
but we can't hear you

2431
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,440
so we're going to

2432
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:49,840
[Music]

2433
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,040
the one-way delay measurement

2434
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,520
uh high chair can you hear me

2435
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,920
uh yes you sound something and you

2436
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,520
should have yeah thank you

2437
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,639
uh yeah yeah thank you um okay uh next

2438
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:07,199
page please

2439
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:09,840
and from channel

2440
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,280
yeah you have controls at the bottom of

2441
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,800
your screen

2442
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,440
okay thank you very much sorry

2443
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,239
so

2444
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:18,400
um today i'm gonna

2445
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,400
give a presentation about the

2446
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,480
uh my draft on the uh reference

2447
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,480
delay-based mechanism

2448
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,920
about the along with the delay

2449
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,000
measurement so one delay marine is very

2450
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,840
important and uh

2451
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,040
is a great performance indicator for sla

2452
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,119
guarantee and especially for some

2453
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:39,040
scenarios in 5g network so owd the one

2454
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,440
with that delay environment is not novel

2455
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,119
research many

2456
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:45,920
studies have been down in years before

2457
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,679
and especially some

2458
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:50,239
offices also been published in ip

2459
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:52,800
performance environment group

2460
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:56,239
but our proposal is quite different and

2461
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:59,440
so it's based on a prerequisite about

2462
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,280
the net so

2463
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,400
that's why we want to

2464
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:07,360
you know predict this in needs in that

2465
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:08,480
net group

2466
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,600
so uh you can see that

2467
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,239
the current deployment of the

2468
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,800
uh one-way delay measurement

2469
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:17,679
uh

2470
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:19,119
deployment is

2471
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:22,560
always is all usually based on some uh

2472
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,360
clock synchronization you can then such

2473
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,440
as pdp or gps

2474
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,320
but the deployment cost is quite high or

2475
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,239
uh if what if you want to do some

2476
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:36,080
approximate measurement you usually use

2477
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,719
rdt half of the idt but it's not

2478
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,000
accurate

2479
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,400
for the uh some

2480
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,600
scenarios

2481
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:44,480
so

2482
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,400
our proposal

2483
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,719
introduces a new method to accurately

2484
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:51,199
mirror end-to-end one-way delay

2485
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:53,320
so without using the clock

2486
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:55,520
synchronization and

2487
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,560
it only uses a reference delay based on

2488
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,960
the deterministic path inside the

2489
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,480
network and

2490
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:05,679
the network latency is quite uh

2491
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:08,480
it's guaranteed and has very low jitter

2492
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,280
so

2493
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,760
as as you can see in the typical network

2494
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,360
topology we

2495
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,440
uh deploy uh

2496
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,280
uh

2497
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,360
between the sender and the receiver we

2498
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,760
have a clock offset

2499
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,719
we need to first send a reference packet

2500
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,800
from the sender to the receiver and then

2501
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,679
follow following we we want to measure

2502
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:32,239
the target packet and between the center

2503
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:34,880
and the receiver so there is a clock

2504
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,480
offset between the

2505
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,480
sender and the receiver

2506
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:39,760
and

2507
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:40,719
you know

2508
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:43,760
for the reference packet uh it is uh

2509
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,840
then through uh deterministic path so

2510
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:50,719
that it means that the uh the delay is

2511
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:52,480
uh known before

2512
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:55,679
it's based on the uh that and uh

2513
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:57,840
and the target package is what we want

2514
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,800
to marry so we just need to

2515
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,679
uh record uh the the

2516
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:06,320
send the send time the reference packet

2517
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,560
and target packet and then the

2518
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,199
similar and the arrival time and the

2519
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:14,719
timestamp of the uh both the packets

2520
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:16,480
so

2521
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:20,800
uh our calculation method as shown here

2522
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,400
is only has

2523
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,760
two equations

2524
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,400
we can uh we know that

2525
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,040
uh the the reference delay uh can be

2526
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:32,080
calculated inside the uh

2527
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,880
at the very beginning by uh

2528
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,800
at the very beginning and it won't be

2529
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:39,199
changed during the measurement and the

2530
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:41,440
offset

2531
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:45,280
the offset one and offset 2 can be seen

2532
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,119
as equal

2533
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:48,400
when we

2534
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,639
send the the reference packet and target

2535
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:51,679
passes

2536
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:54,719
uh the the interval is quite short so we

2537
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:57,199
can assume that both off test is the

2538
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:59,760
same so we can use equation one and

2539
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,360
equation two to

2540
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:04,560
uh derive to the the third quad equation

2541
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:07,199
where the target uh delay between the

2542
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:10,080
center and the receiver is determined by

2543
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:13,760
the full timestamps i recorded i at the

2544
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:17,760
both end and the delay reference delay

2545
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:20,880
so all of the five values are known

2546
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,440
so here that the target delay can be

2547
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,440
calculated so

2548
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,280
our method uh

2549
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:29,520
here are some measurement procedures i

2550
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,800
want to explain it in detail you can see

2551
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,080
in my uh draft and the the time stamp

2552
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,600
can can be also

2553
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:41,280
encapsulated in normal uh

2554
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,960
in normal format

2555
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,520
and uh and you can insert it inside that

2556
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,239
tcp header and

2557
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:50,800
between the dot and the payload and tcp

2558
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,280
header and also

2559
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,199
so um

2560
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:59,280
yeah so our uh so i want to sum up with

2561
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:02,239
my proposal so our

2562
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:05,920
mechanism don't has no need to deploy uh

2563
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,239
time discrimination so that's the

2564
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:11,360
biggest you know the um

2565
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,840
i mean the vented point of our proposal

2566
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:14,880
yeah

2567
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,920
so you can largely reduce the deployment

2568
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,440
cost of accurate one-way delay

2569
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,159
measurement compared to the current or

2570
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:24,400
state-of-the-art environment in canada

2571
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,679
so it also has no impact on intermediate

2572
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:30,560
network devices it's only

2573
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,880
you you don't need to care about the the

2574
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,040
uh intermediate

2575
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,840
network path uh just that you need to

2576
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,639
know that it you have a deterministic

2577
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:44,400
path uh between the two end and

2578
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,440
the target package might not

2579
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,840
send through the the deterministic path

2580
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:53,520
it can can be sent through some uh

2581
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,159
different path i mean between the sender

2582
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:59,119
and the receiver so you can you

2583
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:01,600
you can use the delay uh i mean

2584
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:05,840
reference delay to uh to calculate the

2585
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:08,960
the measurement path uh and the the

2586
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:11,600
target path so uh

2587
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,760
so yeah that's my uh major concern to

2588
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,639
propose it in that net

2589
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:21,360
thank you so if you are interested in my

2590
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:24,000
uh i mean my proposal you can

2591
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,600
uh

2592
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,960
talk to me um yeah yeah one also uh you

2593
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,040
are welcome drawing to our work so any

2594
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:34,320
questions i see that some um

2595
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,639
some friends are raising their hands in

2596
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:37,760
the queue

2597
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,840
so let's try to get very brief

2598
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,280
on the questions and the responses and

2599
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,639
then continue on the list uh greg thanks

2600
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:47,199
i just want to note that um

2601
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:50,560
clock synchronization uh helps uh with

2602
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,840
their uh or mitigate uh their uh

2603
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:57,679
instability of the timers so uh without

2604
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:00,639
clock synchronization

2605
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:04,320
the network of the timers might

2606
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:07,840
fluctuate differently and skew so

2607
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,239
it not be a constant

2608
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:12,320
difference between clocks and different

2609
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,360
nodes

2610
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,920
but it will be floating so that much

2611
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,840
more challenging and difficult thank you

2612
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:20,719
thanks

2613
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,320
i think in fairness to the others we

2614
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,639
have to take the questions on the list

2615
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:27,760
and give them an opportunity to to talk

2616
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:30,080
in the remaining uh 10 minutes if that's

2617
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:31,280
okay

2618
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,400
uh

2619
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:35,840
uh to dean and uh dan and uh bing

2620
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,520
yang

2621
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,719
yeah sure we can talk via chat

2622
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:42,400
chat box or you can

2623
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:46,800
send me emails uh yeah thank you

2624
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:51,040
okay we're going to try again uh if uh

2625
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:55,560
uh shampoo if you could say something

2626
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:04,239
uh he said that his local test passed

2627
01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:06,400
but we are still not hearing you

2628
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,679
um

2629
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:08,800
hello

2630
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:12,000
yes we hear you excellent

2631
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,119
uh

2632
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:15,920
you have five minutes

2633
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:21,760
oh uh so i will have to uh

2634
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:24,560
this representation quickly

2635
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,639
we

2636
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:29,360
introduced a specific solution that uh

2637
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,480
about

2638
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:34,239
uh basis forwarding next

2639
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:36,159
you have controls at the bottom of your

2640
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:39,159
screen

2641
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:47,599
so the motivations

2642
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:50,080
internet architecture defines

2643
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,520
whose goals

2644
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,840
we know that our boundary delegate

2645
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,159
abundant private law simulation bonded

2646
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,560
out of ordinary and use

2647
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,840
to resource

2648
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,719
resolution explicit diluting and

2649
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:05,040
service protection to achieve these

2650
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,440
goals uh resource resolution is the

2651
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,719
basis of

2652
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,679
insuring bonding delegita and ultimately

2653
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,840
depends on the crew mechanism

2654
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,800
of the floating plane uh the wide and

2655
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,599
use the priority basically scheme making

2656
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:21,679
whether or not it's about with worst

2657
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:23,440
case related thus

2658
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:24,800
enhancement

2659
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:29,719
scheme of before pq is proposed

2660
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,239
um

2661
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:38,560
okay

2662
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:41,199
uh this page is about the deadline clues

2663
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:44,000
the total anchors are violent of people

2664
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,440
and also

2665
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:49,119
based on our already skilled in it uh

2666
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:52,080
there are several attributes of the

2667
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,639
terminal cursor all right now gives how

2668
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:56,400
tdl attributes

2669
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,480
staggered from each other decreasing

2670
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,639
with the passage of time

2671
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:03,920
and the third night with ddr0 has the

2672
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,760
highest priority

2673
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,239
heighten the existence jiggled for all

2674
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:11,199
his priorities sub secondly zero will be

2675
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:14,239
reversed to the maximum initial

2676
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:17,119
uh the third with tdlo non-zero has a

2677
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:19,679
normal priority for end time policy and

2678
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:22,320
the proliferation and already for anthem

2679
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,480
policy the former can be involved in

2680
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,040
skilled in while the later canada and

2681
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,119
the figure the following figures a

2682
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:30,800
simple example

2683
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:31,599
of

2684
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:35,040
that code that it contains four delanaku

2685
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,679
each we see satellite attributes

2686
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:41,280
zero one two three uh after

2687
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:42,320
the

2688
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:43,440
time of

2689
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:46,000
the passage of time or for example one

2690
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,960
microseconds the tdu actually will be

2691
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,360
changed

2692
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:54,759
so next

2693
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:02,960
um

2694
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,159
okay

2695
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:08,560
so this page is about how to put pages

2696
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,800
to the

2697
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:13,280
description is mainly included booster

2698
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:15,119
but the first uh good at the denial

2699
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:18,080
information over the package including

2700
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,400
the planned terminal now the planetarium

2701
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:24,320
can be computed uh by under under delay

2702
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,960
minus the

2703
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:38,320
accumulated delay violation by one

2704
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:41,280
caused by one absolutely uh this

2705
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,280
information came together from a package

2706
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,679
itself

2707
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:49,678
second the product package

2708
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:54,519
uh the allowable skills

2709
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:00,000
plus the accumulated denomination minus

2710
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,599
the avoiding delay internode then the

2711
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:06,080
property we are putting to

2712
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,360
the

2713
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:09,760
cru with ddl attribute

2714
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,760
consistent with

2715
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:13,679
one of q

2716
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:14,960
the following

2717
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:19,040
uh figure shows a simple example

2718
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:22,840
so i will go next

2719
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:24,719
so that is

2720
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:26,480
about the traffic location and the

2721
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,840
shipping

2722
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:30,239
traffic regulation and ui board to

2723
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:31,840
ensure that the reserve abundance

2724
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:36,960
underwater of service is not exceeded

2725
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:05,520
control and world ingress

2726
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:06,960
traffic shipping

2727
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,000
is an

2728
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,280
eye port to distribute the package into

2729
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,280
the deadline

2730
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,760
the following figure shows a

2731
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,960
six part from the same deterministic

2732
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,360
service are received on the ui problem

2733
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:23,760
assuming that they arrive at the

2734
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,239
outgoing port one by one

2735
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:29,679
after internet of delay uh

2736
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:32,320
forwarding delay f each part we under

2737
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:35,440
the queue with ddl one consistent with

2738
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:38,239
a low possible delay of the target at

2739
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:39,840
least current time

2740
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:42,320
so next

2741
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:45,440
uh this page is about the benefits of

2742
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:48,879
this specific solution

2743
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,400
please

2744
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:02,159
please please try to wrap up

2745
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,119
okay

2746
01:56:05,119 --> 01:56:06,080
uh

2747
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:08,880
for the coast time synchronization is

2748
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,280
not required because network nodes

2749
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,040
operate based on

2750
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,599
relative time deployment

2751
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:17,760
a pragmatic collection base is an

2752
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:19,520
enhancement of bigger scheduling

2753
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,000
algorithm from the network upgrade each

2754
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,360
node can independently set the

2755
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:27,040
authorization time of the deadline crews

2756
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:30,080
based on several port bandwidths support

2757
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,760
partial upgrade scalability a single set

2758
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:35,920
of dynamic users support multiple levels

2759
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,119
of

2760
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:40,000
residence time performance could data

2761
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:45,119
control just a single authorization okay

2762
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,760
so for next hope we welcome any

2763
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:51,199
questions and comments thank you

2764
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,440
yeah very interesting work thank you for

2765
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,199
bringing it to the working group it'd be

2766
01:56:57,199 --> 01:56:58,880
good to see if there's comments on the

2767
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:01,119
list

2768
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:08,159
and we're on the last

2769
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:11,239
presentation

2770
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:16,799
the remainder of the time is yours

2771
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:24,560
okay

2772
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:27,520
uh thank you lou this is specification

2773
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:31,599
for that let's bend in an entity

2774
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:36,560
uh in general it is required to consider

2775
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:39,280
the vantage latency for a past selection

2776
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:42,560
to achieve the net cues

2777
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:45,119
first as per the death net controller

2778
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:48,560
play framework explicit paths should be

2779
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:51,040
calculated and established in control

2780
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:54,080
play to guarantee their deterministic

2781
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:57,199
the deterministic transmission so first

2782
01:57:57,199 --> 01:57:59,199
the end to end bend independency

2783
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:01,119
concentrates should be taken into

2784
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:03,599
consideration in past consider

2785
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:07,199
computation and second as per the

2786
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:09,679
atlantic bended lantern sea the end to

2787
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:10,400
end

2788
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:14,000
uh delay bands can be presented as the

2789
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,920
sum of a long queueing delay and the

2790
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,199
queuing delay

2791
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:20,480
along the path

2792
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,800
so the queueing mechanisms and the

2793
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,840
parameters should be determined during

2794
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:30,159
past computation so this drug disrupt

2795
01:58:30,159 --> 01:58:32,960
described the extensions to precept to

2796
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:36,000
carry bundle latency constraints and

2797
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,360
distribute deterministic passes for

2798
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:42,080
end-to-end pass computation

2799
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:45,280
in deadline surface

2800
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:48,880
so we proposed some precept extensions

2801
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,840
first uh is the metric object we

2802
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,239
proposed two liu

2803
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:57,280
types over metric object first is the

2804
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,320
end to end abandonment latency

2805
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:04,719
in the p uh the pc pcc uh indicate uh

2806
01:59:04,719 --> 01:59:08,080
carry the end-to-end validity metric uh

2807
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:11,440
to indicate um the end-to-end band in

2808
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:15,840
latency constraint in past computation

2809
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:18,239
their end to end bending jitter is the

2810
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:19,040
same

2811
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,280
with their uh

2812
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:24,880
bending their latency and second we also

2813
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:27,760
propose the iosp and extended flag tle

2814
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:31,520
we propose b bit to indicate under a

2815
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:35,840
deterministic pass capability

2816
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,599
finally we uh proposed to extend the uh

2817
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:43,679
ero and the srero to distribute the past

2818
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:46,239
computation uh we

2819
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:49,040
proposed the new information structure

2820
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:52,480
uh for example we uh proposed the death

2821
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:55,920
knight sub trv and the cycles of qre for

2822
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,199
different uh

2823
01:59:57,199 --> 02:00:00,480
viewing mechanisms

2824
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:03,599
so last step uh we

2825
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:04,639
we hope

2826
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:05,920
that later

2827
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,719
to uh determine this work could be done

2828
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:12,159
in data or pcwg

2829
02:00:12,159 --> 02:00:13,920
comments and suggestions are very

2830
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,800
welcome thank you

2831
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,960
thank you for this i would suggest

2832
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,159
bringing it to pce as well and it's

2833
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:28,719
likely that they're going to ask for

2834
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:31,360
this working group to agree that it's

2835
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,599
good work and then

2836
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:35,599
once there's general agreement that by

2837
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:37,280
the working group here that there's

2838
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:38,800
interest in it

2839
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:39,760
we can

2840
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:41,440
coordinate with the pce chairs as to

2841
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:43,920
which working group does the actual work

2842
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:46,159
uh but thank you you know this is uh new

2843
02:00:46,159 --> 02:00:47,360
work and it clearly needs to be

2844
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,960
discussed by the working group to decide

2845
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:51,440
if it's uh something that the the group

2846
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,119
is interested in

2847
02:00:53,119 --> 02:00:54,560
uh

2848
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,280
so

2849
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:56,480
thank you

2850
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:59,599
um we're we're just now at time so

2851
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:01,599
apologize to those at the end who got

2852
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:03,360
squeezed on time and appreciate you

2853
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,040
shortening things up

2854
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:05,920
um

2855
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,280
and this takes us uh uh to the end of

2856
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:12,239
the session and uh really look forward

2857
02:01:12,239 --> 02:01:14,639
to seeing everyone hopefully in person

2858
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:19,199
uh in philadelphia at the next ietf

2859
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:23,480
uh janos anything else

2860
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:27,599
nothing nothing else

2861
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:29,119
you said all

2862
02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:30,159
