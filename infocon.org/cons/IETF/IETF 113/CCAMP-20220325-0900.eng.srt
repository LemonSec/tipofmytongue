9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,480
face-to-face meeting but you know the

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120

16
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,239

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,760

18
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,560
next page

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,880
nearly

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
yeah okay

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,320
so let's start from the load where i

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,720
think this is a reminder about its idea

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,240
policies

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,720
which says that by participating in the

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,920
idf

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,560
you agree to follow idf process and the

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,840
policies

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,799
including patent policies

29
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,799
next

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,439
and then there's a piece of the

31
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,079
information about the you know conductor

32
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,439
guideline

33
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,200
the iesg

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
has asked all the chairs to

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,640
remind

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
that the working group the need for

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
appropriate behavior

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,240
uh which means that you know uh at any

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,280
at any time in any cases

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,920
we all you know i should respect

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,038
each other especially extend the respect

42
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,920
and the controversy to our colleagues

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,239
when we are you know are disgusting or

44
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,640
you know on you know debate something

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,160
next so session this time we have only

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,840
one session with two hours

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,040
next

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,319
so this agenda so this time we have you

49
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,800
know our seven presentations

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,720
actually you know most of the you know

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,360
drafts have been uh presented in the

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,239
previous meetings so i think actually we

53
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,000
should have sufficient time for

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,440
discussion

55
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,440
next

56
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,239
yeah there's some tips about this

57
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,800
meeting you know actually uh this time

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
it's a face-to-face meeting we

59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,879
so

60
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,720
usually there will be some you know

61
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,280
in-person participants but for us

62
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
there's none so actually we can skip

63
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,560
this kind of thing uh we all

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,680
we all are remote so i think you know uh

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,640
in in in the rest uh recent

66
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,319
meetings we all you know are

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,760
participating in the meeting by the

68
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,120
remote you know

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,080
echo

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
so we know how to you know participate

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400

72

next

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,959
so for the mid ankle i i think you know

74
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
one piece information is very important

75
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,680
when you are going to speak or comment

76
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,000
please you know raise your hand to end

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
the session queue

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,400
yeah next

79
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,799
and the

80
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,440
minute takers so actually we have the

81
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,239
online to us to capture the

82
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,959
minutes so if anyone could you know take

83
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,280
some help us to take the minutes

84
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,920
online that will be much appreciated and

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,640
also i ask how many to help us at least

86
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,360
and i'm not sure if oscar is here or not

87
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
actually uh oh us guys online i think

88
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,239
oscar can also uh you know help us so

89
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,560
for the blue sheets you know it will be

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
automatically created so nothing for us

91
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,720
to do yeah

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,040
next

93
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,199
ipr process you know

94
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,400
ipr policies is quite very important

95
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
so uh prior to moving to the next step

96
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,520
into one group process uh the chairs

97
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
will send out ipr polling for example

98
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
before an individual draft becomes a

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,479
working group document or a working

100
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,520
group documents goes to last call

101
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,720
we will send out ipr polling to the list

102
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,919
and so it requires other authors and

103
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,800
contributors to reply the ibr polling as

104
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
soon as possible otherwise it will delay

105
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,000
your

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,800
draft to move forward

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,120
next

108
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,440
so uh the last the

109
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,759
things about the mailing list you know

110
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,160
we always encourage people to use the

111
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,479
melodies as much as possible to discuss

112
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,720
anything about the you know uh

113
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,800
technologies inside the scope of the

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,600
work see camp working group

115
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,039
and you know

116
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,600
there's important demand one group

117
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
consensus is determined on the main list

118
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
even though we get some consensus you

119
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
know in the online conference on

120
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,080
face-to-face meeting we still need to

121
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
bring to the list you know on to

122
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,479
confirmed consensus

123
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,280
next

124
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,840

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
so let's go

127
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,080
through a little bit and update on the

128
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
working group status

129
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,800
since last meeting we don't have any new

130
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,520
rfcs or documents in the editor queue

131
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,759
uh actually

132
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,039
we

133
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,960
we have a couple of drafts which are

134
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,680
fairly needed advanced stage we have the

135
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,120
otna be on the 100 gigabits

136
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,400

137
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,560
which is waiting for the ship at the

138
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,880
right shepherd right up

139
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,600
and the oscar is is taking off that

140
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,919
because both

141
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,000
are involved in the draft

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,560
and the other one is the transport nbi

175
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,840
the client signal young model we have

176
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
minimal updates

177
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,520
let's just keep alive

178
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
uh there are stats there are still some

179
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,800
appendix pending issues uh to work on uh

180
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,720
like uh resiliency port layer etc

181
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,599
and then uh i mean that should be in in

182
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,599
a fairly good uh

183
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,840
stable status as well

184
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,160
[Music]

185
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,039
then we have the wdm interface lmp

186
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,639
uh

187
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,280
i think that a little bit of review

188
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,599
discussion is needed but also that

189
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,039
document is

190
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,280
in a pretty stable condition

191
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,440
then we have the ethernet client t

192
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,958
topology young

193
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,279
and the l1 and csm they are both

194
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,599
pretty stable documents

195
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,200
the layer one csm

196
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,279
has been updated

197
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,920
and uh

198
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,959
to fix the comments i received from the

199
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,360
young doctor review

200
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,760
i was wondering whether we should

201
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,640
ask

202
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,800
the ops working group to have a review

203
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,519
on this since all the layer 2 and layer

204
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,200
3 services

205
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,800
are in the in the operation area

206
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,040
what what do you think

207
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,399
should we

208
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,200
or maybe john if uh

209
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
if you are

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,560
if you are with us what do you think

211
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,720
should we

212
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,680
ask

213
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,959
ask them for uh for a review

214
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,959
uh i mean

215
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,880
i don't know if you already

216
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,360
read this document but

217
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
it's uh

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,480
it's a sort of uh

219
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,760
layer one version of the the service

220
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,680
models that the

221
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,839
uh

222
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,600
the operation area

223
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
has been working on the layer l2sm and

224
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,600
l3sm with the dedicated working groups

225
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,320
and l3m and l2 and m in the opsa working

226
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
group

227
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,880
yeah i haven't read them um i

228
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
i mean what what you describe makes

229
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,640
sense and

230
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,720
early reviews are never a bad idea so

231
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,519
okay

232
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,880
maybe maybe we can

233
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
okay

234
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,399
maybe we can do that as as a sort of

235
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
final check before

236
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,519
moving it forward

237
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
layer 1 types

238
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,920
this was

239
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,680
minimal

240
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
minimum

241
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,560
updates here

242
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,120
here as well as well as the otn topology

243
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,000
young

244
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,040
model these these are the two on next in

245
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,079
in the row to be

246
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,480
to go through the last call

247
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,200
otn tunnel model this is another

248
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,240
document with a dependency on the

249
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,200
uh related document in teaser

250
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,480
so that

251
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,640
the the itfte

252
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,360
uh

253
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,959
so these this is this will be unlocked

254
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,120
as uh as well

255
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,920
uh

256
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,760
we didn't hear from the authors uh

257
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,839
regarding the

258
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,720
dwdm interface parameters young model

259
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,279
that that draft expired

260
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,760
so i don't know if

261
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
any of the authors would like to say

262
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,519
something about

263
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,760
about the plans for the draft

264
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,440
if i'm not mistaken

265
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
gabrielle and gert

266
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,040
all the independent for this document

267
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
hello community

268
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
yes

269
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,000
so

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,680
we're still trying to align this

271
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,800
document with the uh with the topology

272
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,120
both in terms and also with layer zero

273
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,560
types

274
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
so we're kind of

275
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,399
waiting a little bit for that to

276
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,880
materialize and then update it

277
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,519
accordingly

278
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,560
okay

279
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,440
great

280
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,760
thanks

281
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,680
milestones

282
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,880
actually

283
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,480
uh

284
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,000
it was time to have a a refresh of the

285
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,399
milestones

286
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,920
this is

287
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,519
let me say

288
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,079
the plan

289
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
the plan forward uh you see there is a

290
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,399
pretty dense

291
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,480
number of uh deadlines uh

292
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
in

293
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
in the next month this is due to the

294
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,360
fact that we have a number of pretty

295
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,320
stable documents pretty mature documents

296
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,560
uh most of them have gone through the

297
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,200
young daughter review so we expect in

298
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,519
the next month to be ready to to to

299
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,320
progress many many documents to to the

300
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,200
law school some of them were

301
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,120
let me say capitaled

302
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,360
by

303
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,839
other documents that the

304
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,920
non-technological technic technological

305
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,320
specific ones in teas

306
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,200
now that those blocks are removed we we

307
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,680
are ready to progress

308
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
there is

309
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
quite some work to do

310
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,279
on all technologies you see microwave at

311
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,000
the end the obvious also

312
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,160
we are planning to keep the c camp

313
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,160
working group active for uh

314
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,560
for for for the next years at least

315
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
the essence and communication

316
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,079
we received the uh a communication from

317
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,760
uh from etsy

318
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,360
actually uh this was uh uh

319
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,279
sent adjusted to the

320
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,199
chairs list of these ops and camper i

321
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,040
only realized about that

322
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,360
in the last days and i forwarded it to

323
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
the

324
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
working group mailing list

325
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,040
so if you if you search for it in your

326
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,000
mailbox you will find it coming from me

327
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
and not from etsy

328
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
it's classified as communication because

329
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,959
actually the itf doesn't have a formal

330
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,040
liaison relationship with uh with etsy

331
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,320
but i mean this is uh something for uh

332
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,040
for information they are telling us uh

333
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,720
that the isg nfv uh

334
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,240
is uh uh

335
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
has started

336
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,639
a work on the wema the one

337
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,360
infrastructure manager

338
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,440
and

339
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,000
they they are planning to use the net

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,519
conference of

341
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,519
young models and base it on on ctn so

342
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,959
that's why

343
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,839
these ops working group and ccamp are

344
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,680
might be interested in this

345
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,319
communication

346
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,920
that's it any question before

347
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,079
we jump into the first presentation

348
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,099
[Music]

349
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,920
can you hear me

350
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,560
yes please sergeant

351
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
okay

352
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,199
good morning to everybody

353
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,839
i'm going to present an update

354
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,839
related to the

355
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,639
optical impairment aware topology model

356
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,040
next

357
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,639
okay so

358
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,480
from administrative point of view

359
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,759
we

360
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,759
going on to have the weekly call uh

361
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,560
on tuesday about the this

362
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,759
draft to discuss the different issue and

363
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,320
topics

364
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,199
related to the update we have

365
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,160
uh

366
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,279
done update about from text point of

367
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,000
view in the drafts and the the young

368
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
part

369
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,480
uh

370
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,839
we restructure we change the front page

371
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,079
list

372
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,519
addressing

373
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,560
the usual issue about the five

374
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,839
front page autos list and putting a

375
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,839
specific appendix

376
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,040
the other quarter list

377
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,319
and contributors

378
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,759
we

379
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,800
added

380
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
a text to

381
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,680
overcoming

382
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,279
an ambiguity present in the in the text

383
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,639
related to

384
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,560
uh what is a switching block that

385
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,439
many times is

386
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,399
called rodam

387
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,160
and the full equipped device so we

388
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,880
restructure the terminology

389
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,720
uh to clarify uh roda meaning

390
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,160
put i2t reference for that

391
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,400
and introducing

392
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,640
uh terminology uh for wdm node in the

393
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,079
related to the

394
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,919
physical device

395
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,200
and the wdmt node

396
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,080
uh

397
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,039
to distinguish the the the physical

398
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,919
device from the uh

399
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,840
tnot concept

400
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,400
uh as described

401
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,520
in uh

402
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,640
this tia topology

403
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,440
uh

404
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,600
we added text in the section 2.3 uh

405
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,960
uh

406
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,720
also this uh in the optics of uh

407
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,000
in the view to align with the uh

408
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,120
terminology uh from itu-t

409
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,080
um regarding uh

410
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,000
the introduction of uh to substitute oms

411
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and ots link with oms ots media channel

412
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,320
group

413
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,120
and the we

414
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
we we

415
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
touched the text 2.4

416
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,919
to add the description

417
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,360
uh of

418
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,840
ram

419
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,280
amplification and we added text

420
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,240
uh

421
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,000
to clarify the usage of the term channel

422
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,280
versus

423
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,880
a media channel

424
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
so the media channel

425
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,960
is described in the g807

426
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,840
as a boat

427
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,240
topology model and

428
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,559
related to the uh

429
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,640
the resource

430
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,080
in the context of our drafts we

431
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,720
use the term occasionally we use the

432
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,679
term

433
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,200
uh channel

434
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,000
uh to indicate the resource of uh

435
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,760
related to the media channel so

436
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,480
fragrance is lotto or effective

437
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
frequency slot

438
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,679
without

439
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,120
representing topology

440
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,280
from young

441
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,320
part

442
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,760
we fix

443
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,320
four basic issue and introducing the

444
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
raman amplification

445
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,919
feature

446
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,799
next please

447
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,679
so

448
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,320
this this uh picture is just to

449
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,679
represent and synthetize the changing

450
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,160
regarding the terminology

451
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,600
uh

452
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,799
we

453
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,919
for fast

454
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,600
for uh

455
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,520
we represent here

456
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
the case of integrated

457
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,320
wdm nodes

458
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,559
and we put the wdm node as represented

459
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,720
the physical device

460
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,520
and the wdmt nodes uh

461
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,840
they um

462
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,240
in the in the same way as integrated

463
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,760
in the the wdmt node

464
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,760
related to the concept of rfc8795

465
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,400
here we represented the integrated

466
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,919
architecture but the tnode

467
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,679
is working in the same way in case

468
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,240
of a disaggregated

469
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,919
architecture

470
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,640
wdm t-node

471
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,679
ex

472
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,880
hiding

473
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,039
what is the interconnection

474
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,840
between degree and a drop blocks

475
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,360
we

476
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,520
change assad the oms and ots link with

477
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,440
the oms

478
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,320
media channel group and ots media

479
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
channel group

480
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,600
and this is

481
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,600
their representation of the changing

482
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,918
next

483
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,039
one of the issue that

484
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,559
we

485
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,520
solve

486
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
is uh

487
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,280
the fact that we want

488
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,240
to use our model to describe also

489
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,360
topology where the rhodams

490
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,280
have one or multiple external shells

491
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,400
with the

492
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,600
optical transponder

493
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,520
the links

494
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,480
between the the dot

495
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,559
uh

496
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,760
hosted

497
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,640
in the in this external shelf

498
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
uh can be described

499
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,919
uh with with the tealing with optical

500
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,480
impairment as we made for the rest

501
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,960
the point is that in this case there is

502
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,440
no uh multiplexing there is not

503
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,159
and for this

504
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,400
reason even if the

505
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,520
optical impairment are the same

506
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,360
we introduce text to describe explicitly

507
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
these these points so that the

508
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,760
impairments are related to the link

509
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,159
between remote optical transponder

510
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,640
located in a different shelf

511
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
can also be modeled using the same

512
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,880
optical impairment as those defined for

513
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,880
a link between wdmt nodes so this is an

514
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,440
explicit test that is introduced in the

515
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,039
in the drafts

516
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,159
um

517
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,799
and in this case the

518
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,799
external shelf

519
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,919
can be

520
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,280
considered

521
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,400
again as a wdmt node

522
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,960
with the only difference that

523
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,840
only termination capabilities is

524
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,280
presented not switching

525
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,520
next

526
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,679
so uh as said we introduced the ramana

527
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,640
um the raman

528
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,600
feature

529
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,799
uh the

530
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,440
the raman amplifier distributed

531
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,840
amplifier

532
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,840
and we

533
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,960
modeled both the

534
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
the co-propagating

535
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,760
raman amplifier in which the optical

536
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
signal

537
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,440
is injecting in the same direction of

538
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
the amplified signal

539
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,760
and the counter propagating which the

540
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
optical pan

541
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,320
pump is injected in the

542
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,280
opposite direction of the optical signal

543
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,349
[Music]

544
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,400
from model perspective the raman

545
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,039
amplifier is a

546
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,760
model as a two

547
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,000
oms

548
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
element

549
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,720
so the a passive fiber that has to take

550
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,360
into account the fiber loss

551
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,400
and

552
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,960
an amplifier element

553
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,000
providing all the properties that we

554
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,520
have defined for amplifier

555
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,000
the amplifier element is placed

556
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,679
where the pump is located and we have

557
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:34,000
geolocation information indicate lay

558
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,919
location of the pump

559
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,520
and

560
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,559
to

561
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,799
distinguish

562
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,640
the raman amplifier from

563
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,279
it for example edfa

564
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,039
amplifier

565
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,440
we have in the model the type variety

566
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,200
attribute

567
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,400
and we introduce specific attributes to

568
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,880
model that

569
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,960
that is the

570
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,360
roman direction

571
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,080
to distinguish the co-propagating with

572
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,880
respect the counter propagating

573
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,880
case and the ram and pump with the

574
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,720
frequency

575
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,039
and the power related

576
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,679
next

577
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,240
so this is a

578
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,960
in in here is the the young model uh

579
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,559
modification

580
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,760
as we said highlighted in yellow there

581
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,679
we have uh

582
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,559
under

583
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,919
uh the same throttle of the amplifier

584
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
and in the group of

585
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,240
parameters

586
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,840
related to the

587
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,480
amplifier parameters

588
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
there are uh

589
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,440
the the the definition of the the

590
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,880
attributes that i mentioned before

591
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,640
uh we also added also uh

592
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,799
in the context of amplifier uh the

593
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,760
total uh output power

594
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,080
um

595
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,840
this is a

596
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,880
and

597
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
this

598
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,039
the total output power that

599
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,960
represent

600
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,279
the output power measure

601
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,000
uh

602
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,679
in the related range of frequency that

603
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,320
we have as attributes

604
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,480
and this is important uh

605
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,279
total the total output power

606
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,640
to uh

607
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,159
um

608
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,919
to recompute

609
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,120
the consistency between the span fiber

610
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,840
loss with respect the loss gain in the

611
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,480
elements

612
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,279
along the oms

613
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,600
link

614
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,559
next

615
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,480
okay we

616
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,799
this is another issue that we solve in

617
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,919
this period that

618
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,880
we

619
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,720
wanted to uh

620
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,640
avoid a specific specified behavior in

621
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,440
case of a mandatory attribute

622
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,640
for example

623
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,760
if

624
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,080
the survey is not present so to avoid

625
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,200
the

626
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,000
strange value that can be returned

627
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,240
because it's mandatory so something has

628
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,120
to be

629
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,919
returned but even in for optional case

630
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,240
uh we want to distinguish the case in

631
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,159
which there is a real problem for

632
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,520
example the service is not able from

633
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,399
uh

634
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,919
what uh

635
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,880
is the not applicable

636
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,159
case for example the till

637
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,399
for amplifier

638
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,159
the tilt target attributes is uh

639
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,200
is needed and has to be returned in case

640
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
of edfa

641
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,880
amplifier but is not a problem

642
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,039
in case there is not a return that

643
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,679
because does not is not applicable in

644
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,960
case of rama so are two different cases

645
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,760
and for this

646
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,039
point

647
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,360
we introduce

648
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
the type empty

649
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,399
uh

650
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,159
taking from rse

651
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,159
7951

652
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,960
and

653
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,360
we have

654
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,080
we have introduced in the module

655
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,520
uh the description that uh distinguish

656
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,000
the case that if the value of a

657
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,720
mandatory attribute is unknown it must

658
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,140
be reported using the empty type so

659
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,279
[Music]

660
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,559
in case

661
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,000
we change

662
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,720
many of the type of the attributes

663
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,760
putting the union between

664
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,600
specific type as it is now and

665
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,799
the the case of empty in case they

666
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,640
um

667
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,840
the the

668
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,640
the impossibility to return

669
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,159
uh

670
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,679
the value

671
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,799
in case of optional if it is applicable

672
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,520
as in case of mandatory it must be

673
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
reported

674
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,600
in case if this is unknown it must be

675
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,760
reported in the empty type

676
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,080
in case that the optional attribute is

677
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,960
not applicable to an entity it must be

678
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
omitted because it's not present in the

679
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,520
data store this is a sentence

680
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,840
introducing the module description

681
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,559
and

682
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,240
and uh uh next step next slide that is

683
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,919
uh

684
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,240
we have the rob uh in

685
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,919
in the queue do you have a question

686
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,559
specific to this slide that uh maybe we

687
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,559
uh sorry

688
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,520
yes i do uh so rob wilson cisco i i

689
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,919
think this is possibly over engineering

690
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,960
it so i don't quite know the cases where

691
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,679
you can't return data if this is a

692
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,679
plausible case or you're thinking just

693
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,520
like i want to

694
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,880
cover sort of

695
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,799
belt and braces and make sure cover or

696
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,200
scenarios i think it would be better

697
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,240
if the expectation is you can sometimes

698
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,919
not return this value

699
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,000
then don't make it mandatory if the

700
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
expectation is that the server should

701
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,080
always return this value if that's

702
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,679
sensible and sane

703
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,440
then mark is mandatory and if it comes

704
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,600
to the case where for some reason a

705
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,279
server is unable to return the value it

706
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,960
just doesn't give it to you so it just

707
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
doesn't send anything so

708
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,960
i'm i'm not sure

709
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,880
that this is a problem you want to solve

710
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,720
this way here because because either

711
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,640
it's a generic yang issue

712
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,039
i'm not a generic solution or

713
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,799
um or otherwise you seem to be sort of

714
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,559
engineering a very specific

715
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,159
way around this i'm not sure that that's

716
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,640
a good choice

717
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,720
is this something that is already been

718
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,760
discussed uh in uh

719
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,480
in net mode

720
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,799
not not recently that i can think of um

721
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,720
it did come up in the discussion to the

722
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,919
nmda architecture where the there's text

723
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,679
in that that effectively says that the

724
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,679
server is allowed to not return

725
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,240
data in these sort of scenarios and the

726
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,399
one case that is interesting

727
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,080
is if you have telemetry and your stream

728
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,799
telemetry off the box then if you don't

729
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,519
send a value then you have a case where

730
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,360
you don't know it's you got no value or

731
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,399
just the

732
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,840
receivers expected to have the previous

733
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,440
value received

734
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,600
um so i but i think this would be worth

735
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,840
raising as a more general question on

736
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,360
the netmod alias to see what the

737
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,480
comments are

738
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,399
on this idea

739
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,039
yeah a good

740
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,080
observation the point is that uh okay we

741
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,679
we have also

742
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,559
uh

743
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,880
people that is working with us and we

744
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,159
have in parallel already someone that is

745
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,320
implementing that and

746
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,200
so

747
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,880
the fact to have a strange value that is

748
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,240
coming back

749
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,679
uh in case value is not known

750
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,279
it was a problem during the

751
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,640
implementation so we try to solve

752
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
in parallel of the description of the

753
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,279
drafts also the problem that is coming

754
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,320
from that we say the the experimental

755
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,200
field

756
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,480
and so

757
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,440
this was apparently a good solution

758
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,039
i mean

759
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,000
i bet it is but uh i mean as rob said

760
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,679
that this is something that needs to be

761
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,600
solved in a more uh

762
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,120
general way

763
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,600
probably not in c camp maybe net mode

764
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,760
yeah

765
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,919
what i'm saying is that in the meantime

766
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:46,720
what

767
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,519
uh we need to have some solution for

768
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,039
that this is the point

769
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,039
well if you if you raise it in the net

770
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,960
mod alias and discuss it hopefully

771
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,559
that'll come to a conclusion fairly

772
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,799
quickly as to what it is and if this is

773
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,320
the deemed to be the right way of doing

774
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,919
this that's great then we we find that

775
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,679
we do it consistently but

776
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,600
i think you'd find that this like the

777
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,679
young doctor have used this document and

778
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,200
that this would come up as being an

779
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,480
unusual way of modeling this

780
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,240
yeah

781
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,480
we can raise we can raise the question

782
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,360
as a working group if you prefer or i

783
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,919
mean since most of you are active

784
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,840
participants in that mode if you wanted

785
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,080
to do it yourself as you prefer if you

786
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
believe that raising the question as a

787
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,679
working group

788
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,840
is uh is better we can do that

789
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,559
otherwise uh i mean

790
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,840
you can

791
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,240
you can uh bring

792
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,559
the the the question to the working to

793
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,360
the working group to the to network

794
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,840
and ask to have it solved in a generic

795
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,760
way as you prefer let us know if you

796
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,679
want us to

797
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,679
address the issue

798
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,919
there is italo in in queue

799
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,120
yeah

800
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,080
please

801
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,279
thank you

802
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,320
on this point uh i agree though to to to

803
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,399
raise this question to net modern to get

804
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,399
some advice from them and just to

805
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,719
qualify a bit the reason why this was

806
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,839
requested

807
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,679
uh if you if you don't report an

808
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,960
attribute there was an interest for the

809
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,119
client to know whether the attribute is

810
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,359
missing because it has not to be

811
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,000
reported for that specific configuration

812
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,399
or it is missing because for some

813
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,520
reasons it's not available it's unknown

814
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,199
and that's the reason why we had these

815
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,079
uh this different not reporting at all

816
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,399
it doesn't give this this capability to

817
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,839
notify the client

818
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,800
but i

819
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,960
we can clarify this question to the net

820
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,918
mode and get their advice

821
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,320
yes well probably it will make it more

822
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,800
efficient rather to say

823
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,639
this is the problem and we started to

824
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,159
solve it in this way

825
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,760
and we we believe that this is the way

826
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,839
to solve it rather than just saying hey

827
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,359
we have a problem and please solve it

828
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,839
and just one other thought on that is

829
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,359
again i didn't quite pick up the nuance

830
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,359
of the different sort of not reporting

831
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,040
the values you're saying there but it

832
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,880
may be that you would be better off if

833
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,560
you need to get that extra distinction

834
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,480
in there to have an enumeration as your

835
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,079
second union type and then you could

836
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,000
have enumerated value that's more clear

837
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,200
as to to what it means to return

838
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,720
that rather than returning null like

839
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,320
returning empty is quite strange thing

840
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,800
to return operationally

841
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,119
okay

842
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,520
next

843
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,480
okay here is uh

844
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,760
the example how is uh we

845
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
introduced the

846
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,160
uh modification so

847
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,400
for example we have uh

848
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,200
uh uh created uh

849
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,320
uh the the the list of type def in layer

850
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,400
zero type extension

851
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,200
uh

852
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
i don't know like for example type def

853
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,400
power in db or null

854
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,760
and in this case we have uh the junior

855
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,880
uh union uh

856
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,000
between the power in db and and then the

857
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,440
eptic case

858
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,560
and in parallel we have changed uh

859
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
a lot of attributes

860
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,359
uh putting the union instead of the

861
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,400
single time this is what

862
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,040
we have done

863
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,480
okay next

864
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,119
okay as usual we track

865
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,119
tracking open issue in this link

866
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,280
and we

867
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,240
closed

868
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,760
9 issue

869
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,920
since the last itf

870
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,079
we have still 11

871
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,960
open issue um

872
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,839
well

873
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,720
we have

874
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,640
11 but uh

875
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,960
there are uh some issue to this for

876
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,920
uh in the first ballot that

877
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,400
we already know how to

878
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,320
solve that and so

879
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,480
i will be solved with the next pull

880
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,920
request

881
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,160
because i already discussed and agreed

882
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,240
they

883
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,119
the the the issue 88

884
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,720
uh they

885
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,640
have been already discussed and we just

886
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,440
waiting for tax proposal but

887
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,400
also this has been clarified

888
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,520
um

889
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,720
they issue 79 that is related to the

890
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,880
expat in life ref

891
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,960
and here we need the

892
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,079
clarification from net mode we have a

893
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,440
specific

894
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,839
um

895
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,880
uh presentation today for this

896
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,079
point

897
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,440
um

898
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,480
we

899
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,320
need to review terminology and

900
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,720
and that they are

901
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,400
young model development approaches

902
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,760
so not

903
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
let me say

904
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,960
directly involve both text and

905
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,079
the young part

906
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,839
next

907
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:22,640
so

908
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,960
we consider that the model is in very

909
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,680
good shape

910
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,440
we

911
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,960
are analyzing possible leading enactment

912
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,000
covering a new feature but

913
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,119
the the model is already in a very good

914
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,440
shape

915
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,200
at the we need to address the remaining

916
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
issue

917
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,079
and

918
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,359
i think

919
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,240
we can be ready for a young doctor

920
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,720
review

921
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,800
and we

922
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,320
plan to have a stable version by the end

923
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,160
of the year so

924
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,240
from itf

925
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,240
115.

926
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,599
that's all for my site any question the

927
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,400
way you enjoy your your work it's a very

928
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,160
good shape that's just good

929
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,040
so

930
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,320
you're satisfied with that

931
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,880
any question while i pull up the next

932
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,880
slides

933
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,040
we can move on

934
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,079
okay uh good morning again i'm sergio

935
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,680
belotti again

936
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,359
so this is uh

937
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,359
the uh

938
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,160
new draft that is uh

939
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,800
the restructure of the layer zero type

940
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,640
extension draft

941
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,599
uh

942
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,680
with the uh

943
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,800
the new name of

944
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,200
1993 bs

945
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,400
next slide

946
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,880
okay

947
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,640
so

948
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
this document

949
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,960
is uh obsolating the rfc 1993

950
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,920
uh

951
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,000
um

952
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,280
encompassing uh the content of rfc 1993

953
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,040
with the content player zero type

954
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
extension

955
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,560
um

956
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,599
we

957
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,319
we are following for this restructure of

958
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,920
the document

959
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,800
uh the comment that we received

960
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,400
at the itf 412th

961
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,720
and and with the the last pull request

962
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,119
we restructured the document

963
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,800
uh to become

964
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,119
the the new one rfc 1993b

965
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,400
um for the mod the update

966
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,359
uh we added also the layer zero

967
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,800
technology specific constraint issue uh

968
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,280
related to the issue certified

969
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,680
uh so we added the gsnr merging ngsnr

970
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,240
estimated

971
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,440
that our

972
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,839
output of part computation this is

973
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,440
coming from

974
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,000
the analysis made in the optical path

975
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,400
computation drafts

976
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,800
next please

977
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,160
okay this is the young structure for the

978
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,760
new uh

979
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,040
grouping

980
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,160
um

981
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,760
so we we introduce up as i said the gsn

982
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,280
are merging

983
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,920
as input of the part computation in the

984
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,359
part constraint

985
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,800
and we added the estimated gsnr as

986
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,640
output of the path computation

987
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,839
next

988
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,119
uh we added

989
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,560
more line coding identities

990
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,520
so there was a comment

991
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,800
during uh

992
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,440
in the optical impairments that

993
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,839
we do not address

994
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,880
the

995
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,839
gross

996
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,520
bit rate

997
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,400
so we

998
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,280
we

999
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,400
what we we've done to uh

1000
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,359
address this issue 100 in optical

1001
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,960
impairments

1002
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,400
is to introduce a new uh leaf

1003
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,880
that is just for bit rate

1004
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,880
um

1005
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,520
that is

1006
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,960
to to indicate

1007
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,280
the gross bit rate like 100 200 300

1008
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,079
for optical tributary signal

1009
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,640
but we still exploit

1010
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,079
uh atlanta bitrate uh

1011
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,280
leaf

1012
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,720
uh in case of standard reference when

1013
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,280
there is not just the bit rate that is

1014
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,000
uh

1015
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,720
needed but for example also modulation

1016
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,480
format because

1017
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,920
for definition of line coding

1018
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,240
in itu-t line coding is more than the

1019
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,040
line bitrate is just representing other

1020
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,040
attributes

1021
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,720
next

1022
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,079
okay here is the modification we have

1023
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,400
done related to the issue 99 we

1024
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,119
discussed before in optical impairment

1025
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,119
for the empty

1026
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,240
in case

1027
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,000
we do not get

1028
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,119
um

1029
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,640
value

1030
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,319
in in

1031
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,160
some cases

1032
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,440
so we introduce new type def

1033
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,640
for that

1034
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,839
and

1035
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,520
update

1036
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,359
types

1037
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,480
in optical impairments and the layer

1038
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,319
zero type extension in some grouping

1039
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,800
with the new type empty

1040
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,240
uh and with the union between the value

1041
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,400
the the the former type and the new type

1042
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,800
empty

1043
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,359
next

1044
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,280
so next step for these uh um

1045
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,720
these drafts uh so we need this we still

1046
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,280
need the in the structure of the the of

1047
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,560
the the two documents so the the rfc

1048
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,920
1993 and the layer zero type extension

1049
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,440
we need to reconcile the introduction

1050
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,400
so the introduction coming from rfc with

1051
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,160
the new one

1052
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,880
from the layer zero type extension

1053
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,800
we need to complete the uh appendix a

1054
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,280
because we need to report the changing

1055
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,560
uh from rfc 1993

1056
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,400
and we plan to to to to fix

1057
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,839
the remaining issue

1058
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,880
this is that's all for my site

1059
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,280
thank you

1060
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,400
any questions

1061
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,839
so actually here

1062
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:22,960
uh

1063
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,839
i mean

1064
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,720
his is uh uh we thought it was a good

1065
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
idea to have the lease with respect to

1066
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,880
rfc 1993

1067
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,839
um

1068
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,560
i don't know i've seen other working

1069
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,720
groups having the same issue issue and

1070
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,800
solving it in a different way

1071
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,480
for example recently

1072
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,839
i've seen a draft i don't remember which

1073
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:46,880
one where

1074
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,599
the authors were requested to just uh

1075
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,319
write a small draft with an update

1076
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,079
so uh

1077
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,240
i don't know

1078
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,359
so sorry john for bothering you again i

1079
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,240
know it's pretty early for you but

1080
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,000
can you please confirm that the bc is

1081
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,319
the right way to go here

1082
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,359
or

1083
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,839
do you prefer an update like they are

1084
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,560
doing in this

1085
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,040
i i apologize i was distracted to say

1086
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,800
the question again

1087
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,920
so this is uh uh

1088
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,599
we we recently published rfc 1993.

1089
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,040
this is a

1090
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,079
an update to that one we are adding some

1091
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,280
parameters some concepts that we removed

1092
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,160
in order to have 1993 published

1093
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:34,880
uh

1094
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,119
pretty uh pretty fast

1095
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:37,920
uh

1096
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,119
i've seen two different ways of solving

1097
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,680
this issue the one is to go for abyss

1098
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,160
and the other one is to write a small

1099
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,800
draft with just an update

1100
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,079
um

1101
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,240
i've seen in the past that the visa was

1102
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,760
the most uh

1103
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,280
widely adopted

1104
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,079
uh solution here i just wanted to have a

1105
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,400
confirmation uh from you that this is

1106
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,240
the right way forward

1107
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,079
or uh if

1108
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,520
okay perfect

1109
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,079
yeah i i get the question now yeah so i

1110
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,200
mean

1111
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,560
right you're absolutely right you could

1112
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,000
do it either way um i

1113
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,680
personally like the abyss better because

1114
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,119
then it keeps all the material in one

1115
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,280
document

1116
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,599
that's exactly the way we we would the

1117
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,160
reason why we chose to go for that okay

1118
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,400
thanks robert

1119
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,240
uh yes just echo what john's saying i

1120
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,000
think if you're completely replacing the

1121
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,760
yang model before then doing abyss and

1122
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,839
obsoleting the previous one is the best

1123
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,680
way great thanks

1124
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,919
bye

1125
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,800
last two you know i kept meeting there

1126
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,559
were lots of the discussion on this

1127
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,520
issue and there was a consensus that the

1128
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,839
working group preferred to

1129
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,119
publish you know a kind of sfc

1130
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,400
yeah so i agree with john

1131
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,119
good

1132
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,319
we are ready for the next presentation

1133
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:12,800
oh

1134
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,040
voice check can you hear me

1135
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,359
yes perfectly

1136
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,359
okay thank you

1137
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,680
so today i'm um this is iowa from

1138
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,480
futurewii and i'm presenting this

1139
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,079
slides for the framework and data model

1140
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,640
for otn slicing on behalf of other

1141
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,680
coasters and contributors

1142
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,319
next page

1143
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,200
okay so here's a

1144
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,559
brief updates of the draft since

1145
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,319
the last etf um we have this draft it

1146
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,960
was a working group adopted

1147
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,680
and we have had inter meeting and

1148
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,680
discussions on the mailing list

1149
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,880
about

1150
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,359
how this uh draft will be moving forward

1151
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,720
um the github repository was also

1152
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,640
transferred to c camp

1153
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,960
uh with all the records and and meeting

1154
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,839
minutes uh in there um so i would

1155
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,640
encourage everyone to come to the to the

1156
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
github and check it out

1157
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,400
we also have a weekly uh call on every

1158
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
thursday um

1159
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,079
on the um on the mean side and for this

1160
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,280
revision the main update is on the draft

1161
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,319
text

1162
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,960
to address comments and consensus from

1163
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,599
the

1164
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,480
um from the discussions

1165
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,880
we have done a lot of work

1166
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,640
with

1167
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,680
alignment with relevant to drafts which

1168
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,680
includes the

1169
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,559
t's network slicing framework

1170
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,359
the

1171
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,319
network slicing young model

1172
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,119
and

1173
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,400
the applicability for ictn on

1174
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,800
netflix slicing

1175
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,760
as well as um the model um

1176
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,720
uh the in the interview draft on uh

1177
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
defining the model

1178
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,240
um

1179
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,079
network slice

1180
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,559
structure

1181
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,000
next the page

1182
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,160
so here we um like to present some

1183
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,160
conclusions on

1184
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,920
the discussions um on um the way we move

1185
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,079
forward with ltn slicing

1186
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,040
so first um first of all there was a

1187
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,599
very good summary from

1188
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,960
keys on the framework for ietf network

1189
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,240
slices thanks to adrian

1190
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,280
in which the two relevant

1191
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,319
points

1192
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,520
to the otn slicing is first of all the

1193
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,240
scope for ietf network slice must

1194
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,119
include any use of uh

1195
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,280
must

1196
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,800
basically is applicable to uh any

1197
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,800
uh scenarios uh beyond the 5g

1198
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,760
and

1199
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,559
second is the interest for ietf network

1200
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,640
slice is to cover

1201
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,800
the mapping of ietf network site

1202
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,920
services

1203
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,200
to any

1204
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,960
ietf network which includes not just ip

1205
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,760
but

1206
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,280
otn and

1207
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,720
any

1208
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,280
technology specific layers

1209
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,319
which

1210
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,839
then supports our conclusions below

1211
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,240
which says

1212
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,960
the technology specific slicing for otn

1213
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
is in scope

1214
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,000
and

1215
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,960
also the use cases for otn

1216
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,480
justifies the need for slicing in otn

1217
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,960
networks

1218
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,400
and we also uh see uh the conclusion

1219
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,599
that uh

1220
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,319
this the use of slice and otn slicing um

1221
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,760
there are proper

1222
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,200
terms for otn um as long as they are in

1223
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,640
the context of ietf network slicing

1224
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,559
and uh an otn slice uh in

1225
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,680
in this case is in

1226
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,319
indeed an ietf network slice when the

1227
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,558
ietf network is otn

1228
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,800
and the otn slice controller

1229
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,839
in the context of itf network sizing is

1230
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:28,800
a

1231
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,119
is considered as an itf net slice

1232
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,400
realizer

1233
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,040
for otn

1234
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,400
and we um oh i'm sorry i i haven't

1235
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,319
finished the last one yeah so there are

1236
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,880
three other bullets just say

1237
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,160
for example layer one vpn t topology and

1238
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,480
t tunnels can be considered as a

1239
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,160
realization of an otn slice

1240
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,599
and also we briefly touched

1241
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,720
the discussion on whether otn slice mbi

1242
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,359
is a top-down

1243
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,839
is used as a top-down

1244
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,200
configuration

1245
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:05,920
or

1246
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,079
bottom-up and the conclusion is it is

1247
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,119
an intent interface which can be used as

1248
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,599
a top-down configuration to uh to

1249
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,240
configure an otn slice

1250
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,760
uh the uh it is also agreed that the otn

1251
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,200
slice mpi uh it should augment uh the

1252
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,319
ietf and nsdnbi

1253
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,240
next page

1254
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,559
yeah so here are the main text updates

1255
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,839
uh so we added uh descriptions uh for

1256
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,359
the three options of configuring nltn

1257
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,319
slice

1258
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,880
as i will show on the next page

1259
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,000
and

1260
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,079
we also added a

1261
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,480
text to clarify

1262
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,359
the relationship between otn slice

1263
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,400
intent and its realization

1264
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,880
which is which can be used uh can be

1265
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,240
realized by any uh existing means as

1266
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,040
shown on the previous page

1267
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,119
we added text

1268
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,400
to

1269
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,440
clarify that otn slice control mpi is

1270
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,800
technology

1271
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,520
specific and augments the ietf network

1272
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,200
size mbi

1273
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,640
there are also

1274
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,400
some minor

1275
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,720
changes um on the format of the document

1276
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,440
and also we address the tom's comments

1277
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,520
in the mailing list

1278
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,280
um there are

1279
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,480
with with other cosmetic updates

1280
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,359
next page

1281
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,799
so here's a an updated diagram on the

1282
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,599
right side and in which we uh clearly

1283
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,640
marked the three different options as

1284
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,960
there can be

1285
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,520
uh uh used to create an otn slice uh

1286
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,960
with option one being the uh ietf

1287
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,359
network slice controller directly

1288
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:02,799
interface with

1289
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,119
the pnc

1290
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,880
um and in this case uh no tns slice

1291
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,880
controller is used

1292
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,400
um and

1293
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,640
in option two an itf network size

1294
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,319
controller could

1295
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,880
interface with an otn slice controller

1296
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,559
and and

1297
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,240
delegate the

1298
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,040
the

1299
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,839
creation of an otn slice to the otn

1300
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,400
slice controller

1301
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,040
and then in addition we have a third

1302
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,160
option

1303
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,760
for any uh technology specific

1304
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,760
for any otn aware

1305
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,680
customer uh as

1306
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,920
for example an otn

1307
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,480
oss or dss

1308
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,000
to interface with an otn slice condola

1309
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,720
to create a technology-specific slice in

1310
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,000
the in the otn domain

1311
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,119
next page

1312
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,200
there is a

1313
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,559
very little

1314
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,599
young model updates in this revision

1315
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,720
and just to to format uh just on the

1316
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,880
formatting to conform with the young

1317
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,640
guidelines

1318
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,440
and we plan to make uh additional

1319
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,480
updates uh once we clarify

1320
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,000
the way moving forward with otn slicing

1321
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,720
next to page

1322
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,119
we also did

1323
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,960
some discussion on

1324
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,960
harmonizing with the

1325
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,040
network slides and via yeah

1326
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,839
as

1327
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:32,960
yeah as

1328
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,599
i think i already uh said we agreed for

1329
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,720
the otn slice young otn slice control

1330
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,520
mpi model to augment the network slice

1331
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,880
mbi model from my from tees

1332
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,559
we are currently

1333
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,400
analyzing the model structures um and

1334
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,440
for the network slice mbi

1335
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,559
moves just specifically we are checking

1336
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,440
whether the network slice mpi contains

1337
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,599
all the required parameters for otn

1338
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,119
slicing

1339
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,319
and whether

1340
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,119
which parameters are technology agnostic

1341
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,079
which could be technology specific

1342
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:10,880
for

1343
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,599
ip etc

1344
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,280
and uh whether we

1345
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,319
whether the base model uh the network

1346
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,200
size mbi can support uh resource-based

1347
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,400
slicing

1348
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,359
um

1349
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,079
with topologies but if not

1350
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,000
we will be adding

1351
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,760
this support in the otn slicing

1352
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,079
model

1353
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,720
next page

1354
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,000
yeah um

1355
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,640
we are also harmonizing with another

1356
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,760
draft the tease applicability

1357
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,880
of

1358
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,359
actin on slicing um and we have agreed

1359
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:54,960
for the

1360
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,040
author of that draft

1361
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,119
to

1362
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,119
give an update on the figure which

1363
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,760
describes the mapping of ietf network

1364
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,119
slice controller to the sctn mdsc in

1365
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,559
order to

1366
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,319
clarify the interfaces used in this

1367
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,440
in this

1368
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,280
mapping

1369
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,200
the the main thoughts towards that

1370
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,319
change is that we have an mdsc which

1371
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,720
could consist of

1372
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,440
a service orchestrator as well as a

1373
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,520
network orchestrator

1374
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,079
and in that respect the ietf and sc mbi

1375
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,680
uh

1376
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,880
slash otn sl otns mbi

1377
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,520
uh is uh equivalent to uh

1378
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,160
an interface between the mdc service

1379
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,200
orchestrator and network orchestrator

1380
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,160
and there's

1381
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,720
there's currently no uh official name

1382
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,799
for that but i

1383
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,520
i think we will leave for the

1384
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,440
author of that drafted to

1385
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,599
clarify

1386
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,079
next page

1387
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,880
so the next steps for this draft is uh

1388
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,920
to uh we will continue uh to address the

1389
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,400
comments from the working group

1390
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,599
and uh we'll

1391
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,319
start the work to align and augment ietf

1392
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,880
network slice yang

1393
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,000
and

1394
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,680
we will

1395
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,559
add otn technology specific definitions

1396
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,359
such as slos and

1397
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,160
other parameters according to the next

1398
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,559
discussions yeah

1399
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,760
i think that's it

1400
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,240
any questions uh comments more than

1401
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,599
welcome

1402
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,839
thank you

1403
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,680
i have one

1404
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,119
um

1405
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,480
oh fertile you go first

1406
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,079
so uh it seems that the ego is not in

1407
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,319
the conference call and which makes your

1408
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:03,520
life easier but anyway i would like to

1409
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,880
check

1410
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,960
if all of the you know open issues

1411
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,359
raised by your ego have been addressed

1412
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:15,240
or are there any open issues left

1413
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,480
i think that the

1414
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,760
main issue

1415
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,880
raised by igor on whether it's

1416
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,599
necessary to have otn slicing i think it

1417
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,640
has been addressed

1418
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,599
and have has been concluded as shown in

1419
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,640
the slides there are there are a few uh

1420
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,440
other

1421
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,640
uh

1422
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,040
questions about uh

1423
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,200
about uh uh

1424
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,480
slicing but i think it's it's uh

1425
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,680
not otn uh specific it's uh it's a

1426
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,440
slicing uh in general right um that can

1427
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,680
be uh addressed by teeth um so for that

1428
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,000
for example one other question is

1429
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,720
whether like a slice could support just

1430
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,559
a p2p

1431
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,760
or uh like uh it could support the p2p

1432
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,480
p2 p2 mp or mp2mp

1433
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,240
it has to support all of them in order

1434
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,480
to consider to be considered as a as a

1435
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,920
slicing service

1436
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,040
uh i think those kind of questions are

1437
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,040
really relevant to network slicing in

1438
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:24,400
general and can be done in teas yeah

1439
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,640
okay thank you

1440
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,599
yes in fact i mean adrian was presenting

1441
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,799
the other thing the other day

1442
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,480
and

1443
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,960
he was asking if

1444
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,240
there were questions coming from c camp

1445
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,160
that the states needed to be addressed

1446
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,119
but

1447
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,920
uh i think that with the discussion that

1448
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,400
we had on that is meeting list we should

1449
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,079
consider uh

1450
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,240
all these issues the more or less solved

1451
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,799
if there is any anything else left to

1452
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,319
discuss

1453
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,839
uh

1454
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,880
let's let's put together a list of the

1455
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
um

1456
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,839
issues still still open right

1457
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,720
good

1458
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,240
next

1459
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,640
one

1460
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,720
is

1461
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,720
done

1462
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,359
hi guys morning um danielle you can

1463
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,599
delegate uh the controls to me i can

1464
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,799
click a button on your behalf

1465
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:34,200
of course

1466
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,480
so hi good morning uh we wanted to

1467
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,599
provide a quick update on

1468
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,640
uh two documents uh the the flexigrid

1469
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,200
dug document one was the topology the

1470
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,680
other is the tunnel

1471
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,440
and also just raise uh some

1472
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,880
issue that we've actually been having

1473
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,559
that not only affects these two

1474
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,039
documents but also affects uh other ccap

1475
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,440
and also tease documents in the way that

1476
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,160
we use augmentations and uh when

1477
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,079
statements

1478
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,839
so danielle i don't don't have the

1479
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,359
ability to

1480
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,240
advance the slides

1481
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:18,160
yeah i think it's it's quite technical

1482
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,400
i think that only works if you're

1483
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,640
projecting pdf that's been uploaded and

1484
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,599
this looks like it's coming from uh

1485
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,760
uncooked powerpoint on daniel's

1486
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,440
just uh

1487
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,440
i was doing them for you oh thank you

1488
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,319
sir

1489
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,920
great so uh this the this document uh

1490
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,559
has been uh relatively finished it's

1491
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,280
stable uh we had

1492
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,359
various comments that we needed to

1493
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:46,319
address

1494
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,039
after the last call so thank you tom and

1495
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,400
adrian

1496
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,000
for that

1497
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,319
we really kind of just had to resolve

1498
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,359
the issue with um the augmentations that

1499
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,119
that that's that that was the main issue

1500
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,280
with the document and that's really why

1501
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,400
uh why the document was slightly delayed

1502
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,200
uh and i will i will cover that uh with

1503
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,599
some slides uh a little later but for

1504
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:11,599
all intents and purposes

1505
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,400
the topology document flexigrid is is

1506
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,760
now finished

1507
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,760
and if the working group

1508
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,480
is happy with our solution

1509
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,200
for the augmentations then we will

1510
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,640
proceed with this document and submit it

1511
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,520
next slide please

1512
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,799
so the um the tunnel documents oh there

1513
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,280
is a slight typo there just to see if

1514
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,720
anyone's paying attention still we

1515
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,240
actually changed it from media channel

1516
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,440
to to tunnel but essentially this is a

1517
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,920
document which isn't as mature as the

1518
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,839
flexigrid topology document there's

1519
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,039
there's still

1520
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:48,400
quite a bit of work

1521
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,920
that needs to be done with the document

1522
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,119
the code itself is is relatively stable

1523
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,760
but there has been some uh dependencies

1524
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,200
with other documents uh there's also

1525
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,839
uh some specific sort of technical uh

1526
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:05,520
discussions required for things like

1527
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,000
the way the tunnel is used and

1528
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,079
dependencies

1529
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,200
or associations with the ots ig

1530
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,520
specifically the tunnel identifiers and

1531
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,559
and

1532
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,960
path set up so there's also

1533
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,000
some

1534
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
further sort of ancillary work that's

1535
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,599
happening with the path computation

1536
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,920
document as well so we we just expect

1537
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,000
this document to have multiple issues

1538
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,599
that are going to be

1539
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,960
discussed uh as you probably remember we

1540
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,839
have a

1541
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:37,200
uh a weekly call for the

1542
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,440
flexigrid documents the focus is now

1543
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,960
really on the tunnel document itself

1544
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,559
but we've we've also uh moved the path

1545
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,640
computation discussion into our

1546
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,960
flexiwood calls so when you see the

1547
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,520
invites uh for the flexigrid discussion

1548
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,760
i should really sort of add um our sort

1549
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,960
of um optical path computation um uh

1550
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,920
topic to that as well and those calls

1551
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,760
have been postponed

1552
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,280
just prior to and during ietf 113 but

1553
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,119
those will restart after 113.

1554
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:14,000
next slide please

1555
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,000
in fact danielle could you go on to the

1556
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,359
next slide now i'll skip this one

1557
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,559
so what was the issue that affected the

1558
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,520
topology document and you know i think

1559
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,839
here we need to kind of highlight

1560
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,640
um the great work that our our young

1561
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,599
doctors do when they review the anco

1562
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,640
there is uh obviously a lot of

1563
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,720
technology specific

1564
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,960
content um that they have to kind of

1565
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,000
pass

1566
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,480
and for c c-camp and tease we have a

1567
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,799
tendency to use with our yang models um

1568
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:54,640
at numerous augmentations um often

1569
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,760
numbering

1570
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,119
sort of tens

1571
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,599
as many as 50 and one document

1572
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,280
i looked at over 100 augmentations

1573
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,200
and i suppose that's just the kind of

1574
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,720
the nature of the technology that we're

1575
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,160
dealing with most of these are

1576
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,799
controlled via when statements

1577
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,240
and when we

1578
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,000
when we have the when statement sort of

1579
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,760
highlighted in blue there i'm moving my

1580
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,839
mouse but but you can't see that

1581
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,640
um but essentially on the graphic there

1582
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,880
uh we also have to

1583
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,079
um sort of test um for the presence of

1584
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,079
the container in the network type and

1585
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,319
there's usually multiple

1586
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,000
levels as well

1587
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,319
could be just some four levels could be

1588
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,079
sort of ten levels

1589
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,480
um and because the augmentation takes

1590
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,359
place at different levels um we use the

1591
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:44,160
relative form of the xpath statement so

1592
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,640
it's very important that

1593
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,440
those dot dot dashes are actually at the

1594
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,880
right level

1595
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,119
and you can see i think on the right of

1596
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,880
that slide

1597
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,119
all the yellow uh

1598
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,599
horizontal dots are essentially where we

1599
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,119
use those when statements and that

1600
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,119
that's just one single document which is

1601
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,680
our probably our topology document and

1602
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,839
it's not as numerous that that when

1603
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:10,079
function is not as numerous as other t's

1604
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,880
and c caps documents

1605
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,119
so that's that's a lot of work that

1606
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,759
needs to be done not not obviously by

1607
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:19,600
just the young doctor but anyone who's

1608
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,080
actually a human who's

1609
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,600
sort of reading through or passing this

1610
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,560
document

1611
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,080
uh next slide please

1612
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,719
so there's good news uh actually uh

1613
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:34,640
there is a function um it's a x or an

1614
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,679
axis or a

1615
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,238
uh and it uses this thing called an

1616
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:43,198
ancestor function so instead of

1617
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,880
having to

1618
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,759
um sort of use a when statements and

1619
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:50,960
specify um the

1620
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,198
the relative location

1621
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:56,399
um um that you're augmenting you can

1622
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,960
just specify uh the ancestor state

1623
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,120
statement instead of using that relative

1624
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,000
path

1625
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and that makes things

1626
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,279
a lot easier for humans who are reading

1627
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:10,399
or reviewing uh this document and again

1628
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,080
not just the young doctors but but

1629
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,158
anyone the vendors or

1630
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,520
potential

1631
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,319
users of this technology

1632
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,319
so this is um this is a cool feature and

1633
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:25,120
we started using it extensively um in

1634
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,880
our documents

1635
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,759
and uh next slide please

1636
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,000
we hit an issue

1637
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,479
when we started uploading uh our our new

1638
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,399
uh internet drafts

1639
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,000
through the submissions tool

1640
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,198
because it turns out it breaks um one of

1641
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,839
the tests that is performed so the the

1642
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,799
yangling test is actually something that

1643
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,479
happens when you when you upload your

1644
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,479
document or you can use it

1645
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:53,920
to sort of test

1646
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,360
code before you

1647
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,640
submit

1648
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,679
and this we thought would be maybe just

1649
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,400
a

1650
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,760
a minor issue um we kind of flagged it

1651
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,640
to the experts in netmod

1652
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,440
and we got a kind of mixed response

1653
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,600
because uh there were

1654
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,000
several people in network that thought

1655
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,960
well um it's a legitimate use of um yang

1656
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,199
it may be sort of esoteric

1657
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,840
as in sort of fairly specialized but

1658
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,480
that shouldn't deter us from using this

1659
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,840
function

1660
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,920
there were other people um who thought

1661
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,560
that actually um

1662
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,800
we we probably

1663
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,120
might be

1664
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,800
um i guess

1665
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,000
what's the word yeah um suggested that

1666
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,199
uh we should not use this uh feature

1667
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,360
because it was not well understood and

1668
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,440
clearly not all the tools actually

1669
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,679
support this ancestor function

1670
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:53,840
we should revert back

1671
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,120
to our sort of um uh

1672
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,600
relative um path

1673
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,400
uh

1674
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,719
when using the augmentation uh the when

1675
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,880
statement for augmentation

1676
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,440
so we are kind of you know we we we

1677
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,360
bounced sort of backwards and forwards

1678
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,520
uh for about a month um just really

1679
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,239
trying to figure out what to do here um

1680
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,760
ultimately from an implementation

1681
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,600
perspective when it's you're read by

1682
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,280
machine it's it's not a major issue

1683
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,120
but considering

1684
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,080
you we we do expect more young models in

1685
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,080
the future and there are

1686
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,159
sort of i suppose

1687
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,280
not just

1688
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,000
impacts here for c-cam but also teas

1689
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,480
it it would be worth kind of widening

1690
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,960
the discussion beyond the flexi grid

1691
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,480
folks to see what

1692
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,159
what other people thought

1693
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:43,600
of this

1694
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,920
for the time being we've reverted back

1695
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,920
to our previous code base as mentioned

1696
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,440
so we're no longer using the ancestor

1697
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,360
function which is a shame

1698
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,679
um but that's where we are now because

1699
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,360
we just wanted to move ahead with the

1700
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,759
document

1701
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,440
and that's that's it so i'd just like to

1702
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,520
open up to the chairs and and the rest

1703
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,000
of the working group

1704
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
robert

1705
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,679
sorry i didn't realize i put my hand up

1706
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:16,880
and then the

1707
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,840
me taker wasn't quite working uh yes i i

1708
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,440
actually think here

1709
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,480
um my personal preferences um

1710
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,800
if it if the existing one works then

1711
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,400
that's going to give you the widest sort

1712
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,679
of um

1713
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,199
deployability most tools are going to

1714
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,560
work with that whereas if you try and do

1715
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,199
the sort of clever thing even though

1716
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,920
technically it might be allowed i would

1717
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,600
suggest you you're more likely to hit

1718
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,360
tooling issues in future i think if we

1719
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,719
want to

1720
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:44,239
um

1721
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,239
support this i suggest this goes on like

1722
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,880
the yang next issue tracker and he's

1723
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,159
more explicitly thought about in the

1724
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:51,920
context of an updated version of yang

1725
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,199
would be my view on this um i think you

1726
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:56,880
that keeping it simple even though

1727
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,159
you've got the longer expressions is

1728
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,159
probably the best way that's just my my

1729
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,719
personal opinion

1730
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,360
i was about to say exactly the opposite

1731
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,480
so

1732
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,920
let's

1733
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,560
let's do what rob suggests

1734
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,400
i mean

1735
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,920
my mighty clear is that i mean since if

1736
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,440
it was

1737
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,520
a document that we needed to publish

1738
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,040
tomorrow

1739
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,719
i would i would suggest to revert

1740
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,719
absolutely

1741
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,800
but i mean since there are still many

1742
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,040
things to be done

1743
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,920
i think we can wait and see if uh other

1744
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,239
working groups are embracing uh

1745
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:40,000
uh this this functionality and the tools

1746
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,920
we get uh uh upgraded accordingly

1747
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,679
john please please

1748
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:48,080
yeah i was i actually put myself in line

1749
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,800
to say almost the same thing um

1750
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,239
you did which is

1751
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:53,760
yeah if we need to ship it right away

1752
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,000
then do the pragmatic thing but if we

1753
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,480
you know can afford to to take our time

1754
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,440
then

1755
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,920
i mean it sounds from rob's comment and

1756
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,679
rob i'd be interested in your

1757
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,760
you know

1758
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,679
read back if i'm understanding you right

1759
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:08,640
that

1760
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,760
um

1761
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,520
this isn't thought to be like we're

1762
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,920
using it wrong it's just that we're you

1763
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,679
know sort of pushing the envelope on the

1764
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,360
tooling and

1765
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,120
um so

1766
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,719
as long as our timeline allows the

1767
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,960
tooling to catch up that

1768
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,719
i would think ought to be okay

1769
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,800
um uh so rob

1770
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,159
so i think i need to look a bit more

1771
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,239
closely exactly what's being used here

1772
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:35,520
is xpath in its use in its usage of in

1773
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,480
yang um the sort of some bits of x bar

1774
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,320
that they want and some bits of x path

1775
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,480
you just get because it's x-path and in

1776
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,880
terms of the implementations i suspect a

1777
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,199
lot of them just do the basic

1778
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,760
i want a path into the tree type thing

1779
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,239
and don't do the more complicated

1780
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,640
um stuff of of actually allowing

1781
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,000
different sorts of ancestors and

1782
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:56,960
searches and things like that because

1783
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,800
you can write these sort of um more

1784
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,040
concise x-path expressions but it's just

1785
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,679
more likely um that tooling that should

1786
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:05,440
handle this just won't because they just

1787
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,360
do the basic things so that's my concern

1788
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,480
is that

1789
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,480
um i'm not sure whether they will be

1790
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,040
running um a generic xpath

1791
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,360
parser might also be i'll have a look

1792
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,600
the other thing is to see what um the

1793
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,520
yang author guideline says because they

1794
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,920
may well also have some recommendations

1795
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,040
here i think there's some text about

1796
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,719
that i can check that

1797
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,719
but um i don't mind you trying it but i

1798
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:27,840
think it's definitely worth having a

1799
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,360
wide discussion

1800
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,719
first before we ship something with this

1801
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,640
because it you may just be you're making

1802
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,960
your lives harder and and the people who

1803
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,239
who use this life's hard as well

1804
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,840
okay i mean that's that's great feedback

1805
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,480
guys um and we i think we totally agree

1806
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,120
with you that this isn't sort of a

1807
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,600
burning um

1808
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,920
issue for us right now um we can

1809
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,000
continue um with the document obviously

1810
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,679
there are other documents that are sort

1811
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,760
of complementary to this anyway

1812
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,920
we will highlight this i guess with some

1813
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,080
of the other um

1814
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,920
document authors uh in in teas

1815
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,080
and uh follow up again with the guys in

1816
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,080
that mod and just you know see where we

1817
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,440
are in another month or so

1818
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,840
yes thank you um

1819
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,840
yeah

1820
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,840
when we do my understanding is from the

1821
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,719
manual discussion from the

1822
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:29,760
rsc8407 is that

1823
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,560
it is a legitimate use on chestnut the

1824
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,480
problem is that if the tool does not

1825
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,199
support it there will be a roadblock

1826
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,199
to the adoption by the market of our

1827
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,520
module and that's why my suggestion is

1828
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,320
to

1829
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,120
to go with a relative partner and in the

1830
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,560
future if and

1831
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,280
become supportive we can always take it

1832
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,600
use it because it is much better from

1833
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,280
the right new reading but

1834
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,040
if the tool is not supporting it then we

1835
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,880
have a good one more than nobody

1836
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,280
implements which is not good to me

1837
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,440
thank you

1838
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,239
what i wanted to say

1839
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:17,679
great

1840
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,320
sorry to close with you but

1841
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:24,480
we needed to rush a little bit

1842
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:29,400
optical computation

1843
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,159
okay can you hear me

1844
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,120
hello hello

1845
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,360
okay i'm good okay sorry hi everybody

1846
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,199
i'm with hello from norway i'm

1847
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,520
presenting uh

1848
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,440
an updated version of the optical

1849
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,679
computation rafter next high please i

1850
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:56,560
cannot

1851
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,159
move

1852
01:17:58,159 --> 01:17:59,679
okay

1853
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,360
what is the status okay initial version

1854
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,040
of this rap is representing the last

1855
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,719
type of meeting

1856
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:07,199
and it is a quite a straightforward work

1857
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,280
at this moment in time because what we

1858
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,640
are doing here we are basically

1859
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,840
augmenting

1860
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,679
the deep compute motion mode which is

1861
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:14,880
generic

1862
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,080
with uh

1863
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,320
technology specific informations and we

1864
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,719
are using the common definition from the

1865
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,000
lfc 1993 beast and from layer one type

1866
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,360
and and the what we do like the the

1867
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,360
generic is in alignment with all the

1868
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,360
work which is ongoing on ut and doubles

1869
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,600
and reflexively internal models

1870
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,600
and as mentioned by daniel we are

1871
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,000
discussing any issues on the draft in

1872
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,600
the weekly code together with the

1873
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,560
flexibility topology and tunnel models

1874
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,800
next slide

1875
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,159
what we changed from the previous

1876
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,760
version we added the ayana

1877
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,280
considerations

1878
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,040
and we'd added some acknowledgements

1879
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,679
because an initial version of zone flex

1880
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:56,239
will be the computation

1881
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,960
model has been taken out from the from

1882
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,280
the from the from their drafts and we

1883
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,880
put acknowledgement to sal to their

1884
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,600
authors for the initial work or to the

1885
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,080
authors of those we didn't join this

1886
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,679
traffic document

1887
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,679
we didn't do any change on the otm pack

1888
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,840
of rotation and the reason for that is

1889
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,280
is because of the internal model is

1890
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,679
quite stable and we are already aligned

1891
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,280
so as a consequence of sodium power

1892
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,199
computation is quite stable

1893
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,840
we did a major changes on the double

1894
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,679
zone and flexibility computation based

1895
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,199
on the weekly call discussion and in

1896
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:28,320
particular

1897
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,480
uh the changes has been reflected in the

1898
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,960
llc 1993 bs only a zero part constraint

1899
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,679
is properties and we are using them

1900
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,480
to

1901
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,199
con configure the gsnr margin and report

1902
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,960
the estimated json r in the

1903
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,640
computational response

1904
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,120
next slide

1905
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,000
okay

1906
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,239
one open issues since the last meeting

1907
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,400
is again how many modules there are many

1908
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,400
documents at this moment we have one

1909
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,600
document

1910
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,280
with the three modules

1911
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,600
and we we see that the otm pack rotation

1912
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,000
is quite uh are related to the other

1913
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,640
documents toyota modules sorry while

1914
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,800
that doesn't complexity computation has

1915
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,199
a lot of commonalities among themselves

1916
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:10,400
especially because all the otsi related

1917
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,159
the configuration is independent from

1918
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,040
whether the grid is fixed or flexible

1919
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,360
while the label specific information

1920
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,560
which is related to the grid

1921
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,239
configuration is different between

1922
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,960
amazon and flexigrid and we are using

1923
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,600
the types in the c93bs

1924
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,639
actually 1993 which are common between

1925
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:31,199
the computation and doubles and topology

1926
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,920
models so the the doubts that we have is

1927
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,440
what do we do here

1928
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,520
and we had some discussion in the last

1929
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,719
few days among quotas and our proposal

1930
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:44,000
as as quarters is maybe we can have

1931
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,760
one document we can split into two

1932
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,760
documents in one document we develop the

1933
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,679
otm computation which is quite

1934
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,159
independent from the other one and also

1935
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,159
has a different maturity level and in

1936
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:57,040
the second document we we try to put

1937
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,159
together into one module as well the w

1938
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,920
zone and flexibility computation

1939
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,719
configuration modules into one we need

1940
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:07,120
to understand how to reconcile the issue

1941
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,360
with the label configuration but we can

1942
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,440
exploit this option and see what are the

1943
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,760
whether it is technically feasible

1944
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,560
so this will be the proposal and next

1945
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,560
next slide

1946
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,320
so the next steps is to address any

1947
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,719
comments and feedbacks we receive

1948
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,639
we can complete the document with the

1949
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:26,320
security manageability considerations

1950
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,280
which are currently empty and we keep

1951
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,199
alignment with the discussion on going

1952
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,800
with the relative tunnel models because

1953
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,560
the path constraints and path properties

1954
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,840
are the same

1955
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,199
and we

1956
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:41,600
we want to finalize the module doc the

1957
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,840
modules document as structure and we had

1958
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,880
the proposal uh discussed before and we

1959
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,400
think the document is really for the

1960
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,960
adoption of uh working group and if you

1961
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,960
split into documents both documents will

1962
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,880
be ready for adoption

1963
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,840
thank you

1964
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,600
oh man please

1965
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,239
hear me

1966
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,560
uh i'm trying to ask a question for

1967
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,520
participation on the modern dependency

1968
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,080
it looks we mentioned the layer zero and

1969
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,639
there one types will be uh

1970
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:23,679
would be

1971
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,000
no this work depends on the zero and one

1972
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,280
type and is there any other models uh

1973
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,239
this work depends on

1974
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,280
it depends also on the itf computation

1975
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,360
and i don't i will double check i don't

1976
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,800
remember any other dependency

1977
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,760
okay

1978
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,440
my personal

1979
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,520
opinion is

1980
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,199
the number of

1981
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,520
documents

1982
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,679
should be

1983
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,560
only increased if the dependency is

1984
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,840
different

1985
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,199
so so

1986
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,199
that means maybe

1987
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:00,880
we can have one for

1988
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,440
layer one and the other one for layer

1989
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,679
zero but in the document actually you

1990
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:09,440
can have multiple models as you like

1991
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,560
i agree i mean uh

1992
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,600
probably merging uh w7

1993
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,520
would be it could be a good idea i mean

1994
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,600
in this in the end

1995
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,199
the obvious one can be considered the

1996
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:27,040
top case of flexibility

1997
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:32,840
keeping layers in layer 1 separator

1998
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,159
is uh he is a good idea as well because

1999
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:37,600
i mean uh

2000
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,679
we have different uh

2001
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:43,520
implementations that uh only care about

2002
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,320
the optical and only care about the

2003
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,639
piano so keeping the documents separate

2004
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,320
there is

2005
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,040
is a good idea as well but i mean this

2006
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,440
is just

2007
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,520
let me say

2008
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,320
a reflection

2009
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,639
i i'm open to

2010
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:04,800
whatever the working group

2011
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,960
believes is that is the best idea

2012
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:15,239
any other opinion here

2013
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,480
okay if not we can move

2014
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,520
to this

2015
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,239
to the next slot

2016
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,239
okay hello

2017
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,760
hello

2018
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,639
please thank you

2019
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:45,520
hello everyone i'm chad from huawei i'm

2020
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,760
glad to do this presentation on behalf

2021
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,320
of all the contributors

2022
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:53,520
of jobs is room with our hard way in

2023
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,199
when we manage and provide a young model

2024
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,679
which can be used in the northbound of

2025
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,760
the network before

2026
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,880
okay this next page

2027
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,000
our job first presented in last item

2028
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,560
meeting both in ecamp and

2029
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,239
ups awg

2030
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:15,520
and

2031
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,000
we got some valuables

2032
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,960
in particular we suggested to target the

2033
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,000
brothers

2034
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,280
and find a technology agnostic community

2035
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,120
so at first we remove the optical

2036
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,920
constraint and draft name and idle

2037
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,360
and based on the feedback from ops hwg

2038
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,960
discussion we have analyzed um

2039
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,320
to inventory relative job in opsawg and

2040
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,960
we have found no overlap

2041
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,000
if we have clarified that

2042
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,199
this job is for hardware inventory

2043
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:55,719
management on narrow scale

2044
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:59,360
we also replaced the minority of shelf

2045
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,920
with chases because chase is is a more

2046
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,560
recognized technology agnostic term

2047
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,840
another major update is that we have

2048
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,760
presented a big issue in in the draft

2049
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,560
that this this issue may lower

2050
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,719
integration efficiency

2051
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,560
between systems

2052
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,840
okay business page

2053
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:28,239
in the current model proposal uh most of

2054
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:31,679
the object just like chases slot sub

2055
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:32,880
slot

2056
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,280
etc are defined as

2057
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,560
never elements component and they are

2058
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,239
distinguished by their class

2059
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,360
in real network scan scenario if the

2060
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,679
output system want to do a full

2061
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:49,280
synchronization

2062
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,120
we can now retrieve all the network

2063
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,679
elements including the their components

2064
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:56,320
and one request because no system can

2065
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,840
bear so

2066
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,199
such huge amount of data

2067
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:03,360
and the number of each component time in

2068
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,600
in one network element

2069
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,120
is not certain

2070
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:10,960
so so that it is hard to use pagination

2071
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,120
so one possible way is that the network

2072
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:17,199
controller provides retrieving

2073
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:21,599
data from network animals one by one

2074
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,000
and secondly

2075
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,880
in currently relational database

2076
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,360
implementation are commonly used in ict

2077
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,560
industry

2078
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,679
and for different in one to object they

2079
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,800
are safe in different tables both in the

2080
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,760
network controller and the other system

2081
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,199
so when doing the full synchronization

2082
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,600
uh the network controller

2083
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,639
shall combine component objects together

2084
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,480
according to this

2085
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,840
modal structure

2086
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,880
while the upper system

2087
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,239
needs to cross classify and and so them

2088
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:00,239
into different group

2089
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:03,520
this combination and sorting progress

2090
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,239
is inefficient

2091
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,719
even if the time consumed from one

2092
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:11,040
narrow element is not too much

2093
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,440
but it increased by

2094
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,159
increased linearly with the number of

2095
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:17,679
network elements

2096
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,600
and could become hours with 10

2097
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,560
thousand

2098
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,600
never ends game network

2099
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,480
okay next page please

2100
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:34,080
and this slide provides some detail on

2101
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,440
the workflow

2102
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,639
when doing the full synchronization

2103
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:40,000
in the first step

2104
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,719
the client can collapse some other

2105
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,360
inventory object uh which are not

2106
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,600
defined under the network element

2107
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,880
for example equipment room and racks

2108
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,639
and then the kind can start to

2109
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:53,760
synchronize

2110
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,560
the

2111
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,880
network elements data and

2112
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,120
and the components underlay but before

2113
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,440
that you need need to retrieve the

2114
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,960
identifier

2115
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,360
of all the network elements

2116
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,000
but this step but don't take too much

2117
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,080
time

2118
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,880
okay next page

2119
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,440
and then the kind

2120
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,400
will retrieve the components of each uh

2121
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,480
network element one by one

2122
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:24,639
when the server receive the request and

2123
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,360
internally it will query is a different

2124
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,239
table to construct this

2125
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,679
response

2126
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:35,679
the chases the slot the border the pause

2127
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:37,760
should be combined together

2128
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,040
to a single component list

2129
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,239
the client receive these

2130
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:46,400
component lease response it cannot

2131
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,639
recognize them quickly

2132
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:51,280
and and they need to solve them by the

2133
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,679
class attributes one by one

2134
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,040
these two steps step 18 and step

2135
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,840
19 are time consuming

2136
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,639
and could lead to an efficiency issue in

2137
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:06,000
large scale network

2138
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,920
this in efficiency issue has also been

2139
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,560
found with other young data model

2140
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,840
integration and a mayor have been sent

2141
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,520
to sikham

2142
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,560
this and nemo mailing list to gather

2143
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:25,040
more feedback and from the wider group

2144
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:28,159
okay next page please

2145
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,199
as a summary

2146
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:34,880
the draft has been updated to clarify

2147
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,040
its scope and describe the possible

2148
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,120
efficiency issue with

2149
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,960
with the current model

2150
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,560
and for the next

2151
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,840
next step

2152
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,199
we believe that

2153
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,199
more discussion in

2154
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:48,639
camp

2155
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:51,040
net mode and this working group is

2156
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,320
required

2157
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,560
then we can determine the final model

2158
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,600
structure

2159
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,560
in parallel we will analyze more use

2160
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,840
cases

2161
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,480
considering other technologies

2162
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,159
and we think that

2163
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:05,600
the job

2164
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,400
is ready for working group adduction and

2165
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,960
the technical issue can be addressed

2166
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,840
through normal working group progress

2167
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,639
process

2168
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,639
also in contributed have a weekly

2169
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:19,600
meeting

2170
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,480
every so here i make some mistakes uh

2171
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,080
every wednesday

2172
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,080
from 10 a.m to 11 a.m uh in american

2173
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,520
central

2174
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,360
standard time

2175
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:34,400
anyone who is in uh interested with uh

2176
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,440
invented uh inventory is welcome to join

2177
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,520
this call just let us know

2178
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,719
okay

2179
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:42,880
the discussion minute and most of the

2180
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,639
information can also be found in the

2181
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:45,760
github

2182
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,840
repository

2183
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,840
that's all for my presentation thank you

2184
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,080
thanks to you

2185
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,440
i i i'll start with the questions so

2186
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:03,040
during uh during the week at the uh

2187
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,360
routing area meeting uh

2188
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,800
we were requested uh to report on work

2189
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,639
that might need

2190
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:13,040
coordination with other working groups

2191
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,800
and we

2192
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:17,040
brought up protein lighting where we

2193
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,400
already have

2194
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,480
a pretty good interaction with the

2195
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,600
teaser

2196
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,600
and this is one of the other

2197
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,760
topics that we brought up

2198
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,440
i didn't remember

2199
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,400
that

2200
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,120
you already had the the the draft

2201
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,960
presented in opsa

2202
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,960
working group that is extremely good

2203
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,040
so if

2204
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,719
they are uh happy to have the draft

2205
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:45,520
uh

2206
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,800
being progressed as it is in c camp

2207
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,320
uh i think that we can uh

2208
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,679
we

2209
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:56,719
we we can make we can make a poll

2210
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:58,560
is my understanding that correct that

2211
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,800
the obstacle working group is is happy

2212
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,800
to have that the work being done in sea

2213
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,040
camp

2214
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,440
yes

2215
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:11,199
in last meeting uh

2216
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:15,760
for opsawg they suggest uh us to

2217
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,360
run these

2218
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,960
drafts in c camp

2219
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,280
and and we also

2220
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,080
discussed in sikkim last meeting and we

2221
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,920
agreed to

2222
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,159
stay in uh

2223
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:31,760
in sikkem working group okay

2224
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,000
okay

2225
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:38,159
you were in the queue with your theater

2226
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:41,360
okay then rob

2227
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:42,960
hi

2228
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,480
sorry um robinson i've not been able to

2229
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,960
review this but i do think that with the

2230
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,800
overlap with

2231
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,199
um maybe the entity yang model that's

2232
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:55,040
there today somewhere maybe this is a

2233
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,719
network wide one i basically need to

2234
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:58,639
review this it may be that this might be

2235
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,000
better to do

2236
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,920
um in the ops area

2237
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,679
um rather than see cam i just want to

2238
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,679
understand what the scope of this

2239
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:07,920
document is i want to make sure that we

2240
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,040
get

2241
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,520
sufficient reviews across the right

2242
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,840
areas to make sure that we don't

2243
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,400
we're not standardizing

2244
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,000
a very generic thing within this working

2245
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,040
group and start getting sufficient

2246
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,639
reviews so i think that's the key thing

2247
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:22,880
to me is make sure we get those reviews

2248
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,560
they're not saying it can't be done here

2249
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,960
but that's one one aspect the other the

2250
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,639
other comment on uh in terms of the

2251
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:29,920
structure

2252
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,360
uh again i haven't actually reviewed the

2253
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,159
documents so it's hard to comment but um

2254
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,080
in terms of flexible models it's worth

2255
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,159
looking at the open config platforms

2256
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:40,880
yang model um because they have a way of

2257
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,960
um being quite generic and flattening a

2258
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,880
tree-like structure down into a list

2259
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,920
with parent and and sub uh parent

2260
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,719
subcomponent or children pointers

2261
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,080
um that allows you to have fairly

2262
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,440
generic structures and still have the

2263
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,400
data so i think that that approach may

2264
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,480
possibly work here or it's worth looking

2265
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:01,480
at

2266
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,119
okay thank you

2267
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:04,159
uh

2268
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:06,400
for the first question uh

2269
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,840
actually we are open for uh the weather

2270
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:13,920
to run this job in in uh c camp and uh

2271
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,159
opposite wg and if

2272
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,280
uh

2273
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:20,320
if you consider that uh our analyze on

2274
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,400
the old lab

2275
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,719
is not sufficient or maybe

2276
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,040
we still need to do some work and maybe

2277
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:30,000
we can have a check

2278
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,199
through email after this meeting okay

2279
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,280
and for the

2280
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,119
second question about the

2281
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:37,390
uh

2282
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:38,960
[Music]

2283
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:42,320
trick structure integration and and if

2284
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,679
there is a

2285
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:44,800
uh

2286
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,080
is a lot of

2287
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,639
uh a lot of level and there's a

2288
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:51,440
the tree is very deep and

2289
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,080
we think that they did

2290
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,520
they could be

2291
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,239
uh could be issue when do they doing the

2292
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,800
integration and i also send the email in

2293
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,000
there

2294
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,239
uh seeking working group and maybe you

2295
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,159
can you can have a look and then we can

2296
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:07,760
have a further

2297
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,840
discussion okay thank you

2298
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,719
he could easily

2299
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:16,800
so sorry i was just saying that it could

2300
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,159
easily be that the the the draft might

2301
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,560
end up being split into two parts one of

2302
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,239
which is a generic and will be

2303
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,400
progressed in in the opposite working

2304
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,840
group and there

2305
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,159
might be a more specific one that we can

2306
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,159
take in second that

2307
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:35,040
that's a a fairly

2308
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,520
uh viable option as well

2309
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,800
yeah

2310
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,400
yeah let's just say it's just trying to

2311
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,159
find the reviews get the right reviews

2312
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:43,600
i'm not that

2313
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,199
concerned about where the document's

2314
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:46,719
done it's just making sure we get the

2315
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:48,719
right comments and things uh if you drop

2316
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:50,800
me an email then um then i can they

2317
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,159
follow the discussion on that side and

2318
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:54,080
also i can give you a point in terms of

2319
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,520
the structure but i need to review this

2320
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,600
anyway okay thank you

2321
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,400
thank you okay thank you

2322
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:06,880
in a good order to come right after

2323
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,600
robert yeah

2324
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,840
yeah actually i agree with danielle

2325
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,880
saying that the ops awg expert is

2326
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,199
feeding back saying that this model is

2327
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:20,000
quite close to the hardware inventory

2328
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,159
when it looks

2329
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,400
well currently the term inventory is a

2330
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,400
little bit uh

2331
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,239
misused or overused in the ops awg and

2332
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:31,679
the same terminal having different

2333
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,199
meaning

2334
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:36,080
so it it would be extremely useful to

2335
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,480
clarify the quote for each inventory

2336
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,800
related work and

2337
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,440
the expert some of the experts fit that

2338
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,400
with us this is more closer to the

2339
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,920
hardware inventory and it's okay to run

2340
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,360
in either side

2341
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,920
and regarding the kind of generic units

2342
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,520
and

2343
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,400
the technology specific features from

2344
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,679
the hardware inventories and

2345
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,840
we do think there are

2346
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,199
a

2347
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:08,480
quite high percentage of molarity

2348
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,239
and that means

2349
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,880
if we only stand

2350
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,719
if we only stand from the perspective of

2351
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:16,880
optical there may not be very much

2352
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,400
technology

2353
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,119
specific augmentation

2354
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:24,799
like we did in the pauldron tunnel

2355
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:30,239
are you up

2356
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:31,760
it's just some quick comments on the

2357
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,080
scalability problem uh because this

2358
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,440
model is used at the mbi open a

2359
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,840
controller which interfaces with the

2360
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,639
mini network nodes right

2361
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:45,840
so if we uh try to get all the inventory

2362
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,760
data from all the nodes in the in the

2363
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,239
network uh it's the data is going to be

2364
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:51,760
huge and that's where the the

2365
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,400
scalability problem is coming from

2366
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:58,480
whereas the open config model um

2367
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,920
it's a single network element so the

2368
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,960
data is not as much as what we would

2369
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,760
deal with in a from a controller

2370
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:10,960
perspective

2371
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,040
and when we have discussed this issue in

2372
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:16,000
our weekly uh meetings and um i i mean

2373
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,239
would be rather interesting to

2374
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:20,080
what the community

2375
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,320
is dealing with

2376
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,840
that level of

2377
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:25,920
data um

2378
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,840
and how they deal with this philippines

2379
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:32,159
because certainly our goal is to uh not

2380
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:34,320
not interfere with the beta model

2381
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,520
structure a big just because there's

2382
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,480
the

2383
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:39,840
scalability

2384
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,440
problem

2385
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,520
i think it would rather we need to have

2386
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,080
find a generic way of dealing with that

2387
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,400
problem

2388
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:52,800
thank you

2389
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,440
thank you

2390
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,679
uh the folks working on this product

2391
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:58,960
should really have a look at the open

2392
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,719
conference

2393
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:03,360
point about uh i don't really understand

2394
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,800
whether there's really a

2395
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,440
lot of ability issue but uh yeah i think

2396
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,239
this should be considered

2397
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,440
okay

2398
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:22,400
uh

2399
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,840
okay you're still in the queue

2400
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,880
i think we can move to the next slot we

2401
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,960
have 20 minutes left for two

2402
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,840
presentations so 10 minutes each

2403
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,119
has

2404
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:37,759
as planned

2405
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,040
the

2406
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,159
next presenter please

2407
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:46,880
thank you chairman campaigning

2408
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,119
yes

2409

presently

2411
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:57,600
and we have to call this from

2412
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,480

2414
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,280
this jobs provide some continuation

2415
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,280
requirements with

2416
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,199
existence in the draft

2417
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:14,480
and also it provides some configuring

2418
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,400
registrations the first group and the

2419

flexi the

2440

or group

2446
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,960
there are several jobs talking about

2447
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,199
flexi frame controls

2448
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:28,400
and configuration models

2449
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,679
currently using the proxy computer model

2450
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,000
draft

2451
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
get a good catch of previous discussions

2452
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,280
about flux modeling and gives a basic

2453
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,440
effect c configuration model

2454
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,239
that's a good start point to put forward

2455
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:48,000
the flexi modeling

2456
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,040
thank you next page

2457
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:56,719
based on the standards and the drops

2458
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:59,920
mentioned and some discussion in the

2459
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,280
mail list

2460
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,679
convergence requirements are summarized

2461
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:06,000
into three categories

2462
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,239
uh here you can see flex group reflects

2463
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:10,719
calendar from the first client

2464
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:13,600
for the flight scope it includes such

2465
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,080
requirement as configuring the

2466
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,080
device google play wireframe

2467
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,880
configuration and

2468
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,159
if inconsistency exists notifications to

2469
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:26,239
be invoked

2470
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:29,040
for the flux current

2471
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,600
the requirements include configuration

2472
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:34,320
updating the usage state of canada

2473
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:37,280
source and verification

2474
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,520
for flex client

2475
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,320
the requirement include assign calendar

2476
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,520
slots

2477
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:47,199
adding or removing files clients into or

2478
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:49,760
from the price group

2479
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,080
next page

2480
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,639
this figure shows an example

2481
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,440
configuration including a flux group

2482
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:02,320
between the flux multiplexing node and

2483
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:06,080
the flux steam of the ultimate flux node

2484
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:06,880
which

2485
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,080
with four

2486
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,800
100d files bonded together

2487
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,719
and two

2488
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:15,760
flex clients occurred over this first

2489
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,000
group

2490
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:21,360
the flux group should be configured

2491
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:24,480
before the flank flex client and the

2492
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,840
initial configuration commands could be

2493
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,719
from external monumental system or sdm

2494
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:32,560
controller

2495
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,560
the flex con the flex configuration

2496
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,960
model shows the natural parameters about

2497
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,280
flex group and the flexor client

2498
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,199
listed the model for

2499
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:46,000
could be used for further augments or

2500
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,760
extension

2501
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,000
speed

2502
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:53,600
okay

2503
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:54,639

2504
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:56,719
the right part

some of the data nodes

2509
01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:11,920
are described and explains

2510
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,920
where they come from

2511
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,639
when will be configured for a state

2512
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:19,119

we'll

2536
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,880
update the draft according to the work

2537
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,880
group fetchbox

2538
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,840
and to propose merge this dropped into

2539
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,719
the plus configured model draft

2540
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:39,440
and i hope the merged draft would be

2541
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,440
adopted as work group

2542
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,440
drop in netflix

2543
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,839
thank you

2544
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:51,759
rob please

2545
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,840
hi robinson um yes thank you for this um

2546
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,159
i think it's i know that the record was

2547
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:00,000
trying to work on flexi previously and

2548
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,600
then that work sort of got stopped and

2549
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:02,960
so i'm really pleased to see this coming

2550
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,560
back i think it's great

2551
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,719
um for you to work on a model in this

2552
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:08,800
area and to get that done so so that i'm

2553
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:11,119
really pleased with um i sort of agree

2554
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:13,040
also agree that merging these two drafts

2555
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,159
together the one that's talking about

2556
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:15,840
applicability the actual yang model that

2557
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,560
makes sense to me um often you sort of

2558
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,880
see um examples of how to use the ammos

2559
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,199
in the appendix um so that's a good

2560
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:25,040
thing to do one comment i've got in

2561
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,480
terms of this the current structure the

2562
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:27,840
model this is probably more on the other

2563
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,159
draft than this one is i questioned a

2564
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:32,239
bit about having the flexi client

2565
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:33,679
configuration

2566
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,400
under the client interface rather than

2567
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:39,920
having it under the sort of flex e

2568
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,639
container that you've got on on slide

2569
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:44,880
five so it's about side five and seven

2570
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,119
and my reasoning for that is that the

2571
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:49,679
flexi client configuration isn't really

2572
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:52,880
so much about the client interface as in

2573
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,679
everything else you would normally

2574
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:54,960
expect to be on there but it's actually

2575
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,480
related to how

2576
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,199
the flexi interfaces are set up so if

2577
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:01,440
you look at for example a time slot list

2578
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,600
that list isn't sort of independent of

2579
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,760
each client interface you need to make

2580
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,080
sure that the time slots you're using

2581
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,360
are

2582
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,040
sort of organized with the other client

2583
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:14,239
interfaces under the same flexi

2584
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:16,000
as a group interface

2585
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,600
um so that was that's one comment i have

2586
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,440
i don't think this is a

2587
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,280
like a must-have change they have to

2588
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:22,880
make but i think it would make the model

2589
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,719
a bit more consistent in my mind so that

2590
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:26,560
would be my recommendation but i've also

2591
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,239
provided that to the authors directly

2592
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:30,560
when they when i review this

2593
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:33,800
thank you

2594
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,679
how is this a flexi drafter related to

2595
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:47,199
the draft of one sick second flexi young

2596
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:49,679
configuration model 0-2

2597
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:51,920
i

2598
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:53,600
if

2599
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,400
if you wanted to answer

2600
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:07,280
what is the relationship the

2601
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,960
relationship between the two drafts

2602
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,199
uh

2603
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:15,040
uh

2604
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,560
in this

2605
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,639
in this draft we

2606
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:22,560
do the example based on the first

2607
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,360
computer model the first draft

2608
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:29,040
and also we summarize some requirements

2609
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,400
i think that's

2610
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,320
that part

2611
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:37,199
did not exist in the first product

2612
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,320
i mean i i agree will drop one thing

2613
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:43,199
that these two drafts seem to be

2614
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:45,599
perfectly fitting together and merge

2615
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:47,679
into a single one

2616
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:51,679
uh i i only have one question uh i mean

2617
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:54,719
i i will i'm seeking for confirmation

2618
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,560
from you

2619
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:59,360
there was another draft

2620
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,840
another configuration model

2621
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,280
draft

2622
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,960
a while back

2623
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,320
that

2624
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,119
was left to expire that seemed to be

2625
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,480
competing

2626
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,800
with the configuration model not with

2627
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,719
the one that you just presented but more

2628
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:17,679
with the configuration model

2629
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:19,520
i don't know how

2630
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:20,239
the

2631
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:21,599
um

2632
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:23,760
let me say the competition was assault

2633
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,800
it was just that the other one was left

2634
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:29,360
uh uh

2635
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,960
to expire

2636
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,760
or a solution a common ground was

2637
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,520
founded between the two drafts in the uh

2638
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,800
in this configuration model

2639
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,760
because i mean i'm i'm happy to

2640
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,000
merge these two drafts and progress them

2641
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,800
but i would like to make sure that this

2642
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,639
is something that everyone is happy with

2643
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:53,599
is not that we are leaving

2644
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:57,520
something competing behind

2645
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:00,560
and forgetting about it

2646
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:06,639
we don't want to renew the progress drop

2647
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:11,119
and we want to merge this drop and with

2648
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:12,080
the

2649
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:15,280
first configure motorcraft

2650
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,280
okay

2651
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,360
thank you

2652
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:22,159
that's fine thanks

2653
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:24,239
we are ready

2654
01:51:24,239 --> 01:51:28,839
for the last presentation

2655
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:43,119
hello

2656
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:44,880
hello can you hear me

2657
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,320
yes

2658
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:49,440
yeah thank you um i'm sure leo i'm from

2659
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,679
china mobile and

2660
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:53,920
that's the top

2661
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,199
authors of this draft

2662
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,840
it's a high tool

2663
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:03,840
so i will go through quickly

2664
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:05,360
first

2665
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:08,560
we need optional network to access

2666
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:11,440
flaw to support high

2667
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:13,599
quality connections

2668
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:18,639
for areas such as finance medicine

2669
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:20,960
and uh

2670
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:24,159
and the ott companies so previously

2671
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:26,800
usually we use it network to

2672
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:29,840
access network

2673
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:32,480
we suffer from issues

2674
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,000
such as

2675
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,119
touring

2676
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:37,920
and the congestion of package

2677
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,199
so

2678
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:42,000
after transport network

2679
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,440
start to play a more important role in

2680
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:49,280
carrying carrying traffic to access

2681
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:51,679
class

2682
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:55,280
but there are some

2683
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,199
short terms for current optical

2684
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:58,880
transport network

2685
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,040
now for example

2686
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,520
right now optical transport network

2687
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,040
usually

2688
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,360
unify the flows

2689
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,199
it

2690
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:13,840
cannot identify the priority of the

2691
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,520
services

2692
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,520
also

2693
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:20,320
we need and provided

2694
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,960
provide a guaranteed performance for

2695
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:26,080
option network

2696
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,920
another thing is uh

2697
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:30,000
optical networks need to support small

2698
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,400
granularity for

2699
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:35,598
service to access

2700
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:39,840
clause because there are many

2701
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,000
and customer

2702
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,159
to access clause

2703
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:46,880
another thing is we need to support a

2704
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,719
message connection

2705
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:51,440
and the network should be

2706
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,679
dynamic

2707
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:56,400
slide please

2708
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:02,560
so previously we have uh

2709
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:03,760
example

2710
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:07,280
several use cases

2711
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:09,520
the first one is multiple choice

2712
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,599
assessing we need to support the

2713
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:13,920
multi-point automatic point

2714
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:16,639
uh access rather than previously just

2715
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:18,800
point to point

2716
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:22,360
next slide please

2717
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:24,080
uh

2718
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,560
the second use cases high quality leads

2719
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,920
the luck

2720
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,520
previously

2721
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,599
a high quality

2722
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:34,159
uh private land on intel support

2723
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:36,719
unlocked fundraise low latency high

2724
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:39,679
security high reliability

2725
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:40,960
and

2726
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,400
the proposed

2727
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,080
control and management

2728
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,679
system of

2729
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:47,199
of the new

2730
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:49,360
optical network should

2731
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,400
support

2732
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:53,280
differentiation of

2733
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:56,320
sra adapted to dynamic performance

2734
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,520
chains

2735
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:00,000
be aware of traffic demand

2736
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,280
and faster deployment to customer

2737
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:05,520
customers the event

2738
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:08,480
next slide please

2739
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:12,080
another example is claude virtual

2740
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:15,440
reality it require high

2741
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,199
specifications

2742
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:19,199
and so

2743
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:21,360
and high team demand so

2744
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:23,599
also the control and the environment

2745
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:25,679
need to

2746
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:28,960
support awareness of service

2747
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,040
for the most start and end time and

2748
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,560
dynamically

2749
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,719
it turned into the bandwidth

2750
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:38,400
uh next step please

2751
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,960
so in summary and uh requirement for the

2752
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,599
control and management service

2753
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:47,599
for optional network to

2754
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:50,080
exercise

2755
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:51,280
clause

2756
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:54,400
need to support the following core

2757
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:55,679
features

2758
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:57,679
the first is

2759
01:55:57,679 --> 01:55:58,719
it

2760
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:02,400
supports supporter various uh such as uh

2761
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,360
earth

2762
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,880
are

2763
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,960
one two are three sorry uh service

2764
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:10,000
to

2765
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,159
to assess the clause

2766
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:14,480
uh the second feature is a

2767
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,320
service awareness

2768
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,560
it can and if you know the start at the

2769
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,679
end of the service and uh

2770
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:22,880
and the

2771
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:26,080
dynamic uh change the

2772
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,480
sra

2773
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:30,639
according to the requirement of

2774
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:32,500
customers

2775
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:33,760
[Music]

2776
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:35,920
the second the third thing is

2777
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:38,320
reliability it should

2778
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:42,400
adapt to the network with fast recovery

2779
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:45,280
and the last thing is sustainability

2780
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,520
because it needs to support the massive

2781
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,280
access

2782
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:52,800
so next slide please

2783
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,280
so

2784
01:56:55,280 --> 01:57:00,000
uh this uh draft gave the update of the

2785
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,520
pre and uh

2786
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,719
actual total problem and statement

2787
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:06,000
and uh

2788
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,960
this statement annoys more photos are

2789
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,000
optical

2790
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,400
optical specific characteristics and

2791
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,320
it also focuses on control and

2792
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,599
management

2793
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,360
systems

2794
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,239
so

2795
01:57:20,239 --> 01:57:23,520
the intention of this draft is to

2796
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:26,480
confirm the usefulness of

2797
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:27,760
the

2798
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:29,360
optical network

2799
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,760
for exercising clause

2800
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,520
and

2801
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:37,280
this draft either i'd further get

2802
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,760
analyst and the problem statement

2803
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,159
and we call for interest and drawing

2804
01:57:42,159 --> 01:57:45,360
contribution thank you

2805
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,679
thank you

2806
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:00,560
hi um hi guys thank you for

2807
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:03,119
the presentation and i just noticed

2808
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:05,599
on your summary slide that that you're

2809
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:06,960
looking for

2810
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:07,920
um

2811
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,840
contributions and sort of interest in

2812
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,880
the work uh the use cases um were quite

2813
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,719
high level it will be really interesting

2814
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:15,760
to know

2815
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,840
uh what specific requirements have been

2816
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:20,719
derived from those use cases uh the

2817
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:22,960
the point i want to make is that there's

2818
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,320
a european

2819
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,320
um commission funded project called

2820
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,960
terraflow that that i'm a member of and

2821
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:31,440
and we're also working on this area sort

2822
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,760
of using a an optical underlay for

2823
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:36,719
interconnecting cloud resources for

2824
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:38,560
um terabit

2825
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,480
packets services

2826
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,760
so there is maybe some interesting

2827
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,320
[Music]

2828
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:45,840
requirements that we've identified in

2829
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,920
that project although it is research it

2830
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:50,480
has commercial applicability there are

2831
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,920
operators involved um in the project so

2832
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,080
i'm wondering if there's maybe some

2833
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:56,960
uh

2834
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:59,119
some technical

2835
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:01,280
uh findings conclusions that we've sort

2836
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,840
of documented that may be useful

2837
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:07,040
for this work i will post those maybe

2838
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:09,119
in the chat window and follow up with

2839
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:09,840
you

2840
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:12,320
offline

2841
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:15,440
that will be great

2842
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:16,719
amiana

2843
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:19,360
thank you thank you for for you to raise

2844
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:22,080
the very important point as a few more

2845
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,159
information uh

2846
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:25,840
from the

2847
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:28,320
previous days on this ietf meeting we

2848
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,480
are also aware of some

2849
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,920
nice work from irtif from the cam buff

2850
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:36,639
and from some other work groups talking

2851
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:38,159
about the future of the routing

2852
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:41,920
protocols and it looks we are also

2853
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:44,239
from this draft we are also evaluating

2854
01:59:44,239 --> 01:59:46,960
where is the filter gaps and

2855
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,080
try to

2856
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:51,440
find the next objective we are setting

2857
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:54,239
to the current protocol stack

2858
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:55,280
and

2859
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:56,719
yeah

2860
01:59:56,719 --> 01:59:58,719
we would like to invite more review and

2861
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:01,679
