1
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,040
okay it's 1 p.m so i'm gonna make a

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,480
start uh just a reminder to the on-site

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,640
attendees that oh there's no qr code but

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,080
there's qr codes on the backs of the

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,320
different chairs uh to reduce your

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,840
on-site attendance or you can do it from

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,480
the ietf agenda online

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
so please do you will have to do that to

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,880
ask questions so please remember to do

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,238
that and with that i will start

11
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,239
with the chair slides rodney just chip

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,680
in as needed

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,960
uh

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,840
so

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,920
first of all welcome to the quantum

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,239
mechanic research group session

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,719
it's a reminder this session is being

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,879
recorded

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,800
i'm going to go through the usual irtf

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,879
note well i'm just going to leave this

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,519
on for a few seconds

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,520
and as a usual reminder the irtf is

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,880
conduct research not a standards

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,240
development organization so as a

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,200
reminder we don't do standards work

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,320
in the qrg

27
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,920
a special reminder tips for this meeting

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,200
so again another reminder that the

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,360
session's been recorded so as i've

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,719
already mentioned foreign personal

31
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,880
participants please register through the

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,040
onsite tool or the qr code on the back

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,719
of some of the chairs

34
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,318
and for remote participants please make

35
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,080
sure your audio and video are off unless

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,800
you're presenting

37
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
and with that uh let's begin with the

38
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,640
chair slides um it seems um most things

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,720
are working so uh hopefully this will be

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,440
actually pretty quick um

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,200
and hopefully everybody can hear me and

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,560
i don't drift away too far away from the

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,040
microphone

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,160
uh

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,440
probably uh just worth pointing out you

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,680
know that we uh

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,040
we actually haven't assigned a note

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
taker just for the record since we're

49
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,720
starting the session

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,959
oh yes we have bruno reisman who

51
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
volunteered to take notes uh for the

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
session

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,160
thanks bruno thanks bruno

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,000
um

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,800
yes so the agenda for today is uh we

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,680
start with some uh administration of

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,959
stuff and the rg status um and well

58
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,680
hopefully no more hybrid meeting issues

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
then kosciuk uh will present uh the

60
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,920
draft on uh it's called use cases but i

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,120
think it changed to application

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
scenarios

63
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,319
and

64
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,400
then we'll have a presentation from bart

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
about uh the quantum network explorer

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,159
and about programming applications for

67
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,000
the quantum internet this is a research

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,080
presentation and not a draft

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,480
presentation um

70
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,840
and we'll have some space for a

71
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,480
discussion um

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,080
i put on that point on the discussion

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,799
point is if there was an online platform

74
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,720
like ibm quantum experience but for a

75
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,080
quantum network what would you like to

76
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
see in one but otherwise it's an open

77
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,599
floor

78
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,120
we only have an hour

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,799
but we don't have a very packed agenda

80
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
so we don't need to rush hopefully

81
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,799
so

82
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,959
in terms of status

83
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,480
the principles draft which we've been

84
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,319
working on for the past two years it has

85
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
been reviewed thanks mario joseman petit

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,280
the comments have been addressed on the

87
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
mailing list

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,519
and it's now back for another read

89
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,519
for review

90
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
it's not going to be presented at this

91
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,239
meeting

92
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,640
as there's nothing near really other

93
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,199
than it's been reviewed

94
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,839
uh but the other active draft is going

95
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,680
to be presented today uh by kaushik

96
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,440
after i'm done

97
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,160
and in terms of other status we had

98
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
another seminar in february by mark

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
kaplan from very cloud

100
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,320
it's available on youtube if you've

101
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
missed it

102
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
the next one still hasn't been announced

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,919
and it's cbd who will be

104
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,320
and as an interesting other update is

105
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,960
the qrg was mentioned in a publication

106
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
about uh

107
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,880
what workers on standardization but i'll

108
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,320
make a note it was mentioned in that

109
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,080
document that qrg does not make it for

110
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,919
constantization it was sort of just

111
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,759
related work section but if you're

112
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
interested in the article please head

113
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
over to archive and have a look at what

114
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,720
standardization efforts are in quantum

115
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
networks going on in europe

116
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,400
uh and with that said uh

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,840
that's me done for the chair slides

118
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,840
rodney do you have anything to add

119
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,880
nope just that i'm sorry i'm not there

120
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,960
in person with you all in vienna you're

121
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,680
just uh travel restrictions uh just now

122
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
getting lifted but

123
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,120
thanks to wojtek for being there in

124
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,000
person and uh i'm here with you

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,800
thanks

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,880
colin would you like to say something

127
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
uh yeah can you hear me

128
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,759
yes yes yes okay good i just want to

129
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,639
check on the uh principles draft is the

130
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,720
belief of the authors and the chairs

131
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,000
that this addresses all the comments

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,240
so can you repeat the question

133
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,320
uh for the um the quantum internet

134
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,199
principles draft is the belief of the

135
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,639
authors and the chairs that this

136
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,240
addresses all of marie jose's comments

137
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,120
uh

138
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,680
yes that is my understanding

139
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,720
okay great thank you

140
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,560
thanks colin um okay so in that case uh

141
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,919
first on

142
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,960
uh

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,160
the agenda is koshik uh would you like

144
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,120
to

145
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,560
no

146
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
we have the dex pressure can you click

147
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
the share pre-shared preloaded slides

148
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,280
instead

149
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,160
another screen

150
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,319
just next to your share screen there

151
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,639
should be a share preloaded slides and

152
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,240
the one labeled as use cases should be

153
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
the one you should be sharing

154
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,160
here

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,720
you know like same video

156
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,880
yeah can you hear me yes i can hear you

157
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,240
yeah i don't know

158
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,930
where is it

159
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,800
[Music]

160
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,319
so just next to the button you press the

161
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,160
share screen there's a button that looks

162
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,199
like a document that says share

163
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,080
preloaded slides

164
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,800
it's this one yeah

165
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,680
brilliant the floor is your squash

166
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,759
cool

167
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,840
thank you i think sorry for that uh

168
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
small delay so it's a small talk

169
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,520
actually we haven't made uh too many

170
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,160
updates like it was like mostly uh small

171
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,120
um

172
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
changes so that's what we can ask you to

173
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,199
try to take

174
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,560
yes you can ask her to speak very

175
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,479
clearly and slowly because it's a big

176
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,880
room and we might lose out a bit on

177
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,840
understanding you so

178
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,039
thanks okay okay uh so now is it clear

179
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,199
this one

180
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,000
okay um so sorry everyone for this small

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,039
uh delay so actually this will not be a

182
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,879
very long talk like it should be like we

183
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,759
have made a very uh small changes

184
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,720
uh okay let's uh go back to

185
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
what changes we have made so first

186
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,440
before going that let's focus on uh some

187
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,160
of our previous histories like for

188
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,680
example last year in july we presented

189
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,520
our version seven at the ietf 111

190
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,759
and then we received some comments and

191
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,400
again in august 20

192
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
we uploaded the version eight

193
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,120
and then again we received some more

194
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,840
comments from rodney and john manson and

195
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
then we we

196
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,679
added those those comments on our like

197
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,159
uh version nine and we uploaded in march

198
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,799
uh march for

199
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,360
and again this year like um on march 6

200
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,839
we uploaded version 10 where we

201
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,839
pointed out that there are some more

202
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,839
issues in n1 version

203
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,399
9 so so that's it

204
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,320
so in a nutshell like uh these are the

205
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,640
updates mostly we added some extra

206
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,360
references and then everything except in

207
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,279
section

208
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,440
3.2.2 there we added one extra like

209
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,959
applications on on quantum senses

210
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,959
it is called

211
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,480
interferometric uh

212
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
telescopes using quantum information so

213
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
today i'll just explain like what it is

214
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,160
in

215
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,680
a very give you a very brief idea and

216
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,279
that's it

217
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,000
so yeah so what is that application it's

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,080
a quantum sensor application so what

219
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,040
happened like um we use interferometric

220
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,360
techniques to combine signals from

221
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,959
multiple telescope to obtain

222
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,600
measurements with higher resolution

223
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,720
and

224
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,399
what we observed that um this kind of uh

225
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
joint measurement actually with the help

226
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
of this kind of joint measurement one

227
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
can get higher resolution compared to

228
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,360
like if you use the uh telescopes

229
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
individually

230
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,399
so

231
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,640
the problem is that

232
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,040
in the info when we try to do this joint

233
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,480
measurement what we need to do we need

234
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,800
to send those signals like

235
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,680
from one telescope to another and

236
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
the problem is that if there is a noise

237
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,760
in the communication channel

238
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,399
then uh there could be some

239
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,279
kind of phase fluctuation or your photon

240
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,880
might even get lost

241
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
to avoid these issues like one can one

242
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,120
well what we can do we can use some

243
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,680
quantum and actually so this kind of uh

244
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
channel laws

245
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,680
limits the

246
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,320
the use of this

247
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
interferometric techniques because it

248
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,040
can actually reduce the

249
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,279
um

250
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,720
the

251
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
area of the wide area of those of those

252
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
telescopes

253
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,600
so

254
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,839
what we can do we can use it to increase

255
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,680
the the

256
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
the spread of that of those telescopes

257
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,839
what we can do or to increase the

258
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,600
distance between two telescopes what we

259
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,519
can do we can use intermediate quantum

260
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,279
repeaters and those quantum repeaters

261
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,720
can send the for like photons like yeah

262
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
that can solve the problem theoretically

263
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,560
of course like um

264
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,839
if we want to

265
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,600
implement them in impact it's like there

266
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
like lots of lots of things we need to

267
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,079
be needs to be handled uh as this is

268
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,040
true also almost all the applications we

269
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,839
we pointed out in this in this chart so

270
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
yeah that's the that's the only thing we

271
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
have included here

272
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,279
and uh with that like we

273
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,160
focus on our next step like um so this

274
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,640
version 10 is relatively stable now we

275
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
uh addressed most of the comments made

276
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
by rodney and joe

277
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,720
and uh

278
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,920
also we

279
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,640
provide our replies on an amazing list

280
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,800
and if there are like more updates quick

281
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,240
updates then

282
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,519
we can also

283
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,279
you know we are ready to

284
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,600
um make those updates like in our

285
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,800
version

286
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,360
10 and we upload a new version

287
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,959
and now the question is okay do the

288
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,120
chairs uh think that the draft for the

289
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,680
version 10 is ready for the last call in

290
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,839
general so it was like we i think

291
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,880
started

292
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,800
one and a half years ago but i joined it

293
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,600
i think

294
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,079
last year so yeah i think that's it

295
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,079
thanks

296
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,720
thanks kashik um first are there any

297
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
questions from either online or on-site

298
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
attendees as a reminder to on-site

299
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,959
attendees please still click the rice

300
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,839
hand to join the queue

301
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,959
yes rodney

302
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,440
so speaking i guess as an individual

303
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,680
reviewer rather than as as a co-chair

304
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,240
here let's see um

305
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,079
kyle shake so the uh

306
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,079
can you go back

307
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,880
let's see what was the date of version

308
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,439
10 here

309
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,720
version 10 is part

310
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,880
6 let's see

311
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,120
and so my uh

312
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
my round of comments on this was the

313
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,160
13th right the latest round

314
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,519
you mean march 13th right

315
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,639
yeah march 13th which chong changgang

316
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,079
replied to

317
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
on the 19th right

318
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,040
let's see

319
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,200
um so he agreed to he agreed in that in

320
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
that email to uh

321
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,079
make some changes to it but it but it

322
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,160
sounds like we don't yet have complete

323
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,920
convergence on a couple of the things i

324
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,399
raised in in the in the email

325
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,360
but so so your plan is to uh

326
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,639
um

327
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,800
produce a version 11 sometime soon

328
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,399
yeah so that's the thing i think like

329
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,680
okay so i

330
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,600
see that okay it was like on march 13

331
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,839
yeah so i think we will update like

332
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,000
after the meeting like we'll uh

333
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,920
address all the other comments and then

334
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,639
upload another one

335
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
okay in that case it sounds like

336
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,440
those comments have to be addressed

337
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,880
before we do an rg last call

338
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,240
yeah i think we're getting close i'm not

339
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,000
sure we're quite there you know even

340
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,680
after these are addressed because it

341
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,519
sounds like there's not yet full

342
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,440
agreement on a couple of the the issues

343
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,079
on it so i'll i'll try to reply on the

344
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,760
mailing list to the to chongang's

345
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,199
questions here and maybe we can reach

346
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,959
some convergence on the mailing list

347
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,040
thanks rodney

348
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,920
any other comments before we move on to

349
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,319
the next

350
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,600
um actually so one one more comment or

351
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,560
question

352
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,800
um

353
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,199
for somebody who knows the the uh

354
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,839
production rfc uh editing and production

355
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,959
process better than i do colin or anyone

356
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,000
um this document's going to need i think

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,839
one more good round of uh of uh

358
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,639
wordsmithing and and uh editing before

359
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,399
before it's really ready for final

360
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,360
review

361
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,600
um

362
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
whose responsibility is that the the the

363
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,199
the authors the the or the uh the uh

364
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,079
chairs or does uh ietf have access to

365
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,519
some service to help with

366
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,560
wordsmithing and grammar editing and the

367
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,639
like

368
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,680
colin would you like to go

369
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,000
uh yeah the the rfc editor does uh some

370
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,639
copy editing uh at the end of the

371
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,800
process after it's been through the uh

372
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,160
the last call

373
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,560
and the irs g review

374
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
so uh if i think that the responsibility

375
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,720
is for the the authors to get it into as

376
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,160
good a shape as they can and then the

377
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,839
rfc edits will copy

378
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,639
editor okay good thanks

379
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,920
okay

380
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,199
thanks kaushik

381
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,800
uh doesn't seem like there's anything

382
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
else

383
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,639
bart would you like to

384
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,279
uh

385
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,320
present

386
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,600
and share preloaded slides

387
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,959
um yeah let's see if i can

388
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,839
manage to do that

389
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,880
okay

390
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,360
you've got 20 minutes bart

391
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,160
okay thanks all right so hello everyone

392
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,880
my name is bart apart from effects i am

393
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,800
a pc student at q-tech in delft

394
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,519
and um yeah so today i would like to

395
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,359
talk briefly about

396
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,119
something we've been working on

397
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,280
something called netgasm so netcast is a

398
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,919
low-level instruction set architecture

399
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,319
um for hybrid quantum classical programs

400
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,000
in a quantum internet

401
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,720
so

402
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,359
this has been a thing that we've been

403
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
designing and implementing

404
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,160
towards enabling

405
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
application programming

406
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,000
in a quantum internet so really the idea

407
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,160
is that given that you have some kind of

408
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,559
physical quantum internet and given that

409
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,760
you

410
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
may have an idea about an application

411
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,679
like qpd or client's quantum computation

412
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,840
the question is like how would you

413
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
represent this application how would you

414
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,440
program this and how would you execute

415
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,360
this and so netcast is one of the

416
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
components towards this that we have

417
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,039
been designing and implementing as i

418
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,160
said

419
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,880
and later on i will also explain how

420
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,120
netcasting fits into something called

421
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,440
quantum network explorer or q and e for

422
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,720
short

423
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
but most of my talk will focus on net

424
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,760
custom itself

425
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
and then again at the end i will

426
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,160
briefly talk a bit more about this

427
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,880
quantum network explorer

428
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,360
so just a quick introduction first i'm

429
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,840
in the quantum internet division

430
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,280
within qtec

431
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,440
and in in this division we

432
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,880
do all kinds of things related to

433
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,480
quantum internet so there are people

434
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,200
working on hardware

435
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,760
for example people working on

436
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,320
quantum internet nodes based on nitrogen

437
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,400
vacancy centers and diamonds

438
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,080
and doing experiments with those there

439
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,559
are people working on simulations of the

440
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,280
quantum internet and people thinking for

441
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,520
example about repeaters how they should

442
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,200
work or how they should be placed in the

443
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,640
quantum internet

444
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,559
and then there are people that work on

445
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,559
software for controlling and programming

446
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,880
such a quantum internet and so in this

447
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,640
last group this this is what i've been

448
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,840
involved in

449
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,600
and one of the questions we've asked is

450
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,520
given that you have some some physical

451
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,440
quantum network

452
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,400
or quantum internet how would you write

453
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
arbitrary

454
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,720
high-level application codes and execute

455
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,600
it

456
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,320
in this quantum internet and so also

457
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,480
specifically how would you execute and

458
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,320
write program code for

459
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,160
individual nodes in this quantum

460
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,679
internet

461
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,240
and so towards that that ends we have

462
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,360
designed netcast and i'll explain more

463
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,039
about what this is

464
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,280
and around this netcast

465
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,760
which is a low-level language we've also

466
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,080
developed an sdk a software development

467
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,039
kit

468
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,120
in python which allows you to write

469
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,000
applications in a more higher level

470
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,039
with just standard python code

471
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,799
and we've implemented this this netcast

472
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,039
language and also the python sdk and we

473
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,720
have also

474
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,400
connected this to

475
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,480
some of our hardware down in lab based

476
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,120
on envs in diamonds

477
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,200
and with that we have kind of showcased

478
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,400
the first

479
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
full

480
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,000
software and quantum network stack

481
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,360
on hardware

482
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,039
going all the way from high level python

483
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,159
codes to

484
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,840
physical

485
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,080
quantum networking operations being

486
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,480
being executed

487
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,880
so first a little bit of

488
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,480
terminology

489
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,000
so

490
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,799
the quantum internet as i'm

491
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,679
treating it here it consists of nodes

492
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,120
and specifically it consists of

493
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,799
programmable nodes

494
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,400
so there might be some other nodes in

495
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
between these nodes like repeaters that

496
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,799
maybe do not have much

497
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,240
control or

498
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,760
expressivity but

499
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
here we are mainly focused on

500
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,280
programmable nodes so these are these

501
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,039
blue circles on the right

502
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,559
and these nodes have some kind of

503
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,240
classical processing unit and a quantum

504
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,559
processing unit and in theory these

505
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,320
these units can

506
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,559
execute arbitrary code so arbitrary

507
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,400
classical codes and also arbitrary

508
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,280
quantum code like quantum gates

509
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,360
but also entanglement generation with

510
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,760
other processing nodes so using these

511
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,960
entanglement links in green

512
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,039
the processing nodes are also

513
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,280
connected by classical links in black

514
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,039
and applications running on these

515
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,640
programmable nodes

516
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,679
are in general multipartite protocols

517
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,039
so consisting of multiple nodes jointly

518
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,799
performing a certain application or

519
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,880
protocol so you can think of for example

520
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,120
quantum key distribution

521
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,480
some kind of distributed quantum

522
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,559
computing protocol or maybe blinds

523
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,280
quantum computation

524
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,200
and so the joint

525
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,799
execution

526
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,240
of all these nodes we called application

527
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,360
in this case

528
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,200
uh but then each of these nodes

529
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,240
individually has to run its own

530
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
code as do has to do its own operations

531
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,240
and for each node we call this a program

532
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,000
and for rest of the talk i'll mostly

533
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,600
talk about how to

534
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
write and execute the single node

535
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,760
program that is part of a multi-part

536
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,240
night application

537
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,360
so

538
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,000
you could think a bit about what kinds

539
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
of operations do you have in such a

540
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
quantum network program

541
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,480
and it's quite interesting because there

542
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
can be different kinds of operations

543
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
that can all be interleaved and can also

544
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,039
be dependent on each other

545
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,559
so these programs they might

546
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,720
send or receive classical messages to

547
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,960
other nodes they might do antagonic

548
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
generation with other nodes

549
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,840
they might do some classical processing

550
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,120
um

551
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,440
or they might have might want to do

552
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,600
quantum local quantum gates or

553
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,159
measurements and so all these kinds of

554
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,080
operations can be done in a program and

555
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,679
all these kinds of operations we want to

556
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,720
be able

557
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,520
to express in our code and also to to

558
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,240
execute them

559
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,799
so another thing that is part of our our

560
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,320
context is that

561
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,240
we assume each of the nodes in the

562
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
quantum network or at least each of the

563
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,919
programmable nodes to implement a

564
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,360
network stack

565
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,080
um so on the right we see the layers of

566
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,320
the network stack that we assume to be

567
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,640
implemented

568
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,400
and so of course each of these layers in

569
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,880
the network stack has its own

570
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,960
uh responsibilities and it kind of

571
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,880
provides an interface to the higher

572
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
layers and abstracts away certain

573
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
details

574
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,000
uh

575
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,480
mark can i interrupt for just a second

576
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,760
sure

577
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,720
um your video isn't on at the moment i

578
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,400
don't know if that was what you intended

579
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,840
or not because i know you had yours on

580
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,360
earlier

581
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,960
oh right yeah

582
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
um yeah let me just have it on for your

583
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,640
presentation and

584
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,200
i find it helpful but

585
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
okay good thank you this will be all now

586
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,480
yeah thanks thanks for listening

587
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,000
um

588
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,760
yeah so this

589
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,360
quantum network stack

590
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,840
if you want to read more about this um

591
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,039
here are some references for example our

592
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,279
very own voytek has written something

593
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,960
about network layer for example among

594
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,039
among other things the link layer

595
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,039
protocol this has been this paper but so

596
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,880
this talk again will be about netcasting

597
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,120
is about the highest layer in this

598
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,200
network stack picture namely the

599
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,080
application layer

600
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,559
okay so first a bit about execution

601
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,559
model all a node in a quantum internet

602
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,159
the way we we see it we use some kind of

603
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,559
model that you could call coprocessor

604
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,440
model so within our node we

605
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,000
logically have this separation between

606
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,760
an application layer

607
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,640
and

608
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,960
a component called called the quantum

609
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,279
processing unit and so the application

610
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,159
layer

611
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,559
is responsible for classical processing

612
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,320
and also for sending and receiving

613
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,559
messages to and from other nodes

614
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,960
the quantum processing unit is the unit

615
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,400
that

616
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,159
can do quantum operations so it is

617
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,320
responsible for the local quantum gates

618
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,840
measurements but also entangled

619
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,159
generation with other nodes

620
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,520
and these two components they

621
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,559
communicate from each other through

622
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,400
netcast

623
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,919
and one way to think about these two

624
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,080
logically separated components is to

625
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,600
think of the application layer as like

626
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,520
the main cpu starting this program

627
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,440
the coprocessor or the quantum

628
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,960
processing unit

629
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,120
as some kind of coprocessor

630
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,000
to which the cpu delegates certain parts

631
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,120
of the program namely

632
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,200
the quantum parts

633
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,240
and this delegation is done by

634
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,440
the application layer sending a block of

635
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,400
codes

636
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,240
and this block of code we call a net

637
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,679
custom routine

638
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,919
and this routine consists of

639
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,400
instructions in the netcast language and

640
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,159
in the next slide i will give you an

641
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,480
example of how this looks like

642
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,880
but the idea is that during execution of

643
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,720
a program

644
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,320
the cpu or the application layer is the

645
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,080
one that that starts the program and

646
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,679
then it will send routines consisting of

647
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,440
netcast and code to this content

648
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
processing unit the quantum processing

649
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,640
unit

650
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,799
interprets the instructions these

651
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,240
netcast instructions and acts on them

652
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,520
and it will

653
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,440
at the end of a routine send back

654
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,760
results of this routine it will send it

655
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,600
back to the application there

656
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,440
maybe the application there does some

657
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,840
classical computation or communication

658
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
so on the bottom right by the way you

659
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,640
see this

660
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,080
this

661
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,600
example like timeline from left to right

662
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,159
and then the application layer can send

663
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,120
more

664
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,640
netcast routines maybe based on some

665
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,240
classical communication that i did

666
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,279
earlier

667
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,640
uh one

668
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,039
interesting thing i want to note uh is

669
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,320
like a difference

670
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,400
between this model and

671
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,799
model using quantum computing so without

672
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,640
a networking dimension

673
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
so in quantum computing there is a

674
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,880
similar thing going on where often

675
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,480
what we call here the application there

676
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,039
would send blocks of quantum codes to

677
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,120
the quantum processing unit

678
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
um

679
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,159
but then at the end of such a block all

680
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,080
the qubits would just be measured out

681
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,360
and they won't

682
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,640
stay

683
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,919
in this case we also have

684
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,240
scenarios where we want these qubits to

685
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,279
persist

686
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,720
in between execution of separate

687
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
quantum code blocks

688
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,480
because it could for example be that we

689
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,559
have a quantum

690
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,240
bit in memory

691
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,720
and then we want first to do some

692
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,360
classical communication we maybe want to

693
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,480
wait for

694
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,039
message a classical message coming from

695
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,200
another node and only when we have

696
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
received that we can decide

697
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,760
maybe based on this message what we want

698
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
to do on this qubit

699
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,840
that is still

700
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,039
okay so the the netcast language itself

701
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,039
so i talked about these blocks of code

702
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,559
these routines

703
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,559
that are sent to the quantum processing

704
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,440
unit and are executed by this unit

705
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,480
um

706
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,919
so the net custom language is quite a

707
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,679
low-level language it's basically an

708
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,960
assembly

709
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,279
like language um

710
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,960
and if you know a little bit about

711
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,000
quantum computing maybe you might know

712
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,880
this language called open chasm

713
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,360
which is quite similar so netcasting is

714
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,760
quite similar to opencastle but

715
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,240
uh there are some more differences that

716
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,440
i won't

717
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,279
go into much detail right now but one of

718
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,279
the differences is that

719
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,159
uh the addition of instructions related

720
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,200
to remote integral generation

721
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,360
so those are these create epr and

722
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,679
receive epr instructions

723
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,799
and these instructions

724
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,279
when they are

725
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,279
executed by the quantum processing units

726
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,159
they are

727
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,440
actually

728
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,200
kind of sent forward to the network

729
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,840
stack that is housed in the

730
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,600
in the nodes so the network stack

731
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,840
handles requests for remote environment

732
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,960
generation

733
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
so if there is a create epr

734
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,240
instruction in the netcasting routine

735
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,399
this will be forwarded to the network

736
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,320
stack as being a request and then a

737
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,240
network that handles this request it

738
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,039
will maybe generates a certain number of

739
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,960
pairs with another node

740
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,559
meanwhile

741
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,039
the program code has this weight all

742
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,279
instruction and this way it all

743
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,720
actually

744
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,120
makes the program block and it blocks

745
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,039
until uh these qubits or maybe or

746
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,960
whatever request was sent to the network

747
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,240
stack

748
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,200
it will wait until this request has been

749
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,440
completed

750
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,399
so for example it will wait until remote

751
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,880
entanglement generation has been

752
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,080
generated

753
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,159
and when that has done has been done

754
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,080
this wait all instruction unblocks and

755
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,240
it continues executing these next

756
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,240
instructions

757
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,200
so

758
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,279
netgasm is um

759
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,559
quite low level as you you saw

760
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,799
also

761
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,760
so

762
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,039
netcast i'm only handles like the

763
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,600
quantum operations of the quantum gates

764
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,279
and also the remote and thermal

765
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,120
generation

766
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,200
so what we built around that person is

767
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,240
this

768
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,559
python sdk by the software development

769
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,440
kit

770
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,520
and using this

771
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,960
software development kit you can

772
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,640
actually write your program code

773
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
including also classical processing so

774
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,640
you can just write your classical

775
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,480
processing code as python

776
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,720
code also classical communication you

777
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,080
can express using this

778
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,440
this python sdk or python library

779
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,399
and then all the quantum operations you

780
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,240
also don't have to write it directly in

781
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,320
netcast and you can also write them in

782
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,799
just arbitrary or like in high level

783
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,080
python code

784
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,559
and then these quantum related

785
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,080
statements in quite encode are

786
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,159
automatically compiled

787
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,080
down to netcast

788
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,519
routines

789
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,679
and sent to the quantum processing unit

790
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,120
so in this way you can just write your

791
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,440
whole program just in python code the

792
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,039
relevant parts are compiled to netgasm

793
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,600
and also the communication between

794
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,039
application layer and the quantum

795
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,279
processing unit is handled kind of under

796
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,840
the hood

797
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,360
so

798
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,799
you can already

799
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,519
use this sdk right now you can

800
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,679
download it as a python package you can

801
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,200
see the source code and get it on the

802
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,799
final slide have some some links

803
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,679
you can also already run programs

804
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,080
written this way on a simulator

805
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,840
we actually have two

806
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,919
uh simulators that we support one is

807
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,120
called

808
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,840
squid asm this is based on net squid

809
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,440
netscript is a

810
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,000
quantum network simulator also developed

811
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,159
within qtac

812
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,279
it allows among other things for the

813
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,120
simulation of noise which is quite nice

814
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,440
another simulator that we support is

815
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,960
similar problem

816
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,360
which is a bit older but also quite

817
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,880
extensive

818
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,480
uh so you can also use that

819
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,159
um

820
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,320
but we also

821
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,440
um

822
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,559
we don't only want to use this sdk and

823
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,640
use netcast and to

824
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,519
run

825
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,000
programs on a simulator we also

826
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,440
connected this this software to

827
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,240
our hardware down in the lab

828
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,559
um so on the left you see it's quite

829
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,399
small but it's just some code that we

830
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,640
wrote using this part in sdk

831
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,039
and on the right you see a picture from

832
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,960
a paper we wrote about

833
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,519
an experimental demonstration

834
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,440
of using

835
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,600
our hardware consisting of two nodes and

836
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,440
we kind of controlled these two ultra

837
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,399
nodes

838
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,240
using various layers in software and

839
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,559
then desired highest layers of the

840
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,840
software actually used

841
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,320
or actually consisted of this python sdk

842
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,559
and netcasting so in this way we showed

843
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,279
that you can really use this high level

844
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,679
representation of programs

845
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,080
and connect it and actually run it with

846
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,799
actual hardware

847
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,360
so then i want to mention the quantum

848
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,039
network explorer or q e abbreviated so

849
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,440
quantum network explorer is a

850
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,559
platform

851
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,720
that we've launched at the end of last

852
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,559
year

853
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,679
from

854
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,360
from qtec

855
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,399
so you see the link there

856
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,480

857
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,399
on this website there is some more

858
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,840
general information about content

859
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,760
networks what can you do with them

860
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,000
um but there's also this thing called an

861
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,760
editor in this editor you can actually

862
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,559
run

863
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,720
and simulate

864
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,559
some pre-programmed

865
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,039
quantum network applications you can see

866
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,199
a nice visualization of these

867
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,679
simulations so for example you can

868
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,239
run a qkd application and then you see

869
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,918
like some qubits being created and

870
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,440
entanglements

871
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,599
being established you see which kinds of

872
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,359
operations are being done

873
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,879
so this is quite a nice way to kind of

874
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,399
get a kind of feel of how quantum

875
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,639
network applications

876
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,918
work

877
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,199
so as i said the programs that you can

878
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,879
run and visualize right now are

879
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,280
pre-programmed but those programs have

880
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,599
actually been programmed using the

881
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,639
python sdk that i mentioned before

882
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,239
and you can actually now also

883
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,879
use this python sdk yourself to write

884
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,719
your own applications

885
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,639
and we are

886
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,000
working on

887
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,679
making it possible to

888
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,440
also upload your own written

889
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,879
applications to

890
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,280
q and e to see visualizations of the

891
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,839
simulation there

892
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,520
and what's i think quite exciting is

893
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,400
that

894
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,200
at some point hopefully

895
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,760
soon-ish in the future when the

896
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,720
our

897
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,640
physical physical quantum internet is

898
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,240
ready enough

899
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,440
we will

900
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,920
connect this to cuny as one and when

901
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
that has happened you can

902
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,119
write your own quantum network

903
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,640
applications

904
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,320
uh and then through this q and e

905
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,359
platform you can run them on the actual

906
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,078
quantum internet hardware

907
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,200
there's some quick things there's still

908
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,560
a lot of things to do and to improve

909
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,079
um

910
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,400
so yeah i won't go into too much detail

911
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,240
right now we can maybe discuss it more

912
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,760
if you if you want

913
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,920
but this integration between classical

914
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
code and quantum code so the quantum

915
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,280
code that is being compiled in netcast

916
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,000
it's it's not quite

917
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,599
nice or efficient and also it doesn't

918
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,920
allow for a lot of optimization ahead of

919
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,280
time in this in the current

920
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,520
implementation at least so there's some

921
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,520
improvements to be made with respect to

922
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,079
compilation and optimization

923
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,359
and of course so this thing that i

924
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,800
mentioned that we still want to connect

925
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,680
uni to actual hardware

926
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,599
so again this is not possible yet but

927
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,960
hopefully

928
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,839
um

929
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,760
well soon

930
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,240
but no guarantees

931
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,119
so in the as a conclusion

932
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,720
sorry so netcast is a language um

933
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,200
an interface to control nodes

934
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,520
also to express programs

935
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,839
for nodes in a quantum network you can

936
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,839
use it to program and run arbitrary

937
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,560
applications

938
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,880
you can use a python sdk to simplify

939
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,520
writing code it's in a more high level

940
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,680
and this sdk is part of

941
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,880
this q e quant network explorer platform

942
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,320
you can run programs on various

943
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,480
simulators and

944
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,280
we

945
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,040
in our own lab we showed that you can

946
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,880
also run to

947
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,440
use it to run at reveal hardware

948
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,560
and then below you see some links to the

949
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,320
python sdk so from netcast q a

950
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,040
um and the link to

951
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,480
q e itself

952
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,880
and finally just a pre-print link of the

953
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,599
of the netcast on paper

954
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,280
i just want to quickly thanks tank to

955
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,160
give thanks to my colleagues who also

956
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,320
worked on designing and implementing

957
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,760
netgasm

958
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,119
um

959
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,280
and also just thanks i

960
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,200
want to say thank you to you for having

961
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,640
me at

962
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,040
uh showing this work and thanks for your

963
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,520
attention

964
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,040
uh thanks bart

965
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,720
thanks for the presentation we have

966
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,920
actually an on-site question can i

967
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,920
remind everybody on the on-site to

968
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,520
please say your name first and then ask

969
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,920
a question

970
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,920
hi uh hi bart this is kiriti so i have a

971
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,000
couple of questions are you implicitly

972
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,680
assuming that there are two nodes in the

973
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,040
network or

974
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,560
are you planning

975
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,240
to have multi

976
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,440
multiple nodes in the network

977
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,079
so when you say create asm pair is it

978
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,079
between me and the other guy or can you

979
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:16,880
say

980
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,040
between me and

981
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,839
node x

982
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,760
um yeah so i mean between me and node x

983
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,839
so you do need to know

984
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,000
some information about the network

985
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,680
so for now we're kind of just assuming

986
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,119
that you know there is this other node

987
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,359
with this name or maybe this node id or

988
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,359
something and then in your

989
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,200
your netcast and code you would refer to

990
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,880
this id

991
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
okay and and

992
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,160
is it that when you say create asm pair

993
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,640
you get perfect fidelity or do you also

994
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,800
think about distillation

995
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,280
improving the fidelity of your

996
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,359
um your your entanglement

997
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,520
so you would

998
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,599
in your program code you would specify a

999
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,000
certain minimum fidelity that you would

1000
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,560
like to to have

1001
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,440
of this epr pair then it's up to the

1002
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
network stack actually to try and

1003
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,960
produce this

1004
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,119
this pair with this fidelity and if it

1005
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,560
does so by using maybe some kind of

1006
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,640
[Music]

1007
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,560
filtering or destination that is up to

1008
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,960
the network stack but actually from the

1009
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,680
application layer this should be

1010
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,440
not really visible the application just

1011
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,599
wants to to have this epr pair with a

1012
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,920
certain fidelity and how it gets created

1013
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,200
yeah

1014
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,119
it doesn't really care

1015
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,920
makes sense thank you

1016
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,160
rodney you're next to the queue

1017
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,320
thanks um bart you go back to i think

1018
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,920
it's slide six page six there about

1019
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,839
had the uh yeah timeline on it yeah like

1020
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,680
this um

1021
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,720
so the

1022
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,599
timeline there left to right on the

1023
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,599
bottom shows

1024
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,319
half layer and qpu am i right that this

1025
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,440
is the

1026
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,079
interaction between

1027
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,560
the controlling software and and the

1028
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,160
actual quantum device at one node

1029
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,720
yes correct

1030
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,640
okay what about what about coordination

1031
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,119
between nodes i don't understand the the

1032
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,119
the uh

1033
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,119
how you handle um

1034
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,520
synchronization and events between nodes

1035
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,160
on this

1036
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,640
um yeah so this is actually mostly

1037
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,319
it should be handled manually just in

1038
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,359
the

1039
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,119
classical code part of the programs so

1040
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,640
if you

1041
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,960
write two separate programs and for two

1042
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,040
different notes you have to make sure

1043
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,400
yourself that

1044
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,079
any accent is uh matched by receive on

1045
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,480
the other side for example

1046
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,160
um

1047
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,000
so if there is nobody

1048
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,400
yeah sorry go ahead

1049
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,240
yeah there's this there's no like a

1050
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,319
global

1051
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,720
entity that kind of

1052
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,400
handles synchronization of these two

1053
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,079
nodes

1054
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,380
so it's kind of like

1055
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,480
[Music]

1056
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,359
running at one node we'll have

1057
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,000
its quantum connection and then it'll uh

1058
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
to the actual qpu and then it will have

1059
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,720
just an ordinary tcp socket or something

1060
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,200
that connects to to the to the uh

1061
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,119
the uh the other application in your

1062
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,160
distributed computation

1063
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,040
yeah indeed yeah okay thanks

1064
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,640
thanks rodney shiger you're next

1065
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,400
we cannot hear you you must be muted

1066
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,800
oh you're very sorry you're very quiet

1067
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,440
we cannot hear you

1068
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,440
no i still cannot hear you

1069
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,520
are you muted or is your microphone very

1070
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,520
quiet

1071
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
can the remote people hear shigea sorry

1072
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,480
because okay sorry i cannot hear you on

1073
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,720
site

1074
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,280
i cannot

1075
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,280
hear them

1076
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,480
we cannot hear your question

1077
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,760
no can't hear him

1078
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,200
while you're trying to resolve that if

1079
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,960
your question's uh

1080
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,880
straightforward enough can can you just

1081
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,040
type it in the uh in the chat

1082
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,839
and and then we'll get bart to answer it

1083
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,359
while shige is doing that why tech you

1084
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,200
want to you want to

1085
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,040
roll on to

1086
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,160
there's no one else in the queue at the

1087
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,799
moment right

1088
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,720
uh now uh so in the meantime does

1089
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,960
anybody else have any questions for bart

1090
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,119
before whilst we let you guys write his

1091
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,119
question

1092
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,839
slash wrap up

1093
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,440
all right so there's shiges question uh

1094
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,760
are you sending the net chasm routine

1095
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,119
every time the app player calls the qpu

1096
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,280
as in i think are you sending the uh

1097
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,520
sending the uh

1098
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,079
the code from the app layer to the cpu

1099
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,800
for every

1100
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,040
or every call to the qpu i guess that's

1101
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,520
the question

1102
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,200
um

1103
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
yes yes we do

1104
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,240
um

1105
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,560
so maybe the question is uh

1106
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,800
there's maybe an alternative that you

1107
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
were thinking of is that the all the net

1108
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,880
customer routines were already in some

1109
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,680
kind of memory on the qpu

1110
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,920
so the cases here is that

1111
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,520
these net custom routines the actual

1112
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,040
contents of them they might depend on

1113
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,760
things like values that

1114
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,640
come up only at runtime so for example

1115
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,880
only at runtime you might get a message

1116
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,480
a classical message from another note

1117
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,240
saying what you should do

1118
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,119
and based on that and you should then

1119
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,319
create

1120
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,839
this netcast routine so it's not

1121
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,079
maybe not always possible to already

1122
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,160
create all your net custom routines

1123
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,560
beforehand

1124
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
so this is why

1125
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,599
yeah

1126
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,400
in the diagram on this same page there

1127
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,079
at the left it says

1128
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,160
send the netchasm routine from the app

1129
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,319
layer to to the qbu

1130
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,560
and then toward the right the next pair

1131
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,720
of arrows it says the same thing

1132
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,119
so what above where it says classical

1133
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,200
computation communication

1134
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,280
there might be some some adaptation and

1135
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,800
some change to the code that's actually

1136
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,200
going to be downloaded is that the uh

1137
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,880
is that the model

1138
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,079
yeah

1139
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,400
correct

1140
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,040
okay

1141
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,839
does that answer your

1142
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,800
question he said thanks i guess that

1143
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,040
means yes

1144
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,839
okay yeah but thanks for your question

1145
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,119
okay

1146
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,800
thanks uh it looks like we don't have

1147
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,560
any more questions so thanks a lot for

1148
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,319
your presentation bart

1149
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,400
uh that was great

1150
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,240
uh and uh now let's uh

1151
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,599
we have uh an open floor session um we

1152
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,800
kind of don't really have anything

1153
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,560
scheduled but this is kind of the time

1154
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,400
we have 15 minutes

1155
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,280
uh to just throw ideas around i put one

1156
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,240
item

1157
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,680
on the

1158
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,960
um

1159
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,319
chair size but we don't have to actually

1160
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,839
stick to it

1161
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,040
um

1162
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,960
let me just find it

1163
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,920
oh

1164
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,680
well i've sticked it so bart presented

1165
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,599
the quantum network explorer that is an

1166
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,200
educational platform but one of the

1167
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,000
things uh that

1168
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,839
as bart said might happen in the future

1169
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,240
is connecting it to real hardware

1170
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,160
so kind of here's a feature request

1171
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,000
essentially uh to the qrg um

1172
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,280
yeah

1173
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,480
oh just like see we don't have to talk

1174
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,800
about this anything else is open floor

1175
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,560
and rodney's already in the queue so

1176
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,960
rodney would you like to start

1177
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,359
yeah actually this this actually sort of

1178
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,520
goes back to the use case um draft

1179
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,200
one of the questions that i brought up

1180
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,200
on on the the mailing list was um

1181
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,440
the use of the word transmit in the

1182
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,560
draft

1183
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,960
and i want to get away from from the use

1184
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,200
of transmit as much as possible because

1185
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,040
because the uh

1186
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,800
it really implies to a lot of people

1187
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,040
that we're we're encoding some data on

1188
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,800
on a photon and sending it from place to

1189
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,520
place and whether or not and that

1190
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,440
photons actually carrying that important

1191
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,560
data

1192
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,680
whereas for a lot of

1193
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,440
our purposes in a lot of the programming

1194
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,599
model including what bart just presented

1195
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,960
the network layer service is actually

1196
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,200
creation of end-to-end entanglement

1197
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,599
which then gets used and sometimes it's

1198
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,640
used for transmitting um

1199
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,800
or exchanging information from one place

1200
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,160
to another

1201
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,240
is there another word we can use besides

1202
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,559
transmit i feel i feel like it leads

1203
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,520
people in the wrong direction on this so

1204
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
i'm not i'm not yet prescribing i'm i'm

1205
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,599
asking for other discussion what people

1206
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,880
think about that choice of word

1207
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,720
uh security is your handwriting for this

1208
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,200
question or for our next one no okay

1209
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,319
uh

1210
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,040
yeah so does anybody have anything to

1211
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,640
answer to rodney's question

1212
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,319
somebody in the chat just said plus one

1213
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,079
entanglement robin wilson said plus one

1214
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,359
entanglement means that we need new

1215
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,480
language

1216
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,440
but does not have a suggestion

1217
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,440
and we generally use generate

1218
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,599
entanglement which i actually i also

1219
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,599
don't like to be honest

1220
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,119
uh because what you're really doing is

1221
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,359
you're creating entanglement

1222
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,280
you're create you're calling two qubits

1223
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,960
at two separate nodes to become

1224
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,040
entangled

1225
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,720
which i guess can be called generating

1226
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,640
entanglement but it kind of implies

1227
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,079
you're creating something from nothing

1228
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,760
which is not really the case

1229
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,079
but yeah um sometimes you do transmit

1230
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,359
data when you're teleporting a cube but

1231
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,839
you do transmit the data

1232
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,280
yeah so so

1233
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,760
i think i maybe didn't say it as clearly

1234
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,680
you know so the use cases that they're

1235
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,160
talking about they are talking about

1236
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,440
you know at least the paragraph i was

1237
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,640
looking at a few minutes ago um

1238
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,800
moving data from one node to another but

1239
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,880
that can be done either by encoding it

1240
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,800
on something and transmitting it or by

1241
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,040
teleporting it and so i think we need a

1242
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,640
word that says

1243
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,800
we don't care what mechanism you use for

1244
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,480
for moving the data from one place to

1245
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,240
another but but for this particular

1246
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,640
application the data gets moved from a

1247
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,599
to b

1248
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,119
and then maybe from b to a after you're

1249
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,319
done with some computation or not but

1250
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,960
so either transmit or teleport i think

1251
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,280
carry carries baggage that's a little

1252
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,480
more uh

1253
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,680
a little more specific than what we want

1254
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,000
dave's suggestion in the uh in the chat

1255
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,040
there uh says state synchronization

1256
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,160
um

1257
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,040
but i'm not sure

1258
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,800
state synchronization is one of the

1259
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,839
things you can do with with entanglement

1260
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,000
for example but that's still not quite

1261
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,200
getting the

1262
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,359
move data from point a to point b via

1263
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,880
some mechanism that might or might not

1264
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,319
be transmitting

1265
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,599
yeah

1266
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,839
uh okay um

1267
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,680
i suggest people said through a

1268
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,160
suggestion of the chat and i'll let uh

1269
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,920
curity it's because we only have 10

1270
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,599
minutes so i need to try to get through

1271
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,119
as much as we can

1272
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,359
kiriti and a reminder can you say your

1273
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,200
name we ask you a question

1274
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,920
you've said it twice but hiriti here

1275
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,480
um it's an open question um

1276
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,400
is there research going on on

1277
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,119
distributed

1278
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,839
computing distributed quantum computing

1279
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,200
and things like um if i need you know

1280
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,160
100 qubits for a certain computation

1281
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,400
on a single node but if i now can

1282
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
distribute it over two nodes or five

1283
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,680
nodes

1284
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,920
how much do i need per node so maybe i

1285
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,400
still need more than 100

1286
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,960
qubits to do the computation but on any

1287
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,040
given node i only need 10

1288
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,640
so i'm actually in a better place

1289
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,319
because i can't build a computer with

1290
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,520
100 nodes that i mean 100 qubits that

1291
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,880
kind of

1292
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,319
research

1293
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,000
where

1294
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,920
the ability to actually entangle between

1295
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,119
nodes

1296
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,920
reduces the per node requirement of how

1297
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,240
many qubits you need

1298
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,079
does that make any sense

1299
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,839
uh it makes perfect sense to me and i do

1300
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,839
have an answer

1301
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,200
but i want to see if somebody else wants

1302
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,160
to chip in before i do

1303
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,760
so i might as well say yes there is

1304
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,960
research going to distribute quantum

1305
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,520
computing in fact

1306
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,440
the department i work at is that is

1307
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,040
called quantum internet and network

1308
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,720
computing where the network computing is

1309
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,559
specifically to address distributed

1310
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,839
computing

1311
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,559
uh this is ongoing work in progress a

1312
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,960
very crucial difference between quantum

1313
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,800
internet and what we call network

1314
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,920
computing or distributed quantum

1315
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,640
computing is i mean same in as in

1316
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,240
classical computing you can globally

1317
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,599
orchestrate if you're distributing

1318
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,000
computing so at this stage it's

1319
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,359
currently very different lines of

1320
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,760
research and a big challenge in

1321
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,079
distributed quantum computing that i see

1322
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,839
and i hear from colleagues

1323
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,160
is that it's not immediately obvious how

1324
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,000
one can distribute a quantum computation

1325
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,599
over multiple nodes

1326
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,760
it's not exactly a trivial thing

1327
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,520
because it's a big question as to what

1328
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,119
what is the resource through which you

1329
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,280
distribute do you just paralyze an

1330
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,559
effort and if you paralyze is it

1331
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,319
actually giving you a gain or if you

1332
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,839
don't paralyze and you instead create

1333
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,520
entangled pairs between all of your 15

1334
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,000
nodes how do you actually use that at

1335
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,200
that point

1336
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,720
uh so all those questions are highly

1337
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,960
non-trivial and uh

1338
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,200
when i ask theorists about the status

1339
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,359
they kind of don't have a coherent

1340
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,880
answer at least none that i have heard

1341
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,760
of so yes it's ongoing work um

1342
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,520
yeah if you google you'll find quite a

1343
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,079
few few things going on

1344
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,839
i think i'd recommend looking up papers

1345
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,640
from an researcher called simon benjamin

1346
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,720
um so yeah okay thank you

1347
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,240
uh diego uh would you like to go up next

1348
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,800
was not sure if i i was uh

1349
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,319
on time

1350
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,920
there's a couple of comments one is

1351
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,920
regarding what you were mentioning here

1352
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,839
about the distributed quantum computing

1353
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:48,960
and the internet computing this is

1354
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,720
something that connects as well with uh

1355
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,520
some

1356
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,839
reflection i have the looking at the use

1357
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,839
case documents

1358
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,720
because

1359
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,800
well and it's totally normal but it's a

1360
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,280
situation in which we seem to be right

1361
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,160
now more analyzing cases for

1362
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,920
internet sorry for quantum

1363
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,440
communications

1364
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,680
rather than for the internet

1365
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,000
quantum internet for example i don't

1366
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,559
know whatever the case is is interesting

1367
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,960
that the nodes are able to communicate

1368
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,280
but then the internet is precisely about

1369
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,640
how these

1370
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,079
individual

1371
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,720
islands of communicating staff can

1372
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,520
communicate to to one another

1373
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,800
using a

1374
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,040
a uniform mechanism whatever it is i

1375
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,319
mean right now in the internet we have

1376
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,240
ip and we have the transfer protocols

1377
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,079
and and that's it

1378
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:36,880
that

1379
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,359
step is something that well it's a it's

1380
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,800
still a challenge and i say no saying

1381
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,400
that is a solution but this is something

1382
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,000
that probably

1383
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,240
is a twist that we should have in the

1384
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,680
use case document this is something i

1385
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,839
was taking note because i had to to

1386
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,359
elaborate this something that came to my

1387
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,200
mind what look in the

1388
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,880
the second thing is

1389
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,920
regarding what bad was presenting in a

1390
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,480
certain moment he i i saw this sort of

1391
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,920
the transport

1392
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,040
layer

1393
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,760
uh overstrike that

1394
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,000
and precisely what

1395
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,720
these languages advocating is precisely

1396
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,000
for using a transport layer

1397
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,079
what i mean is that

1398
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,839
the the language that you

1399
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,520
asm assume that you don't care about you

1400
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,839
have an identifier that connects you to

1401
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,400
the to the other

1402
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,559
uh to the other nodes and you don't care

1403
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,960
whether you're using uh teleportation

1404
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,880
transmission or whatever characteristic

1405
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,280
whatever and this is it may be used as

1406
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,839
precisely what the transfer layer

1407
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,799
provides so

1408
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:42,400
it is not that the qsm eliminates the

1409
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,240
need for the the transport ladder is

1410
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,640
that precisely it requires the use of a

1411
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,880
control of a transfer layer to support

1412
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,640
the computational model

1413
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,440
yes

1414
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,040
i actually do have a comment about that

1415
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,040
because it's my fault it's crossed out

1416
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,040
and

1417
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,880
it's uh it's not so much that there is

1418
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,480
no need for a transport layer it's more

1419
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,640
an indication that we don't have one uh

1420
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,720
it was suggested but we just have never

1421
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,000
got around to thinking about what to

1422
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,520
actually do in it the reason it

1423
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,680
originally said cuba teleportation but a

1424
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,040
lot of quantum network applications

1425
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,720
don't need to teleport data they

1426
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,400
actually just use entangled pairs

1427
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,119
straight away as their resource

1428
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,040
so but now there might be a need in the

1429
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,720
future it's just

1430
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,359
not well defined uh so actually that

1431
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:27,200
might be something to think about in qrs

1432
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,799
what what could be a transport layer

1433
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,720
because it's it's it's not it's

1434
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,480
definitely not a trivial translation of

1435
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,599
the classical transport layer

1436
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,280
but as you pointed out there might be

1437
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,240
some

1438
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,160
need for such a layer or we should start

1439
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,000
thinking about quantum sockets or

1440
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,720
whatever that's uh that's yeah yeah but

1441
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,640
while you were talking i was trying to

1442
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,400
figure out whether

1443
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,880
acute teleportation could be a one kind

1444
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,720
of udp and

1445
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,880
other mechanisms could be like tcp i

1446
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,280
don't know what's just fantasizing not

1447
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,000
so that i'm saying anything just to to

1448
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,520
start thinking about it

1449
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,400
thank you

1450
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,559
all right thanks

1451
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,160
we have five minutes as a reminder so

1452
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,839
rodney is used to again in the queue or

1453
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,200
did you just never put your hand down

1454
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,240
okay

1455
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,040
[Music]

1456
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,200
there is actually a question on the chat

1457
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,480
uh pretty kind there uh that i have seen

1458
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,319
from bruno i've seen pretty kind of

1459
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,119
demos on q a but is it also possible

1460
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,640
will also be possible to submit my

1461
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,200
netcast for execution cuny

1462
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,119
yes and bart said yes

1463
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,000
it's work in progress

1464
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,839
okay um

1465
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,880
anybody else have any questions we have

1466
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,040
four minutes so if not we will just wrap

1467
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,119
up

1468
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,319
rodney

1469
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,160
i'll just uh

1470
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,160
echo what i just actually wrote in the

1471
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,760
in the chat um

1472
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,680
the discussion about transport protocol

1473
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,480
is actually a good one and uh

1474
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,920
that's an area where it would be really

1475
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,960
nice to get input from

1476
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,640
my group and from the delft group and

1477
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,240
from other groups and sort of

1478
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,599
collaboratively figure out what a

1479
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,760
transport protocol ought to be and so

1480
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,240
maybe eqr qirg would be a good place to

1481
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,680
actually do that work

1482
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,880
um

1483
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,200
but that would require somebody actually

1484
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,319
uh stepping up and

1485
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,079
planning to actually lead and organize

1486
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,680
such a thing so

1487
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,599
every all the participants here should

1488
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,799
think about that

1489
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,359
what do we want qrg to do to do next and

1490
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:34,720
would you be willing to lead such an

1491
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
effort

1492
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,559
uh yeah it'll be uh

1493
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,160
it'll be great you didn't of work for

1494
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,240
qrg uh i've got a bunch of thoughts but

1495
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,799
it's not something i or q-tech i think

1496
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,040
will be working directly on anytime soon

1497
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,200
so it's i think it's something great to

1498
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,040
discuss if somebody else wants to pick

1499
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,279
this up

1500
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,079
okay uh without any more questions uh i

1501
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,920
will then close the session and thank

1502
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,839
all the attendees both online and remote

1503
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,599
and thank our speakers

1504
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,200
and people who ask questions so thank

1505
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,839
you everybody

1506
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,279
thanks

1507
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,520
all bruno thanks for doing the uh the

1508
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,839
notes

1509
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,200
oh yeah thanks bruno

1510
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,000
stay safe everybody looking forward to

1511
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,280
seeing you all in person sometime

1512
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:23,760
thank soon

1513
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,839
you
