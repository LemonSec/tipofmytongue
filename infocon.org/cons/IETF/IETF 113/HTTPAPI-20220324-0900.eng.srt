00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,479
the http api

31
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,000
um by now

32
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,520
you should be

33
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,560
many people will be familiar with

34
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
um

35
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,080
the eye chart here

36
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
no well

37
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,639
it is a set of references to

38
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,440
intellectual property

39
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,000
harassment online conduct and so on

40
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,759
if you haven't read it

41
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,120
when you signed up you should have

42
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
gotten a pointer to it so we'll assume

43
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,599
everybody has read it please be nice

44
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,280
respectful and

45
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,119
professional and kind to each other

46
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,440
in case you haven't learned this meeting

47
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,520
is being recorded

48
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,240
the tips by now or we only have a day

49
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,639
and a half left

50
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,080
everybody should be

51
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,639
signed in via meet echo apparently there

52
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,360
is a

53
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,479
qr code you can sign in if you're one of

54
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,639
the dozen or so people in the room

55
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,560
links some other resources

56
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,440
and

57
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,039
late in the week this should not be new

58
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,800
information

59
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,479
although i guess our group is a little

60
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,400
different in that we have people who are

61
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,240
not

62
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,039
full

63
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,039
regular ietf attendees

64
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
so

65
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,479
it might be useful

66
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,400
this is all in the

67
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,240
chair slides file

68
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,199
in the

69
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,599
github repository it's also on the data

70
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,080
tracker

71
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,520
agenda

72
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,800
okay so first part administration

73
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,879
uh we need one or two people to

74
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,280
volunteer to take minutes

75
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,639
that can be done in the

76
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,759
uh

77
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,879
code emd hedge dock

78
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,160
do we have any volunteers

79
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,758
i will also be online doing it

80
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,479
oh

81
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,519
you have to sign in

82
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,440
which i'm about to do anybody else

83
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,720
we got martin and mark in the chat

84
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,240
volunteering

85
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,720
great thank you people yeah when you're

86
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,959
showing slides you can't

87
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
see stuff

88
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,279
great thank you gentlemen

89
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,360
all right

90
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,160
uh we have some

91
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,600
presentation

92
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,680
of any other changes to the rest of the

93
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,480
agenda people want to talk about

94
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,880
we have presentations on

95
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,399
current documents

96
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,399
uh some status updates

97
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,640
and then there's a couple of proposals

98
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
to bring new documents into the working

99
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
group

100
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,360
uh

101
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,120
darryl mark francesca and i talked about

102
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,560
uh

103
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,440
increasing the bandwidth of the group

104
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,279
since we seem to have

105
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,760
our feet

106
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,040
under us we know what we're doing

107
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,959
uh even if it is

108
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,640
at times frustrating for some of the

109
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,160
authors we'll talk to that

110
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,320
and then finally any other business uh

111
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,839
twitter bot if there's time daryl could

112
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,920
show the github project board

113
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,599
which is very impressive

114
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,320
anybody have anything else they'd like

115
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,800
to put on the agenda

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
okay

117
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,680
that's it on the chair slides

118
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,160
which freezo you want me to bring up

119
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,560
next

120
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,920
well probably a good idea just to go in

121
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,839
the order uh so if we start with the

122
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,720
right limit headers

123
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,120
okay

124
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,600
roberto are you

125
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
ready

126
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,040
hi everybody

127
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,680
yes oh

128
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,720
we will start with the http api red

129
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,720
limit

130
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,360
can i show the screen

131
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
your slide deck

132
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,279
i have the slides if you want to share

133
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,680
the screen

134
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,640
whichever you prefer

135
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,440
uh happy to let you do it we'll

136
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,279
request to share the screen i will stop

137
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,560
so

138
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,760
so red limit headers we

139
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,800
made um we're already done uh we're

140
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
almost done with this uh

141
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,839
specification

142
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,959
there have been some changes

143
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,360
well the goal of the

144
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
of this specification is to communicate

145
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,320
service limits so clients cannot stop

146
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,240
before being throttled out

147
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,440
can stop before being traveled out

148
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,639
align

149
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,240
all the already existing red limit

150
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,560
headers so we are not inventing

151
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
anything new

152
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
we are just trying to

153
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,079
standardize something that is already

154
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,839
existing our or an already existing

155
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,800
practice and

156
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,399
we want to express

157
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,000
multiple rate limiting policies

158
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,399
so

159
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,760
we want to stop header proliferation

160
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,279
we are

161
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,360
the current setup is that

162
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,040
we have three

163
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,399
fields

164
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,880
the red limit limit that is a structured

165
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
field list now

166
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,360
uh as red limit remaining and red limit

167
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,440
reset data structure

168
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,560
structure fields uh integrals

169
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
one providing the number of units

170
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,040
remaining to be consumed and the last

171
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,000
one are delta seconds just light

172
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
recreate

173
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,639
so this is the current setup with

174
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,639
structure fields before

175
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,480
the

176
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
that are were implemented in this

177
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,600
version

178
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,920
so we have three integrals varied items

179
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,959
and then

180
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,519
in the case of red limit limit

181
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,720
we have

182
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,320
optional values

183
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,760
conveying

184
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,920
the quarter

185
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,399
so the technical choices are to support

186
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,639
only delta seconds just like we try

187
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,320
after

188
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,880
this avoids issues with with ntp skew

189
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,079
and adjustment issues and now we support

190
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,680
structure fields

191
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,760
there is a flexible semantic and we

192
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,920
don't mention infrastructure concepts

193
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,800
like connection

194
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,040
changes from the version were the

195
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,079
now we are using structure fields

196
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,680
this may need some editorial work uh to

197
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,120
align with the

198
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,680
latest

199
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,639
way of expressing

200
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,519
structure fields the latest pros

201
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,399
that is going to be used in

202
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,480
http

203
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,320
extensions documents

204
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,600
we

205
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,720
resolve the field dependencies

206
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,519
so after a long discussion we state that

207
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,560
rate limit limit and reset are required

208
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
while red limited remaining is

209
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,120
recommended

210
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,160
and we fix another issue saying that

211
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,519
protein scope is eventually delegated to

212
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,079
uh parameters

213
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,480
that can be further registered in a yana

214
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,839
table i am a table

215
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,240
martin

216
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,800
the fact that those fields are required

217
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
means that if you want to be

218
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,920
interoperable

219
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,519
with respect to this specification

220
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,480
you

221
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,320
always need to

222
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
reply with those fields

223
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,600
so we are not saying that

224
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,199
all http server must implement this

225
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,279
specification but if you implement this

226
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,880
specification

227
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,360
since the goal is interoperability

228
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,000
between servers and client clients will

229
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
expect

230
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,279
those fields to be present

231
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,160
to

232
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,639
enable actions

233
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,920
so

234
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,079
of an issue needing input

235
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,680
the first is we had some uh

236
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,880
requests

237
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,320
from users to separate quota policies

238
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,480
from experiment limits

239
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,600
and

240
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,839
me and alex the other editor

241
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,759
are supportive of

242
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,680
of these changes

243
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,240
this because some implementers say

244
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,279
that they prefer to

245
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,800
separate those information

246
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,759
because it's much simpler to implement

247
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,560
the the behavior

248
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,959
the arrow is pretty er should be

249
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,160
credited

250
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,279
to

251
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,120
lucas

252
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
perdue

253
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,279
that

254
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,199
invented this

255
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,400
is arrow

256
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,359
uh

257
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,720
the upper uh the second of an issue is

258
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,679
do we want to define an upper bound for

259
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,359
it limit reset

260
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,000
or not since it's a delta second

261
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,400
maybe we could suggest to implementer

262
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,640
that if they receive a

263
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,799
incredibly huge number

264
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,359
on this red limit reset

265
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,410
probably

266
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,760
[Music]

267
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
they shouldn't wait

268
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
all that time

269
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,240
and

270
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
maybe the

271
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,840
those red limit research should be

272
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,480
either ignored or interpreted in another

273
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,760
way

274
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,400
and there was a

275
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,080
last of an issue about field names

276
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,520
uh

277
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,600
[Music]

278
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,200
we me and alex discussed this a lot

279
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,320
alex

280
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,880
is one of the editors and

281
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,640
is one of the

282
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,960
leading engineer from the redox

283
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
api gateway

284
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,799
that implements with kong and then by

285
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,880
proxy

286
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,559
this specification

287
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,679
and

288
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,880
the

289
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
our um

290
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
opinion is that

291
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,960
we shouldn't

292
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,880
modify the field names because we

293
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,600
adopted field names that were very

294
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,200
similar to the one

295
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,600
api gateways are using now

296
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,520
and we think

297
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,799
that

298
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,280
we should stick with those names

299
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,440
because those names are

300
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,559
something that is already used

301
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
well to split quarter policies means

302
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,840
that instead of having a

303
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,039
i'm moving on but um

304
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,120
so the quota policies now is that the

305
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,840
rate limit limit is a

306
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,559
a structure field list

307
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
while we've been asked to have two

308
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,679
fields

309
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,720
one

310
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,120
with red limit limit that is

311
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,919
only that only contains the first

312
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,559
field of the list the expiring limit and

313
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,760
the second one contain containing all

314
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,640
the other uh

315
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,080
um

316
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,840
quota policy

317
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,280
uh

318
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
information

319
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,559
we have been suggested that this is

320
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,360
easier to parse about confusion between

321
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,960
the expiring limit and the quota

322
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,160
policies

323
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,520
and moreover in this case all the list

324
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,640
items

325
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,600
have the same structure

326
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,400
so

327
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,679
i think this

328
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,280
this is a

329
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,360
reasonable idea

330
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,480
the

331
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,960
what we'll have then is that red limit

332
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
limit remaining a result are just three

333
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,640
bare

334
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,159
integers

335
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,640
and the optional part is in another

336
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,760
field the rate limit policies

337
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,520
containing uh

338
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,240
the

339
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
old

340
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
quad apologies and this is the only

341
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,880
feeds that support parameters

342
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
so probably um

343
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,039
[Music]

344
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,559
this is the

345
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,919
principle

346
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,880
uh

347
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,720
question

348
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,520
uh

349
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,840
and we want to ask the

350
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,039
the opinion of

351
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,799
work group on this

352
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,880
splittings part

353
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,000
we think this is reasonable

354
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,880
because it's

355
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,360
it's apple with apple and oranges with

356
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,640
oranges

357
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,520
while in the previously we had

358
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,000
different meaning for the first

359
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,840
list item and the other ones

360
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
and the rest if we want to discuss the

361
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,240
other policies

362
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
um we have uh mark in the queue do you

363
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,240
want to

364
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,159
uh take questions now or do you want to

365
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,840
wait till the end

366
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,400
afternoon

367
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,679
i'm finished actually

368
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,000
because this was a the core issue the

369
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,159
other can be discussed footer after the

370
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,080
work group plus call but if we close

371
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,120
this

372
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,280
we will make the

373
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,159
requests and then we we hope to make our

374
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,880
group let's go

375
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,240
so i'll hand it over to you mark

376
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
working

377
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,480
can you hear me

378
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,320
yes wow

379
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,280
technology is wonderful hello um

380
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,960
so i did to me this seems like

381
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,679
we're seeing this proliferation of

382
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,600
fields

383
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,240
and it seems like it's quite verbose

384
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
you know sometimes it's a good idea to

385
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,080
split out data into multiple fields

386
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,600
especially when it changes at different

387
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
rates

388
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,440
um but it seems like

389
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,640
you know like the remaining and the

390
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,120
reset are pretty dynamic as far as i'm

391
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,360
aware whereas the policy and the limit

392
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,520
are not

393
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
um

394
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,440
so i i just i can't help but wonder you

395
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,760
know this is maybe related to issue 65

396
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,679
as well i can't help but wonder have we

397
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,880
tried to

398
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
combine all this

399
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
information into one field like a

400
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,080
dictionary

401
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,880
and use clear dictionary labels to to

402
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,320
clarify the relationship because it's

403
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,640
all fairly tightly coupled it seems to

404
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,840
me

405
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,440
i was just wondering if if the editors

406
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
considered that

407
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,400
we did but

408
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,799
the point is that

409
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,919
this is

410
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,320
what is already used

411
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,840
by everyone

412
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,120
on the internet this is what everybody

413
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,400
does

414
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,440
and

415
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,320
that paving cow paths is is a good

416
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,919
strategy sometimes

417
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
but i don't think we should be bound by

418
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
it i think that

419
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,919
developers if it with a clear

420
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,440
specification and a clear direction

421
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,520
forward can change we're already

422
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,960
changing the names of the fields that

423
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,320
they're using

424
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
i found the reasoning for issue 65 quite

425
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,880
thin on that basis that if we don't have

426
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
it starting with the words right limit

427
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,760
they won't understand it seems to be the

428
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,679
reasoning there um

429
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,240
so i i think that if if we come up with

430
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
a well-reasoned design we don't have to

431
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,679
be too

432
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,480
bound by by precedent there um and i'd

433
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,640
encourage you to to at least explore

434
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,799
those directions

435
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
thanks mark we actually did

436
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,880
talking with implementers

437
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
there does not see

438
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,520
we after our investigation it seems that

439
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,039
implementers

440
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,480
not only

441
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,200
are um

442
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,039
not willing to change the this layout

443
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,840
but when we try to conflate policy and

444
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,520
limit

445
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,640
they expressly provide feedback in

446
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,120
splitting them

447
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,240
so

448
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,600
maybe uh

449
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,240
i i wouldn't

450
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,480
it wouldn't be useful to create a cool

451
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,440
specification that implementers are not

452
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,559
willing

453
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,240
to use

454
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,720
that's it

455
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,240
at least this is the thing that we have

456
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,720
okay i i i would love to probe that a

457
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,200
bit more because it sounds

458
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,799
somewhat thin to me

459
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,919
um that

460
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,200
that

461
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,720
the implementers want to see it spelled

462
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,919
in a particular way in particular

463
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,200
headers in the wire otherwise they're

464
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
never going to use it

465
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,760
that seems a bit odd to me

466
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,678
martin's joined the queue martin

467
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,440
um

468
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,000
so i tend to agree with rocky i think

469
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,159
the uh efficiency advantages that you

470
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,640
get from having a single field

471
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,240
sort of far outweigh the

472
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,159
advantages of having simple unique

473
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,360
um

474
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,120
fields that you can pull out with simple

475
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,159
images

476
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,080
uh it's

477
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,360
the assumption here we're using

478
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
structured fields

479
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,440
for pathing these things out and my

480
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,200
guess is that those implementers who

481
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,000
would

482
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,679
rather we didn't put all the things

483
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,880
together

484
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,240
are

485
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,000
not using structured fields to do their

486
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,760
path in which

487
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
it's probably

488
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,480
okay maybe if you're just using a simple

489
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,559
integer field but these things can be

490
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
parameterized and there's no guarantee

491
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,159
that they won't be

492
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
and so i i tend to think that pushing

493
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,760
them towards a dictionary would be

494
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,200
pretty straightforward

495
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,760
the um the dynamism aspect of that can

496
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,400
be pretty well addressed with header

497
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,760
compression

498
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,559
and

499
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,080
i

500
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,799
think it's much more compact and concise

501
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,120
to have a simple a single break limit

502
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,600
thing that sort of says well here's one

503
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,919
parameter one one pair of values here's

504
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,360
the limit here's the reset here's the

505
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,320
remaining

506
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,640
and um i don't know how to express a

507
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,360
policy but i'm sure

508
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,279
thanks marty

509
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,360
does anybody have questions on other

510
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,440
parts of this

511
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,080
presentation

512
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,640
okay this is rich so i'll mention

513
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,400
that um

514
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
in the oblivious http

515
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,159
group

516
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,200
um

517
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
the idea came up

518
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,799
um and i don't know if the people there

519
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,720
had reached out to you

520
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,919
uh or your author's co-author robert um

521
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,399
the idea that so in ohi

522
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,200
there's an intermediate proxy between

523
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,279
the end user and the client and the

524
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,640
origin server and that obfuscates enough

525
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
information and it gets obfuscated

526
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,080
information so we can't tell what the

527
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,000
request is and it sends it on to the

528
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,039
origin

529
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,279
and there seems to be a need

530
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,039
for

531
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,080
having

532
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,720
that intermediate and the origin

533
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,080
collaborate to do rate limiting

534
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,880
uh one way or another and so

535
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,200
they might be coming here or they might

536
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,279
be looking at your draft as a way to

537
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,679
reuse some of it and probably adding

538
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,000
some kind of indicators saying

539
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,720
this is related to the origin or this is

540
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,919
related to the proxy or this should go

541
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,480
back to the user whoever they are

542
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,799
saying you're doing too many requests of

543
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,399
this kind

544
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,240
the proxy has no idea what the requests

545
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,960
are

546
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,000
but

547
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,760
it can be you can tell the the

548
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,960
the client

549
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,880
you know stop asking for every single

550
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,760
picture in the phone book

551
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,799
so i think it's mainly just a heads up

552
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,320
that uh

553
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,440
ojai

554
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
needs a similar kind of thing it's

555
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,600
different in that there's multi multiple

556
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,640
parties

557
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,720
and they'll need to

558
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,200
be able to address

559
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,120
where the limits are intended it might

560
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,520
just be as simple as adding a new field

561
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,760
indicating which party the limits are

562
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,799
encoders are for

563
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,159
that's all just a heads up

564
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,360
frank this is

565
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
this is interesting and

566
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,480
probably we should file an issue to

567
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,960
understand better

568
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,279
the use case and possible exchanges

569
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,559
in

570
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:22,080
in general i am well i understand uh

571
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,440
the

572
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,200
suggestion of

573
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,720
reducing the number of fields

574
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
but please consider that the actual

575
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,960
feedback of many implementers

576
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,880
is that they say

577
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
in direct limit policy that they don't

578
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080
even want to conflate all those

579
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
information in the same field and they

580
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,279
prefer to say for example red limit

581
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,279
minions that limit our different things

582
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,679
i don't know if this is because they

583
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,960
implement this at different layers so

584
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,120
they have different proxies

585
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,919
or different intermediator

586
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,440
that provides

587
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,279
each different

588
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,919
time frame

589
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,399
no i'm i'm i'm not using i'm not

590
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,720
the i'm not trying to avoid using

591
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,480
structure-filled parser but i need

592
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,399
i i'm building this specification for

593
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,080
implementers

594
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,480
and my goal is not forcing them to do

595
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
something they don't want to do

596
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
but is avoiding they

597
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,720
to provide different

598
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,480
the same information in different things

599
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,480
i i i'm not uh i mean uh

600
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,840
trying to

601
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,159
interpret

602
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,360
what they

603
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,799
um

604
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,760
that their goals i'm trying to

605
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,000
i'm trying to make them use the same

606
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,159
field name for sending the same

607
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,799
information

608
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,679
mark is back in the queue all right go

609
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,679
ahead

610
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,559
working is it working yes it seems to be

611
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,840
working okay

612
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,600
um so roberto i think it's great that

613
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,519
you're going out and engaging with folks

614
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,559
who are using you know similar things

615
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,000
out there and

616
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,200
i mean

617
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,880
implementers potential implementers i

618
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,159
think there's maybe a mix there i'm not

619
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,039
sure

620
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,480
but uh generally when we do that um it

621
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,240
it's great but it's important to make

622
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,120
sure that we're doing that to bring back

623
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,840
uh their feedback in the form of

624
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
arguments not just preferences you know

625
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,120
it's it's much more convincing if you

626
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,200
came back and said implementers want to

627
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,960
do this and there there's this technical

628
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,080
or this this reason why that we can

629
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,519
understand and take into account in our

630
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,840
discussions but it's it's less useful

631
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,480
when when they come back and say

632
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,640
they want to or they prefer this or they

633
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,120
prefer that um i'm much less willing to

634
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,799
be convinced that that that's a good

635
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,960
reason to choose any particular design

636
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,240
in the discussions for a standard

637
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,880
the problem is

638
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,799
to find something that

639
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,000
matches

640
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,080
the

641
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,200
that can

642
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,480
be accepted by

643
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,200
bad implementers

644
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,279
i mean

645
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,919
part of the challenge of writing

646
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,399
standards yes i think we're maybe we

647
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,559
have different calibrations on what

648
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,279
uh will work there

649
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,039
brian hello is this working yep this is

650
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,080
brian gondwana um i i wanted to add

651
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,320
something in favor of the idea that

652
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,720
something that people want to use

653
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,480
has value in itself not just because of

654
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,640
the technical arguments but because they

655
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,159
enjoy using it and hence they're more

656
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,480
likely to use it we're competing against

657
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,919
someone can throw whatever they like in

658
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,760
the header if we're offering them a

659
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,840
standard that's a pain to use and looks

660
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,679
ugly and they don't like then they just

661
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,600
won't use it so i think

662
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,720
the

663
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,360
operators prefer this is a significant

664
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,000
users prefer this is sufficient argument

665
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,399
in itself it doesn't have to be it's

666
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,399
technically the best and and they have

667
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,080
made a compelling argument for why it's

668
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,320
right just they would prefer it is a

669
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,200
pretty strong argument

670
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,600
eric

671
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,000
yeah um

672
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,039
hello everybody this is eric um

673
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,840
so i i just wanted to point out that

674
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,519
maybe sometimes we also have a different

675
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,960
view on

676
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,440
the people we're designing for i think

677
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,120
and i really don't mean this in a

678
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
negative way but i think mark has a

679
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,159
perspective that is a lot on people who

680
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,559
are very professionally working with

681
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,279
http and http header fields and so forth

682
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,279
because that is the core

683
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,640
of what they're working with and for

684
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,719
those i would assume they should and

685
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,359
probably will be much more willing to

686
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,199
adapt to technologies like structured

687
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,800
fields and make sure they understand

688
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,239
what it means and how they can use it

689
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,159
and use the library and so forth but i

690
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,239
think in the api space really in the end

691
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,079
what you end up with is you end up with

692
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,480
a lot of developers who are not core

693
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,480
http developers who are using http as

694
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,800
part of the work they need to get done

695
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,359
and if you tell them

696
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,520
that they have to use an additional

697
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,918
parser and that there are rather complex

698
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,679
header fields to work with and all of

699
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,079
this i think it's just a different kind

700
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,760
of

701
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,119
client base we're working with here so i

702
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,119
i just think we should take into account

703
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,480
that from an http api perspective for

704
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,320
most people they are not

705
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,639
http experts

706
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,960
so for them http is just something that

707
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,280
they need of as part of the work they're

708
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,640
trying to get done

709
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,119
so we sh we should try to make it as

710
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,280
easy for them as we can

711
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,160
to get the information that they can get

712
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,800
in http and to work with http header

713
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,160
fields without

714
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,400
requiring them to

715
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,280
adapt technologies that may may be

716
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,520
designed for a different user population

717
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,000
thank you eric martin

718
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,720
oh wow okay

719
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,560
um

720
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,040
i think probably the thing

721
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,760
that tips me towards saying that using

722
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,560
structured fields properly here is

723
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,720
is acceptable is that

724
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,079
report guns

725
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,240
that those casual developers

726
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,160
have in front of them

727
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,000
is is much more than they think they

728
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,930
have and

729
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,640
[Music]

730
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,760
usability is not necessarily um

731
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,440
very different when you look at uh

732
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,800
restructuring this

733
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,440
as a single structured header uh you you

734
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,920
take the hyphen and you turn it into a

735
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,079
colon and you take the colon and you

736
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,640
turn it into an equal sign and you have

737
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,000
essentially what um

738
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,680
what we were talking about using using

739
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,839
structured fields for it's not that

740
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,680
complicated to parse

741
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,640
um

742
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,240
it's certainly

743
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,079
no no more difficult to use than what

744
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,079
what roberto has described

745
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,040
and

746
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,079
you really don't want to have a

747
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,720
situation where people think

748
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,079
they can

749
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,200
just

750
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,720
i would just throw

751
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,640
cars in or something in here

752
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,240
because that's led to a number of

753
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
problems that we've had in the past

754
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,280
and as much as i think the professional

755
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,119
uh casual thing is important here

756
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,079
um we want to make the casual people use

757
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,640
the structure for your powers as well

758
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,839
we want everyone to be using the

759
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,680
structure of your partners because those

760
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,640
are the ones that are safe

761
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,040
mark

762
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,640
oh the graph is moving you can probably

763
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,760
hear me now

764
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,960
um

765
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,560
eric i really don't buy it sorry um

766
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,119
people who who have to parse hp headers

767
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,720
by hand are exactly what we want to

768
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,480
avoid with this

769
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,240
and and having those parameters there

770
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,599
like the w on the screen that just went

771
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,079
away for some reason is is the huge kind

772
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,599
of foot gun that martin's talking about

773
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,480
um

774
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,359
if

775
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,680
you know and and and frankly making them

776
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,200
just straight integers like this but

777
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,280
still structured fields is

778
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,560
encouraging people to write their own

779
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,160
parsers and then they'll break when

780
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,920
people put it on a parameter on it later

781
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,640
so i i don't buy it um structured fields

782
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,160
is designed exactly so that people can

783
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
just go off and use a library off the

784
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,359
shelf and not worry about any of this

785
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,520
and api developers love using libraries

786
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,920
that's that's their heart and soul so

787
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,960
yeah

788
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,560
um

789
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
and and i actually got a key to respond

790
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,800
to braun absolutely if we get feedback

791
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,520
that that implementers and users prefer

792
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,760
one thing that's great i'm just i'm a

793
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,440
little concerned about one person going

794
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
off and coming back and making decisions

795
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
based only on that person's interaction

796
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,560
with the community i would expect

797
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,240
broader input

798
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,479
that's all

799
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,680
and speaking as an individual eric i

800
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,280
will both agree with you and disagree

801
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,280
with you um i i do agree that in your

802
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,960
characterization of a lot of api

803
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,079
developers

804
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,040
but most api developers are also not

805
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,400
implementing

806
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,480
the throttling infrastructure they're

807
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,079
going to use some kind of library i

808
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,000
think people we need to convince people

809
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,680
writing

810
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,079
throttling libraries and at that point

811
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,400
it's the people serving the headers that

812
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,880
are making decisions the consumers will

813
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,960
use whatever they're given

814
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,040
um and hopefully they'll use library to

815
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,119
go do that parsing um so i i i

816
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,880
i think

817
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,359
i i am concerned that it's the yeah we

818
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,480
just don't want to change our thing

819
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,320
that's using x dash and if you make

820
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,760
things very very different it'll be

821
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,119
obvious that we're not using the

822
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,200
standard thing anymore

823
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,400
um

824
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,079
so i i definitely would like to hear us

825
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,839
dig in more

826
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,160
into the pushback on making any changes

827
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,598
and having backward compatibility

828
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,000
hands

829
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,040
yep uh hi this is hunter speaking um so

830
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,960
first of all i very much a preacher

831
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,560
appreciates it works so i think this is

832
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,880
something very useful uh once it is

833
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,720
finished and in broad use

834
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,680
um i like eric's uh distinction before

835
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,520
uh regarding like there is two distinct

836
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,960
user groups like you know the casual

837
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,440
user consuming api and maybe not wanting

838
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,119
to spend so much effort

839
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,599
and more advanced users but i slightly

840
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,920
disagree with which

841
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,599
which of these users we should focus on

842
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,599
here because i think for the casual user

843
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,119
actually this doesn't matter at all in a

844
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,200
way because these users will just be

845
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,760
heart throttled by the apis if they have

846
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,839
no clue anyway so this is complex stuff

847
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,040
actually

848
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,400
and people that want to implement this

849
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,160
kind of stuff they really need to

850
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
understand not just the header fields

851
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,280
but also maybe the documentation behind

852
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,040
that so it's not just only the header

853
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,160
fields to

854
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,839
understand here and i also very much

855
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,359
agree what daryl said this is also

856
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,400
something that needs to go into

857
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,000
libraries in the end

858
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,839
um so i think it's it's very much

859
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,040
important here to have this very

860
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,119
conceptually clear and convey as much as

861
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,680
information that is necessary for

862
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,160
libraries to deal with that and yeah to

863
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,440
make stuff work smooth

864
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,440
brown

865
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,119
since i put my name into this for the

866
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,040
first thing a lot of developers are

867
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,880
going to probably just be doing a regex

868
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,400
that matches digits off the front of

869
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
rate limit remaining and not care about

870
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,079
anything else uh would be my guess

871
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,599
glancing at this

872
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,560
realistically and that's that's the use

873
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,720
case that is going to

874
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,079
be for a lot of people if they care at

875
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,280
all if they just throw things at it

876
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,960
until they get a rate limit error back

877
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,359
um which is probably what i would do

878
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,560
so

879
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,160
that's that's the kind of thing that

880
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,400
that we're really going to see with this

881
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,560
if you look at what's been done in the

882
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,319
field already i think that's a good

883
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,079
place to look at because that's what has

884
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,520
organically grown

885
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,200
and what's organically grown has been

886
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,240
separate headers rather than a

887
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,560
structured header uh it's what the

888
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,400
people who already just do stuff in this

889
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
space are going to be familiar with

890
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,200
and so i mark i totally see your point

891
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,960
who is going to do that research because

892
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,319
just saying that research needs to be

893
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,000
done with no one volunteering to do it

894
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,440
is the same as the work never happens

895
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,040
mark

896
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,760
there it is you can hear me

897
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,359
okay the lag is amazing uh

898
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,440
it sounds like that you know

899
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,400
there are two extreme solutions here

900
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,880
and i i i don't want to paint it as we

901
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,560
have to choose a or b but it sounds like

902
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,960
we might be migrating towards that at

903
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,480
one extreme we have an unlimited

904
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,280
number of fields depending on how many

905
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,640
pieces of data

906
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,720
that uh we need to send and each field

907
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,079
just has an atomic piece of data and

908
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,240
it's not structured field it's just

909
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,319
you know ten six and three literally and

910
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,680
you don't have any parameters because

911
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,040
that's too hard

912
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,839
or

913
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,760
you have a fully structured field and it

914
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,720
is you know fairly complex but we throw

915
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,160
structured fields parsers at it and the

916
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,680
data just appears

917
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,760
and uh

918
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,680
we it's we have to make it complex

919
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,760
enough to be effectively self greasing

920
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,960
which i think there's probably enough

921
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,040
data to do here if we combine it into

922
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,880
one or two fields

923
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,359
um if if it's not self grazing then i i

924
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,640
think that braun

925
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,880
you know has a point that that people

926
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,040
will just try and parse it

927
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,720
and then it'll break when somebody adds

928
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,240
some data to it like a parameter to it

929
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,440
later on

930
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,839
um so so maybe what we need to do is to

931
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,440
write up those two extremes and see what

932
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,640
they look like

933
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,880
uh there seems to be some noise there uh

934
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,560
so right up those two extremes see what

935
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,640
they look like and and figure out what

936
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,680
the best path forward is from there

937
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,720
so i i and i think we've chewed through

938
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,920
the meat of the issue i don't think

939
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,119
we're going to solve developer

940
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,000
motivation um i think it would be good

941
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,760
for us to uh take this further

942
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,240
conversation to the list and maybe we

943
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,599
can move on to uh the next presentation

944
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,359
from roberto

945
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,520
on

946
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,079
and his mind goes blank media types yes

947
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,280
there's gonna be a lot of conversation

948
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,920
on this one i fear

949
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,560
thanks so much

950
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,040
hi hi everybody i'm roberto

951
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,800
nice to meet you

952
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,760
so

953
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,000
in this specification

954
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,599
we are trying to register some media

955
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,400
types that are widely used

956
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,720
on the internet

957
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,319
and

958
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,319
but are not yet registered

959
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,000
the goal is increased interoperability

960
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,640
when processing api specification is to

961
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,560
leverage content negotiation when

962
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,280
exchange api resources and simplify

963
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,440
comparative development and cataloging

964
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,800
of api and schemes

965
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,760
so open api specification relies on

966
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,440
yammer and json schema that are not

967
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,720
being registered this makes impossible

968
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,160
uh content negotiation uh done

969
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,440
in a

970
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,119
standard way

971
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,040
and yaml users do not have

972
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,400
interoperability and security

973
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,720
considerations

974
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,640
so

975
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,960
we want to register yamalan the placing

976
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,560
ammo media type providing

977
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,839
interoperability and security

978
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,640
consideration foundation for open abi

979
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,720
plus yaml

980
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,200
registering up an api plus jason and

981
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,720
yaml json's camera plus json and yaml uh

982
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,839
jason led placiamo

983
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,520
does ingredient a

984
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,440
quick win

985
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,040
we already have onboarded

986
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,400
json schema and open avi folks

987
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,359
on plus yamo there is some

988
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,960
work needed we imported yamo fox but

989
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,079
there is uh

990
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,319
work to do

991
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,720
on ld plus yaml

992
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,400
journal defaults

993
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,680
agrees

994
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,400
but there is more quark needed and on

995
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
schema plus yaml there is some

996
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,000
disagreement

997
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,599
so

998
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,240
this is the

999
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,599
outlook we engaged with almost everybody

1000
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,839
at different degrees

1001
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,599
of

1002
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,200
interaction

1003
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,480
we have

1004
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,440
these other issues

1005
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,280
one

1006
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,760
engage with mega types mailing lists one

1007
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,599
in what group plus calls suggested by

1008
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,400
francesca thanks

1009
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,079
the third fragment identifier

1010
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,720
considerations

1011
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,480
number 22 can we use normative language

1012
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,599
in media

1013
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,079
meditab registration it seems that it is

1014
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,240
possible but

1015
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,359
i don't know so i asked for feedback

1016
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,000
here today

1017
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,400
to the to the work group

1018
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,560
there are some issues in json ld plus

1019
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,400
yaml for a set of reasons because

1020
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,839
json led seems that

1021
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,440
use the infraspecification not only the

1022
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,880
json

1023
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,560
specification

1024
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,000
and

1025
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,079
the more divisive one is

1026
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,839
do we need the json schema

1027
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,839
media type

1028
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,440
so the changes from the first

1029
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,319
revision is that

1030
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,119
it now supports json

1031
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,839
schema we added the yama structure

1032
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,599
syntax suffix

1033
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,920
and after the yaml interrupter will get

1034
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,400
security consideration with some support

1035
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,800
from the yaml

1036
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,960
folks

1037
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,720
um

1038
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,558
yes we need this the question with uh

1039
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,400
the question from martin

1040
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,359
the point of jesus schema plus

1041
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,559
is related to

1042
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,280
the open api world because of an api

1043
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,440
specification are actually developed

1044
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,920
in yaml

1045
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,960
and

1046
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,559
if i have to create a catalog

1047
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,880
with open api specification if you want

1048
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,559
to

1049
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,480
refer reference

1050
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,440
json schema

1051
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:06,559
then

1052
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,559
developers expect to

1053
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,119
develop json schema

1054
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,000
in

1055
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,640
in yaml

1056
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,760
having json schema only in jason means

1057
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,640
that folks developing yaml

1058
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,240
and then

1059
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,240
add them to catalogs in json

1060
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,799
so that

1061
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,839
api specification written in yaml can

1062
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,559
reference json schema within json

1063
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,520
and this is what

1064
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,440
is probably happening now

1065
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,839
this is not very comfortable

1066
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,760
uh reusable

1067
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,319
because why if i develop something in a

1068
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,319
language i need to

1069
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,000
convert it

1070
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,359
in

1071
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,520
another syntax

1072
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,960
to be used

1073
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,079
moreover

1074
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,800
for developers

1075
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,920
jason is very

1076
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,720
less easy to use

1077
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,359
respect to

1078
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,480
to yamo

1079
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,200
but well this is was just to present

1080
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,960
this specification i think there is a

1081
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,240
lot of work to do

1082
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,160
especially on

1083
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,800
all the impacts that yaml has

1084
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,680
on

1085
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,200
various parts

1086
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,920
of the specification

1087
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,880
and what

1088
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,839
have your thing

1089
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,240
so

1090
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,280
i read that there are some

1091
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,559
ideas

1092
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,160
i don't know if you all read this

1093
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,040
specification

1094
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,160
but

1095
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,640
the there was one comment brought up uh

1096
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,880
by martin with regards to shouldn't that

1097
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,520
application slash schema plus json b

1098
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,400
application slash json schema plus json

1099
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,680
because it feels a little like squatting

1100
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22,078
to be to call it application schema

1101
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,520
uh well i just told them from jason

1102
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,040
schema

1103
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,280
community and i

1104
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,319
didn't want to

1105
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,340
push the toes

1106
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,680
[Music]

1107
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,319
on jason schema community i'm discussing

1108
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,680
with them

1109
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,160
they will probably write the media type

1110
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,640
registration they already did

1111
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,040
so we are hosting

1112
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,839
the

1113
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,800
opinion of the json schema community for

1114
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,400
what regards the general schema

1115
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,599
mark has joined the cue mark

1116
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,839
there it goes all right i have no idea

1117
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,280
why there's so much life

1118
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,280
um so i'm not familiar with this work

1119
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,359
the only thing that i'd caution is we've

1120
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,000
had situations like this in the past

1121
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,079
where there's a draft to do some work in

1122
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,760
the itf that's

1123
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,240
related to a larger piece of work

1124
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,720
that lives somewhere else

1125
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,960
and and it's it's super super easy to

1126
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,240
get your our wires crossed when doing so

1127
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,640
so i would i would very strongly suggest

1128
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,960
that if if you're not already

1129
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,880
going through the most

1130
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,280
official liaison channel you can to do

1131
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,400
these things

1132
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,720
in other words just relying on

1133
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,720
people you know in those communities or

1134
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,640
chat on a list or something is probably

1135
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,040
not adequate you need to get

1136
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,040
the most formal possible

1137
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,640
consensus or decision or whatever the

1138
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,119
mechanism the community has that they

1139
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,720
are okay with this and they want to do

1140
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,240
it this way and they want the ietf to do

1141
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,480
this otherwise we can end up in a very

1142
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,640
very awkward situation so i'm not saying

1143
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,079
that anything wrong has been done

1144
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,640
anything i'm just from past experience

1145
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,559
uh this can bite us really hard so we we

1146
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:11,520
need to make sure we do that right

1147
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,720
that's all

1148
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,160
but but thank you for doing this work

1149
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,200
because

1150
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,800
this is the unglamorous stuff that often

1151
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,839
doesn't get done

1152
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,680
i just

1153
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,760
sorry go ahead

1154
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,400
no i was just thinking

1155
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,359
so i i can i can speak to the open api

1156
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,440
community um

1157
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,440
and the opiate api community

1158
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,960
is very much behind this effort

1159
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,000
um

1160
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,880
and

1161
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,240
this

1162
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,760
we've had conversations numerous

1163
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,240
conversations in the technical steering

1164
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,200
committee meetings uh about this so that

1165
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,119
there's definitely support there

1166
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,400
uh

1167
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,280
the jason schema community who are also

1168
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,280
actively involved with the open api it

1169
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,280
is a fairly small group of people and i

1170
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,760
know that roberto is talking to

1171
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,000
the right people um i

1172
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,079
i think we should go back to them um

1173
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,160
and suggest that applications like

1174
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,960
schema is is a little broad

1175
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,559
um

1176
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,359
and i i do think they will be receptive

1177
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,319
to that kind of feedback

1178
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,720
and it

1179
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,160
seems like um

1180
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,920
the other communities to engage in would

1181
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,520
be the link data community which i know

1182
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,760
has registered media types before

1183
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,599
and uh the yaml community of course as

1184
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,760
well

1185
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,480
martin

1186
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,160
it's only the audio

1187
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,720
i don't quite know um anyway i i was

1188
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,319
going to say

1189
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,960
my first look at this also um i was

1190
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,640
aware of its existence

1191
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,200
but um the

1192
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,559
thing that

1193
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,400
i would suggest here is that you've got

1194
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,559
a lot of media types

1195
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,559
uh in the one document and and one of

1196
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:05,599
them is

1197
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,119
this plus yaml structural syntax um

1198
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,480
suffix

1199
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,200
it might be a good idea

1200
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,000
to

1201
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,440
just slice some of these pieces off

1202
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,160
and do them as separate documents

1203
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,240
simply because

1204
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,400
i think the slide three back where you

1205
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,240
have the different color codes for the

1206
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,200
things

1207
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,520
um being at risk and and those ones that

1208
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,240
are simple and easy uh there's good risk

1209
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,559
that those things are difficult

1210
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,440
um

1211
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,359
holding back the thing the other ones

1212
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,440
and it might be nice to just get some of

1213
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,760
the easy things out of the way

1214
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,960
and and published

1215
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,160
and

1216
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,160
from a user perspective being able to

1217
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,040
cite just the plus yaml spec when you're

1218
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,280
registering your media type

1219
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,040
would be a lot easier than than trying

1220
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,839
to fish around in a big pocket of

1221
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,520
different media type registrations when

1222
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,559
you have to do something like this

1223
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,799
and just one of the call out in the

1224
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,680
media man

1225
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,000
meeting this week

1226
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,920
there was a discussion of multiple

1227
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,680
suffixes

1228
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,280
and

1229
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,799
because they're talking about wanting to

1230
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,280
be able to say plus

1231
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,359
ld plus

1232
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,720
json

1233
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,599
um

1234
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,440
on top of the application slash did so

1235
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,319
i'm

1236
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,920
not sure where that's going to land but

1237
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,240
there was some pushback

1238
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,280
in that conversation specifically around

1239
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,400
using

1240
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,599
suffixes at all so um

1241
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,720
i in in reading through the issues

1242
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,000
uh

1243
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,799
like

1244
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,680
early on when this was just focused on

1245
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,839
open api and

1246
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,119
um

1247
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,559
json scheme it seemed fairly

1248
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,480
straightforward but some of the issues

1249
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,079
seem to be opening up a bunch of stuff

1250
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,520
and sticky stuff

1251
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,480
so

1252
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,359
maybe

1253
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,400
martin's feedback is good that

1254
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,640
stopping at one point and separating out

1255
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,598
some things would be a good idea

1256
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,040
so

1257
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,720
but this is an excellent conversation

1258
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,680
and

1259
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,240
uh yeah i think it

1260
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,359
these

1261
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,680
media types have been long desired by

1262
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,040
the community

1263
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,880
so i love the fact that you're doing

1264
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,520
this work roberto

1265
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,599
yeah the goal was providing

1266
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,119
a specification where

1267
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,359
all actors

1268
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:03,760
all media that's related to the api

1269
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,319
can be addressed because i think that

1270
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,160
we need to

1271
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,920
at least to me it has been beneficial to

1272
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,559
get in touch with all those community

1273
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:17,680
together

1274
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,880
to have a better overview

1275
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,880
of the relations

1276
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,160
that there are

1277
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,480
even when people use them

1278
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,000
between all those media types

1279
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,359
martin days are not

1280
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:34,400
we don't

1281
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,520
we don't even have the yaml media

1282
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,400
so application yaml is not registered

1283
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,359
now

1284
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,160
so we are registering both application

1285
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,440
enamel and the structured syntax suffix

1286
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,319
plus yammer

1287
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,799
so if you are

1288
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:59,440
interested in martin in this yaml stuff

1289
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,640
probably

1290
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,040
we can

1291
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,839
fork this document

1292
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,480
work on the yaml stuff together

1293
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,960
in the same proposal

1294
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,839
okay so i think

1295
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,240
okay

1296
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,720
we have a volunteer erica

1297
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,319
the silence was long enough that

1298
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,799
somebody felt they should step up that's

1299
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:47,200
excellent

1300
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,760
so

1301
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,760
we will try to separate those documents

1302
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,559
and

1303
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,799
hopefully having the

1304
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,319
yaml

1305
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,799
registration

1306
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,559
uh

1307
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,280
moving on

1308
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,160
but

1309
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,119
before doing this i think

1310
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,240
i asked the church if we can get some

1311
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,520
feedback from the medium

1312
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,920
sure and it's

1313
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,440
manu uh who you have been working with

1314
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,799
uh on this uh document who's involved in

1315
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:27,599
the

1316
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,960
the

1317
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,240
multiple suffixes effort

1318
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,680
yeah

1319
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,200
so again you're talking to the right

1320
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,520
people

1321
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:46,960
there okay

1322
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,599
thank you roberto

1323
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,880
thank you for your patience

1324
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,160
thank you for yours

1325
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,400
so um we have

1326
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,520
uh we have another presentation from uh

1327
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,119
martin before we go there

1328
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,319
um

1329
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,680
i just want to quickly go through

1330
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,160
um

1331
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,079
the set of open issues on and some

1332
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,040
status across all of the documentation

1333
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,640
and i'm

1334
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,880
i'm going to

1335
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,960
be brave rich and actually try and share

1336
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,839
my screen here

1337
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,640
do you really want to share your screen

1338
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,960
yes

1339
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,160
do i want to share this screen yes

1340
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,079
and um

1341
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,599
as

1342
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,599
this working group is

1343
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:50,400
from what i understand a little unusual

1344
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,040
in that we have so many documents going

1345
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,079
through

1346
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:55,119
um

1347
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,640
in order to

1348
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,160
try and

1349
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,880
uh keep track of all of the different

1350
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,480
things that are going on because most of

1351
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,440
them are going on github i attempted to

1352
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,359
take advantage of

1353
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,599
the new beta

1354
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,599
project boards in um github

1355
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,000
and so

1356
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,799
the

1357
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,839
if you go to the organization

1358
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,480
of um

1359
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,960
the get repo

1360
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,640
uh you should see there's a projects tab

1361
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,160
at the top

1362
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,200
and

1363
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,440
uh then there is at the moment just one

1364
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,359
project you can set up as many of these

1365
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,760
as you like

1366
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,599
um

1367
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,480
when you are working with an issue so

1368
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,079
i'm just going to click on this to open

1369
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,839
it

1370
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:48,240
there is this project's

1371
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,280
uh category here and so you can simply

1372
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,680
say this particular issue we're working

1373
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,920
on i want to show it on the project

1374
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,799
board and you can specify a status and

1375
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,200
as soon as you connect it here

1376
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,760
it will magically appear on the project

1377
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,400
board and we've set it up so that it

1378
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,720
groups by repo

1379
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,280
so we can see

1380
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,599
the open items for

1381
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,760
the deprecation header

1382
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,839
the item potency key media type straight

1383
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:22,960
limits and http problem

1384
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,359
um

1385
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,119
yes

1386
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,480
so

1387
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,880
since we have a repo for document

1388
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,680
the document authors can click on the

1389
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,920
add to the project will automatically

1390
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,240
show from this math program

1391
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,799
i i am still

1392
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,359
getting all of the wrinkles out of the

1393
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:46,799
permissioning

1394
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,440
my understanding is if you are if you

1395
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,640
own

1396
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,000
uh if you are

1397
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
have right permissions on a repo

1398
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,359
you can assign it um

1399
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,440
to the project

1400
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,760
okay so we we might need to tweak some

1401
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,960
things but

1402
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,960
great

1403
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,039
this doesn't require one person to do a

1404
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,720
master list and what you know the

1405
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,000
individual people can do it that's

1406
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,839
awesome correct

1407
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,559
what the the the interesting thing is

1408
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,520
this status here in this column

1409
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,160
is independent of the issue you can we

1410
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,559
can actually add new fields to the

1411
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,079
project so that there is additional

1412
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,640
metadata that can be controlled at the

1413
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,079
project level

1414
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,280
so these statuses are independent of the

1415
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,200
status of the

1416
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,000
uh the individual issue and then so in

1417
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,240
reviewing some of these

1418
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,440
um

1419
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,079
i created these statuses to distinguish

1420
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,160
between the ones were still having

1421
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,319
debates about and the ones that we seem

1422
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,000
to have resolved

1423
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,530
um

1424
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,480
[Music]

1425
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,559
the discussion and it's just a case of

1426
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,200
the uh authors needing to go and do a

1427
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,799
document update um i think one

1428
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,119
mechanism we could use here in processes

1429
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,880
is where we have things that say you

1430
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,640
know there's a document update required

1431
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,240
it would probably be good if we had

1432
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,480
somebody assigned to

1433
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,039
actually do that document update

1434
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,160
and you can see here

1435
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,839
in the case of this one there is

1436
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,920
actually a pr that has been linked to

1437
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,160
this one so it's fairly easy to dig down

1438
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,440
into

1439
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,359
these items and so um

1440
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,359
i

1441
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,760
you once if

1442
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,960
you have been given permission to this

1443
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,680
project there's another view that i set

1444
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,680
up which is more kind of like a kanban

1445
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,559
board

1446
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,359
and you can just drag and drop

1447
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,200
between here but because this is

1448
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,960
changing the status that is owned by the

1449
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,960
project you need right permissions

1450
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,960
on the organizational project

1451
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,960
so this

1452
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,920
we

1453
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,400
will be a thing that hopefully evolves

1454
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,720
uh

1455
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:05,720
to be more effective over time mark

1456
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,640
is it working

1457
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,960
yes we can see okay

1458
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,400
that's it asked for permissions yet

1459
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,359
again

1460
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,280
um that just

1461
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,079
made a question occur to me um

1462
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,000
is the expectation from the chairs that

1463
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,440
document editors

1464
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,599
will respect the categorizations that

1465
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,920
you've given them there so for example i

1466
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,680
went through and did a couple of prs for

1467
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,359
issues in

1468
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:38,079
the 1707 bist today

1469
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,960
that appear to have consensus um should

1470
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,319
we wait for you to change the

1471
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,920
status to document update required

1472
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,240
before you merge them are you are you

1473
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,000
overseeing it to that level or is this

1474
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,240
just entirely kind of best effort

1475
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,599
informational what's the stance there

1476
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,000
um i mean

1477
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,480
that's the conversation to be had like

1478
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,039
the least work we have to do

1479
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,520
the better but um

1480
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,599
i'm i'm more than happy to go and kind

1481
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,880
of reconcile i think if uh

1482
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,960
if we want to use this as a way for

1483
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,119
document editors to communicate with

1484
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,440
chairs that this is the status of where

1485
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,960
we are up to

1486
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,599
then i'm more than happy that that

1487
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,200
document editors have right access on

1488
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,520
this project and can change these things

1489
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,880
themselves

1490
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,520
okay so i just wanted to understand

1491
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,599
whether the status was you know

1492
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,000
exclusively controlled by the chairs or

1493
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,440
shared with the editors or just kind of

1494
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,799
a best efforty sort of thing that sounds

1495
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,400
like it's more the latter than the

1496
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,839
former

1497
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,280
yeah i mean

1498
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,400
as you saw from roberto's deck like he

1499
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,880
had a slide that had a bunch of issues

1500
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,680
that were open and to the base to talk

1501
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,920
about it and then we did that in the

1502
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,839
last ietf meeting and this is just kind

1503
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,760
of like hey here's an easy way of

1504
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,520
keeping that kind of list of here are

1505
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,599
the active things that we're talking

1506
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,400
about uh up to date okay um it was

1507
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,680
unfortunate i don't seem to be able to

1508
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,200
find a way of actually getting the issue

1509
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,440
number to appear as a column but if you

1510
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,119
hover over you see in the bottom

1511
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,839
left-hand corner uh the issue number and

1512
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:15,359
i will note roberto that you called out

1513
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,799
in uh your rate limit headers and issue

1514
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:20,400
number 41

1515
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,079
and i can't find issue number 41 in the

1516
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,440
uh repo

1517
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,000
or at least fish 41 had a very different

1518
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,480
title than the one that you call them so

1519
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,680
we should reconcile there

1520
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,640
yes

1521
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,200
yes agreed eric this is additional

1522
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,119
this is a status view

1523
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,520
with hopefully an absolute minimum

1524
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,720
amount of additional work

1525
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:51,920
and

1526
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,960
we could if we if we decide

1527
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,880
we could just completely

1528
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,280
throw away the status column and just

1529
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,880
use labels

1530
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,000
and we could use labels as a way for

1531
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,240
document authors to just put a label on

1532
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,280
an issue in and be able to surface that

1533
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,400
up at

1534
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,200
the central place

1535
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,560
and because you can see over here

1536
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,000
whether an issue has actually been

1537
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,198
closed or is still open

1538
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,759
how easy is it to share labels uh no you

1539
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:30,640
have to

1540
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,679
reinvent the labels

1541
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:44,399
you're a little quiet rich yeah sorry

1542
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,640
about that so the script i used to

1543
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,640
create the repos when we have a new

1544
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,359
document just copies

1545
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,640
standard set of labels that came from

1546
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,759
you know marx and martin's first thing

1547
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,920
uh using the quick group

1548
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,679
so

1549
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,439
yeah there's no way to say these are

1550
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,960
labels for

1551
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,040
across a whole

1552
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,640
organization

1553
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,679
but

1554
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,279
it's automated it's not terribly

1555
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,600
difficult

1556
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,600
okay

1557
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,198
so that was the main thing

1558
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,000
go ahead

1559
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,799
as i say mark points out it's possible

1560
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:23,040
to create default set of labels for new

1561
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,679
new repositories which would be

1562
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,158
presumably very partly very useful for

1563
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:30,158
this group is our goal is to get you

1564
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:32,880
know many documents through so i'll take

1565
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,839
a look at that

1566
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,238
cool

1567
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,080
just in an attempt to use this for a

1568
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,880
moment um

1569
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,040
there uh there is still active work

1570
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,839
going on in deprecation header uh

1571
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,679
there's some items here

1572
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,040
there

1573
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,840
is a couple of items still in discussion

1574
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,320
so please i encourage you to

1575
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,159
go check out these issues on the github

1576
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,120
repo

1577
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,199
uh and provide feedback

1578
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,520
um

1579
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,760
i debated whether or not to create this

1580
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,239
block this is this is related to using

1581
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,640
date time and there was a reference to

1582
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,520
other ongoing work with regards to what

1583
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,800
is

1584
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,480
the appropriate

1585
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,800
use of

1586
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,320
a date time versus just a delta seconds

1587
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,360
um

1588
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,320
as i say we can evolve these statuses uh

1589
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,239
the item potency header is has expired

1590
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,760
uh we should uh follow up with sanjay

1591
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,480
uh as to

1592
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,080
whether this is going to come back to

1593
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,280
life

1594
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,880
or we should encourage sanjay to bring

1595
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,600
this back to life

1596
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,880
and

1597
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,719
uh

1598
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,719
we've discussed those two and 7807 again

1599
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,239
some open items for discussion

1600
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,920
and with that

1601
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,800
oh i see somebody in the queue

1602
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,120
eric

1603
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,440
yep um

1604
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,760
hello thanks there this is eric yeah

1605
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,239
just with regard to the item policy i

1606
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,719
think that that was not kind of um

1607
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,640
intentional so to speak that it expired

1608
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,560
the idea was not to say we're not doing

1609
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,520
that anymore it's just that um there are

1610
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,440
a couple of open issues that should be

1611
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,199
addressed i don't think i don't think we

1612
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,560
have a good plan

1613
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,600
on

1614
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,040
which of these issues should be

1615
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,000
addressed before we create a new version

1616
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,960
but

1617
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,880
at least the intention definitely is to

1618
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,280
keep this alive um even though it is

1619
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,760
only expired so i think i think we

1620
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,600
should definitely keep it in there and

1621
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,080
hopefully um this one will have a new

1622
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,800
version in the not too distant future

1623
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,840
thank

1624
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,199
it would be good to get confirmation

1625
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,800
because i i read through some of these

1626
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,040
issues and it looked very much like

1627
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,960
there was a suggestion and the response

1628
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,800
was yes yes we should update that in the

1629
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,760
document um so those

1630
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,719
yeah like some of the things

1631
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,159
that you put there you know it's like

1632
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,080
okay somebody should be assigned to it

1633
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,719
so that we know who to go back to and

1634
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,199
yeah good but i think like your table

1635
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,640
there really is also it's just great for

1636
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,080
housekeeping right like making sure that

1637
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,120
well

1638
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,320
we're discussing many things but

1639
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,920
nobody's responsible maybe that's not a

1640
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,320
good sign

1641
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,159
mark

1642
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,000
yeah okay i should really unmute in

1643
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,360
anticipation

1644
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,560
i guess

1645
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,840
um

1646
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,840
do do i may have misunderstood the

1647
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,360
agenda do we have time to actually

1648
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,679
briefly run through the 7807 issues

1649
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:50,719
because i think that would actually help

1650
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:53,040
us move the document forward

1651
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,600
i believe we can the primary uh

1652
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,719
item left on the agenda is martin's

1653
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,000
date request

1654
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,120
but i we have 50 i don't think it's

1655
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,480
going to take very long

1656
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,040
okay so let's

1657
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,280
okay um so

1658
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,719
i'll use the numbers on the left even

1659
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:13,679
though we know that they're not the real

1660
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,920
numbers um the number 21 mapping problem

1661
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,400
details into a header um

1662
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,840
i suggested that just as kind of a

1663
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,440
thought experiment because it has come

1664
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,320
up in the past uh before

1665
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,480
uh of of conveying this information in a

1666
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,080
header when you don't have access to

1667
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,360
writing to the response body for

1668
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,719
whatever reason

1669
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,719
um and or or if you want to expose this

1670
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:34,080
information to an immediate area that

1671
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,239
doesn't want to crack the body open um i

1672
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,000
should say content i shouldn't say body

1673
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,199
but you know old school um

1674
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:42,880
and it seems to me like the response to

1675
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,440
this was was somewhat lukewarm

1676
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,840
so um on the one hand you know a

1677
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,159
lukewarm response like this

1678
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,679
i think if i could characterize the

1679
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,199
responses i've seen is that oh yeah that

1680
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:54,320
might be useful but i don't really have

1681
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,640
an immediate use for it now

1682
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,159
so uh the most obvious thing to do would

1683
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,960
be to drop it and just move on um

1684
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,560
i think i if you look at the very last

1685
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,719
comment i said if if people think that

1686
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,320
they have a clear use for this or or

1687
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,679
that it might be useful very soon we

1688
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,040
should do it while we have the document

1689
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,800
open because it's just easy to do that

1690
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,199
otherwise we can wait on it knowing that

1691
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,199
you know if there is pressure to use it

1692
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,560
out there then that'll build up for a

1693
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,679
while until we actually publish the

1694
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,040
document which we've experienced for a

1695
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,920
lot of other api facilities as well

1696
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,520
so i don't have strong feelings about

1697
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,400
this i'm happy to drive uh to drop it if

1698
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,800
no one wants to fight for it um i just

1699
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,000
was curious to see what other people

1700
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,480
thought about it

1701
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,159
i guess last call for including this

1702
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,080
into this pack

1703
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,239
i i i thought it was a a really

1704
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:45,760
interesting possibility to address the

1705
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,440
topic that has come up multiple times

1706
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,280
before which is this ability to include

1707
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,719
warnings

1708
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,040
um

1709
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,640
it depends on how fatal you perceive the

1710
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,360
word

1711
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,440
problem

1712
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,880
um

1713
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,120
because we have smart problems

1714
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,080
you know that's right that's a small

1715
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,360
problem you might consider rewarding

1716
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,840
uh so i i think that's

1717
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,239
that would be a

1718
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:17,920
a really nice thing to be able to just

1719
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,040
say yes i want to add a header

1720
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:21,840
uh

1721
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,520
to indicate there is some kind of

1722
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,199
problem with this response even though i

1723
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:29,199
returned it to you with the 200 okay

1724
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,920
i i mean i'm happy to do a pr just to

1725
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,440
see what it looks like i mean my

1726
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,960
inclination would be if it's a huge wall

1727
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,800
of text it's not worth it

1728
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,239
um but if we can get a couple of

1729
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:39,600
paragraphs and get some value out of it

1730
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,640
i'm happy to put it out there and then

1731
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,560
see if that spurs anyone to say yes i'd

1732
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,560
really like to have that

1733
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,560
does that make sense

1734
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,800
just to me i'm also equally happy to

1735
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,679
close it with no action

1736
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,159
i think it can have some value

1737
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,440
so i'm not sure about the queue but i

1738
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,320
think i

1739
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,320
it's my turn right

1740
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,760
so yeah

1741
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,000
this isn't circuit again um yeah i would

1742
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,199
actually second i think it might be

1743
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,040
useful for one kind of style so i would

1744
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,400
i would argue for keeping it in

1745
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,760
okay that that's that's actually really

1746
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,159
helpful i'll i'm happy to do a pr and

1747
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,320
just see what it looks like and it may

1748
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,960
very well be that that that reveals that

1749
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,040
it's a horrible idea or horribly complex

1750
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,960
and not worth the effort or whatever but

1751
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,840
i'm willing to try so i'll give it a go

1752
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,320
um next issue thank you hans that was

1753
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,440
helpful and and roberto

1754
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,640
um down thank you

1755
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,800
requiring a specification document i

1756
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,080
think that is just a mechanical thing

1757
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,159
about the registration policy i copied

1758
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,840
for the registry of problem types and i

1759
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,120
copied some text from elsewhere that

1760
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,239
wasn't appropriate and this is a

1761
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,440
correction of that

1762
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,199
so there's a pr there if anybody wants

1763
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,480
to look at it i intend to merge that

1764
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,800
very soon

1765
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,239
excuse me

1766
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:09,280
uh the next one number quote unquote 23

1767
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,920
multiple problems um this has been a

1768
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,920
long discussion and i i think we have a

1769
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:14,840
fairly

1770
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,280
strong agreement at least in the issue

1771
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,320
and in the discussions we've had

1772
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,800
previously in working group sessions

1773
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,560
on a path forward in terms of deleting

1774
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,600
some text about status code 207 that is

1775
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,080
not terribly good practice and uh

1776
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,440
putting in another kind of warning about

1777
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,080
the limitations of of this structure

1778
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,719
uh sanjay was uh i know a bit sad about

1779
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,800
removing the examples that he'd put the

1780
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,080
work into or at least one of the

1781
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,280
examples that he put the work into

1782
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,719
adding to the spec

1783
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,719
but i think that there's a fairly strong

1784
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,080
agreement there so if folks want to look

1785
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,440
at that pr

1786
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,320
um

1787
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,480
and give any feedback i again intend to

1788
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,239
merge that pretty soon as well

1789
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,880
and if folks have comments about that

1790
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,239
right now i'm happy to chat about it

1791
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,159
i i hadn't posed a question

1792
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:05,280
as to

1793
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,560
you know this

1794
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,400
question about putting

1795
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,640
uh examples into the spec but actually

1796
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,760
not putting is a best practices document

1797
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,080
like the natural next logical conclusion

1798
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,320
there

1799
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,440
or is that overkill

1800
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,800
a best practice document for 7807

1801
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,600
yeah to include all of these examples of

1802
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,280
well this is how you do multiple problem

1803
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,440
types and this is how you use it for

1804
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,159
warnings and this is how you

1805
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:35,520
i i would hope that that kind of

1806
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,760
documentation in the first instance

1807
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,400
you'd you'd put it into some of the um

1808
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,560
you know whether a blog or some sort of

1809
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,239
industry communication or something or

1810
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:45,760
something i think there are a number of

1811
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,199
outlets out there like that and if there

1812
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:48,800
aren't there should be you know you kind

1813
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,640
of smashing mag but for api developers

1814
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,239
or whatever you know

1815
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:53,679
if anybody goes and does that i expect

1816
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:55,440
to cut just saying

1817
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,040
um

1818
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,760
yeah and and you know if we can uh

1819
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,120
there's a line to be walked there but i

1820
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,800
think

1821
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,640
that would be my response for now yeah

1822
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,400
um

1823
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,520
hans do you have your hand up for this

1824
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,560
or or is that just uh

1825
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,520
no okay

1826
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,040
um

1827
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,040
extension to so so

1828
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,120
the show source of problem and request

1829
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,360
forex class of errors

1830
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,080
that is actually um blocked by another

1831
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,920
issue which isn't on this listing for

1832
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,080
some reason

1833
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,120
um

1834
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,480
let's

1835
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,360
see if we can fix that

1836
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,440
currently when i show share my screen

1837
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,280
things go a lot slower

1838
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,600
uh is it is the issue that's blocking it

1839
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,000
discussed here i mentioned

1840
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,400
uh at the bottom it should be yes 36

1841
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,080
that one right there which was just

1842
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,519
opened recently maybe that's why

1843
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,199
there we go

1844
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,120
so we we've had this latent problem in a

1845
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,840
lot of discussions about 7807

1846
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,440
and it's good i'm actually glad that

1847
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,800
this was opened as a separate issue so

1848
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,040
we can just discuss it separately

1849
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,560
um and and it's that um the 7807 does

1850
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,719
not allow new standard

1851
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:13,679
um

1852
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:14,719
uh

1853
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,320
d done what's what i'm looking for

1854
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,440
properties

1855
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,280
members whatever to be added to the

1856
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,120
structure

1857
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,199
that all the all the ones that aren't in

1858
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:24,639
7807

1859
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,320
are effectively any possible name is

1860
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,679
under control of the problem type so

1861
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,920
you know we can't come up and say well

1862
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,360
here's a new

1863
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,199
uh member for

1864
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,960
i don't know uh for a pointer to where

1865
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,480
the problem is in the response body for

1866
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,760
example which is

1867
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,000
what the previous issue was about

1868
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,760
um and so if you scroll all the way down

1869
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,199
um

1870
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,199
yeah i think that that we have a couple

1871
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:52,639
of ways out of this

1872
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,120
um we we can either you know zero which

1873
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,960
i didn't put into this message is the

1874
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,199
status quo which is don't

1875
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:01,600
allow don't say anything about this

1876
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,760
uh or we could find a name convention

1877
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,840
for new standard properties that doesn't

1878
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,159
conflict with any existing usage so for

1879
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,080
example add a prefix to new standard

1880
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,639
properties um and and the issue with

1881
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,199
that is that we by nature can't know all

1882
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:18,159
of the usage of of 7807 around the world

1883
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,600
and that we won't conflict with them in

1884
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,920
every single instance you know

1885
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,679
we can make that less likely

1886
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:25,199
by choosing a weird prefix and then of

1887
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:26,960
course we have weird ugly prefixes on

1888
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,679
new standard properties but whatever

1889
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:32,080
um but but that's kind of like a just a

1890
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,600
you know there's a risk strategy we had

1891
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,600
around if we take that path

1892
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,199
uh the other path we have is to mint a

1893
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,960
new media type for problem details for

1894
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,400
this next revision

1895
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,840
uh and the concern there you know that

1896
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,440
gives us a clean slate to work with but

1897
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,280
of course that also

1898
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,560
risks creating fragmentation that now

1899
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,239
api developers have to choose which one

1900
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,159
they use and there's momentum behind the

1901
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,520
old one and oh would i have to use this

1902
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,560
new thing but i don't know if everybody

1903
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,480
supports it blah blah blah blah

1904
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,239
and so that that creates more confusion

1905
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,159
potentially

1906
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:02,719
there is a third option and that's kind

1907
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:07,360
of the unspoken option in 1707 which is

1908
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,920
we can't define new standard this is

1909
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,760
recognized in every problem instance

1910
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,199
across the world

1911
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,120
but what we can do is create new

1912
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,199
conventions that new problem types or

1913
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,120
any problem types can opt into and say

1914
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,199
oh yes i use that convention so for

1915
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:23,120
example we could create a convention

1916
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,880
that there's a problem pointer and it

1917
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,719
means something when the type says it

1918
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,159
means something

1919
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:29,040
um

1920
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,520
not quite as automatic and nice as you'd

1921
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,679
like but you know maybe a path forward

1922
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,199
without breaking too much

1923
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,360
i i don't have any strong feelings here

1924
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,880
personally if you want to call that

1925
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,679
option zero one two and three

1926
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:44,159
but um i kind of feel like

1927
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,880
i i i'm most against option two i think

1928
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,400
minting a new media type there should be

1929
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,560
a fairly high bar against it

1930
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,639
and i think option one actually

1931
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,480
probably could work my only concern

1932
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,760
there is

1933
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,760
um there's a lot of experiments that

1934
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,080
people want to have i think about oh

1935
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,440
that that's a good idea this is a good

1936
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,360
idea and we should have a chat about

1937
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,600
what the bar is for new problem for new

1938
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,960
standard attributes i don't think we

1939
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:07,920
should just put them out there

1940
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,360
willy-nilly

1941
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,199
um but but that's all i have to say

1942
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,880
about this i'm really curious to hear

1943
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,840
what other folks have to say about it

1944
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,840
eric

1945
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,159
um

1946
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,320
yes thanks this is eric

1947
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,560
um thanks mark for coming up with these

1948
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,000
suggestions

1949
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
um for number one i think you know we

1950
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,080
have a typical problem like this good

1951
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,880
old x-dash considered harmful right it's

1952
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,600
like once people start using stuff then

1953
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,679
it's kind of that's how it is and and

1954
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,360
renaming it to whatever convention we

1955
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,440
come up with is always a little bit hard

1956
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,719
but um

1957
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,880
i think my my preference probably would

1958
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,880
be number one only that we

1959
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,560
maybe we could consider using uris which

1960
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,040
why not it's kind of like a prefix but

1961
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,159
one that

1962
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,960
maybe is a little less just random but

1963
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,400
anyway um

1964
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:04,320
the the second one also to me is not so

1965
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,520
attractive

1966
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,080
the third one actually i have

1967
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,080
my problem with that is that this means

1968
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,159
that that kind of each type would need

1969
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:15,120
to kind of opt in individually and i

1970
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,400
think in many cases

1971
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,719
you might rather have a situation where

1972
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,560
you say my api

1973
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,560
always uses these fields and then it

1974
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,480
would become kind of complicated to say

1975
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:27,120
well and i have these 28 types and then

1976
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,960
all these 28 types so to speak would

1977
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,800
need to opt in into that additional

1978
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,560
field that you're trying to use so so i

1979
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,040
think that one is like

1980
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,000
it doesn't scale so well i think so my i

1981
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,159
think my preference would be to go with

1982
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:43,120
number one and to go with um

1983
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,360
uri some kind of uri

1984
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,400
as a prefix and then i think the risk of

1985
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,600
conflicts is relatively low

1986
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,719
and that's

1987
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:56,400
well given what rfc 7807 already does i

1988
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,159
think that's maybe the best thing that

1989
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,130
we can think of

1990
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,760
[Music]

1991
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,000
i i i think i agree with on most things

1992
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,600
there i think the for me the problem

1993
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,159
with the third option is that tools

1994
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:09,120
um

1995
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,120
want to be able to automatically you

1996
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,280
know invoke the semantics without

1997
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,360
recognizing a particular problem type

1998
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,360
and then you can offer richer you know

1999
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,120
handling of a problem without having to

2000
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,679
know its particular semantics um and and

2001
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,840
if it's opt-in like that then we that

2002
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,000
implies that we'd need some sort of

2003
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,800
problem type description format to

2004
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,960
enable tools to to process that which is

2005
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,639
kind of nasty and frankly we know it's

2006
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:34,080
not going to happen what they'll do is

2007
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,920
just say oh look it's using problem

2008
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,840
pointer i reckon it probably means that

2009
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,520
even though i don't know for sure

2010
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,520
um so yeah i think you're right i think

2011
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,800
that number one is probably the right

2012
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,520
way to go i i do have kind of this

2013
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,600
visceral reaction to using

2014
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,800
uh uh

2015
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,440
uris as json property names i think that

2016
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,960
some developers are absolutely fine with

2017
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,800
that especially if they are of the link

2018
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,400
data world and other developers are

2019
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,360
going to look at that and say well i'm

2020
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,040
not going to use that then

2021
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,280
um and i'd like to avoid that reaction

2022
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,080
personally i'd rather find i don't know

2023
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,320
some people use a dollar sign i don't

2024
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,400
know double colon we can have that bike

2025
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,679
shooting exercise later on

2026
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,159
this is daryl just one comment on the

2027
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,760
third option

2028
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,840
um as

2029
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:25,199
the 7807 biz introduces a json schema

2030
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:27,840
i think what the third option is

2031
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,199
describing is what json schema now

2032
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:34,880
allows with vocabularies and dialects

2033
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,360
and because this is almost exactly what

2034
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,679
we did in open api

2035
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:42,960
uh in order to extend the keywords that

2036
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,400
are supported

2037
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,960
uh we introduced a vocabulary and then

2038
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,840
you declare

2039
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,120
that um

2040
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:54,320
we are using this dialect which is a set

2041
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,719
of vocabularies so there may be some

2042
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,080
mechanics

2043
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,360
it it's a little

2044
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,080
interesting to get your head around but

2045
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,600
there may be some mechanics that we

2046
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,840
could reuse but it is somewhat dependent

2047
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,159
on how well adoption of dialects and

2048
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:11,440
vocabs

2049
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,360
comes because it's fairly new in json

2050
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,759
schema

2051
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,400
so if if i can

2052
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,960
respond oh is it working now fantastic

2053
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,719
it's telling me that it's success big

2054
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:24,560
green box that's great

2055
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,199
um i i have again a kind of a visceral

2056
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:28,800
reaction that it's very similar to link

2057
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,159
data world where

2058
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,880
they're like you know the to me the the

2059
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,960
whole idea there is well we've got this

2060
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,400
data model that we overlay on top of

2061
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,360
json

2062
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,159
but

2063
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:40,800
it looks like normal json and that's

2064
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,719
kind of an attractive nuisance you know

2065
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,880
because a developer who doesn't use

2066
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,000
linked data will come along and say oh

2067
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,360
look it's json but if they don't use

2068
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,960
that data model they might actually

2069
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,880
really mess things up

2070
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,560
and and so when you overlay these data

2071
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,480
models on top of really attractive

2072
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,400
native data models

2073
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,960
um and processing models and so forth it

2074
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,280
it becomes tricky for for everyday

2075
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,040
developers to use it and so i'm a little

2076
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,560
wary of those sorts of things i think it

2077
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:09,400
should behave like it looks you know

2078
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,840
okay

2079
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,920
plenty of meaty issues

2080
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,239
do you have anything it sounds

2081
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,560
good oh sorry so it sounds like there's

2082
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,239
there's maybe some convergence on the

2083
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:29,920
number one with a tremendous bike

2084
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,159
to build

2085
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,560
if if i can characterize that one

2086
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:39,120
yeah okay um so that one you're not 2x

2087
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,040
oh don't don't start me on that

2088
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,480
um

2089
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,880
so that that that actually the number 24

2090
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,639
is dependent upon that number 26. if we

2091
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,440
get the number 26 sorted out then

2092
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,639
there's just a question of whether or

2093
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:52,480
not we actually do that and we'll get

2094
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:57,040
there then ld jason ld context

2095
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,480
personally i

2096
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,840
won't use it but i know that other

2097
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,199
people want to

2098
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:02,800
i don't know that it's harmful to add to

2099
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,800
the specs so i've just asked for people

2100
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,239
to make a proposal

2101
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:08,080
and we're waiting for that for someone

2102
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,840
to make a pr of what text actually needs

2103
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,600
to appear in this in the spec so if

2104
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,719
somebody wants to go off and do that

2105
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:15,440
work that's great um if it if nobody

2106
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,719
does it by the time that uh uh

2107
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:20,159
we get a last call i think we'll

2108
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,440
probably just drop this issue but i'm

2109
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,719
hoping ashborne or somebody will step up

2110
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,080
and i think that's everything for this

2111
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,280
so thank you thanks for the time

2112
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,080
excellent thank you

2113
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,440
okay so if i

2114
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,520
remember the agenda well enough i

2115
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,120
believe

2116
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,239
next up is

2117
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,960
martin you're gonna have to do the thing

2118
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,040
with the thing with the

2119
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,519
slides

2120
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,080
yeah sorry

2121
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:05,040
to fix my uh

2122
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,520
i don't know you don't have to do it

2123
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,880
you're fine to do that

2124
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,520
i was uh requesting it

2125
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,520
that's cool

2126
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,960
now i'm gonna have to say things like

2127
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,280
next slide please

2128
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,159
oh

2129
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:19,199
you know what

2130
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:22,480
yeah sure say next slide

2131
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,440
i i did say that i think the title

2132
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,759
starts

2133
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,719
all right so um

2134
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,320
uh this is this is something that's come

2135
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:40,000
up in the ohio working group as well no

2136
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,400
it seems that we're uh running into a

2137
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,719
bunch of issues uh with the use of http

2138
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:47,440
that are kind of interesting and

2139
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,480
sort of break into new ground

2140
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,040
one of the things there that

2141
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,920
we've discovered is that there's

2142
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,280
some use for having the ability to to

2143
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,800
mark the time of a request

2144
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,040
particularly in that case for dealing

2145
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,639
with

2146
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:09,360
anti-replay as i'll get into later but

2147
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,120
there's a general class of things where

2148
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,840
you put the current time into a request

2149
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,920
or something like that so that you limit

2150
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,040
the the time over which something oh

2151
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,760
oh that's a nice feature

2152
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,280
someone spent a lot of time on that i

2153
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,840
can move the slides down

2154
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,600
um

2155
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,840
so the purpose of this craft is to

2156
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,920
basically explore the use of putting the

2157
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,080
current time in a request

2158
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,320
and all of the hazards that that

2159
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,560
necessarily come with that moral and

2160
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,679
otherwise

2161
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,239
uh with the publicly trying to make date

2162
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:45,839
time stamps and requests

2163
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,880
so the specific that we have in ohio is

2164
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,920
that

2165
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,320
requests are replayable in that context

2166
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,679
which is not particularly good

2167
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:58,800
and so

2168
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,040
having a replay strategy is particularly

2169
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,159
useful

2170
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:03,280
um

2171
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,040
and in order to

2172
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,960
manage the state commitments on servers

2173
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,000
that are doing anti-replay

2174
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,040
you

2175
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,239
probably want to have something like a

2176
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:14,320
date or sequence number or some sort of

2177
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,040
monotonically increasing thing a date is

2178
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,679
kind of okay

2179
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,760
having a date means that if you receive

2180
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,400
a request that's been replayed you can

2181
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,639
rapidly identify it as such and then

2182
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,520
just out of hand reject it

2183
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,040
and then for those requests that are

2184
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,719
within a certain window of the current

2185
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:35,760
time you can simply say well i'll accept

2186
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,080
those and remember some other details of

2187
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,560
the request so that if another one with

2188
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:41,600
the same

2189
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,920
details comes in again you can quickly

2190
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,440
reject it

2191
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,239
as a duplicate

2192
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:49,840
without the date

2193
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,520
there's basically an infinite state

2194
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,760
problem that the server has to deal with

2195
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:58,480
so primarily looking at date but uh

2196
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,239
there are other other timestamps in

2197
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,840
requests

2198
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,520
so um probably the biggest part of the

2199
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,600
document talks about the ad clock

2200
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,560
problem

2201
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,360
so

2202
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,760
shockingly common that our clients and

2203
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,840
servers have a disagreement about what

2204
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,920
time it is it's quite often the case

2205
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,360
that uh

2206
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,440
the clients are very very badly wrong

2207
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,880
we've seen

2208
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,760
times that are in the wrong millennium

2209
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,800
and

2210
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,840
um

2211
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,080
it's not that unusual to see things that

2212
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:31,199
are months or years out of out of date

2213
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,280
so um

2214
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,120
having you having a means to break that

2215
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,280
is interesting there's a scheme that's

2216
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,920
suggested in the document that uh

2217
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,320
simply says take the date from the

2218
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,840
response

2219
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,840
and try again

2220
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,719
of course um using an untrusted time

2221
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:51,040
from an arbitrary server random servers

2222
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,400
on the internet is probably unwise uh

2223
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,239
talk about that a little bit as well

2224
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:58,239
uh talk about the caching

2225
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:00,719
interaction and uh some of the things

2226
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:01,679
that might happen if you have an

2227
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,520
intermediary in the path

2228
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,040
it's quite common

2229
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,520
for things like cdns to overwrite the

2230
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,400
date

2231
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,159
on the expectation that the cbn knows

2232
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:12,800
what time it is they often take extra

2233
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,080
clearing

2234
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,480
ensuring that they have good clocks

2235
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:19,040
the servers that back them don't often

2236
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,040
get the get the time right so city ends

2237
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,440
often fix it up for you

2238
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,320
the implication there is

2239
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,639
generally that this is no problem

2240
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:31,199
uh but if the server time is very very

2241
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:34,159
badly wrong and it's rejecting requests

2242
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,639
and the cdn is fixing the date up on the

2243
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:37,760
way out

2244
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,280
it could mean that you never get a

2245
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,320
request through ever

2246
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,320
so um i know we had some discussion with

2247
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,239
this one already um

2248
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:49,760
the

2249
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,080
questions i have is do people find this

2250
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:55,520
material useful um and is this something

2251
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,800
that the group would be interested in

2252
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,119
working on

2253
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:08,159
he says expectantly

2254
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,400
oh mark tells me i'm wrong about why

2255
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,800
this idiom is right we write today

2256
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,040
i bet they rewrite it for all sorts of

2257
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:20,159
scary caching reasons

2258
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,119
uh jonathan asked the chat

2259
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,159
is there

2260
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,639
an error description for i need a date

2261
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:32,719
but it didn't include one

2262
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,960
yes so part of what this document has is

2263
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,800
a problem report type that says your

2264
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,159
date was wrong

2265
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:42,519
which includes your date was absent

2266
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,040
uh

2267
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:58,800
so

2268
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,000
uh

2269
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,760
how straightforward and short is this

2270
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,480
document do you think martin

2271
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,520
it's about five pages from memory

2272
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,440
uh

2273
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,679
i don't do da i don't do pages anymore

2274
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:15,119
so i couldn't i couldn't tell you maybe

2275
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:16,239
it's eight

2276
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:17,440
um

2277
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:21,799
it's not a particularly long one

2278
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,760
yeah i don't i don't do pages anymore

2279
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,480
it's probably five

2280
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,600
i you know screen screenfuls would have

2281
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:34,080
been enough that's fine

2282
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,320
yeah

2283
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,040
oh mark's in the queue

2284
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,199
yeah

2285
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:48,000
dang i'm just talking to okay good good

2286
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,280
um

2287
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,600
so i think maybe uh the the focus of the

2288
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,920
discussion here should be on you know if

2289
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,360
this document just needs a home i'm sure

2290
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,600
that ohio could do it i'm sure that http

2291
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,600
would probably be happy to do it as well

2292
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,760
i think maybe the focus the way to make

2293
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,000
this discussion useful is is do api

2294
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,800
folks think that having this document

2295
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,320
and these clarifications in this problem

2296
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,880
type would be useful for api consumers

2297
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,159
and api designers um and and if so then

2298
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,000
this is a natural home for it and if

2299
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,440
it's a little more scratching your head

2300
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,440
i'm not so sure we can probably just do

2301
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,760
an http or in ohio or wherever and if it

2302
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,119
gets used elsewhere that's great but

2303
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:25,520
it's not you know necessary to have it

2304
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,560
here

2305
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,320
that's how i'd think about it personally

2306
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,600
i don't know the answer that's just how

2307
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,600
i would find the question

2308
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,520
yeah um i think when i when i first

2309
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,600
floated this one i don't know if it was

2310
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,880
you mark who pointed out the item

2311
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,119
potency key work and there's a bit of a

2312
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,040
relationship with that one

2313
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,520
um the sort of complementary pieces of

2314
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,760
work

2315
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:48,960
right i remember that now that's right

2316
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,199
yeah

2317
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,840
just go ahead robert just speak up

2318
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,480
yeah

2319
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,280
yeah

2320
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,840
well uh

2321
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:08,639
thanks martin i i think

2322
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,880
it's okay the documents to be related to

2323
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:13,679
timestamps in general

2324
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:14,639
but

2325
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,360
i i really don't want to mess with dave

2326
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,320
because

2327
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,800
uh and i i'm not even sure that this is

2328
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,600
the right place where

2329
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,600
in information

2330
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,320
that should be

2331
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,560
in in some way

2332
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:33,840
guaranteed should be used but this is

2333
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,159
a personal opinion this this is my

2334
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:37,280
opinion for

2335
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:41,199
uh seeing the networks and for uh

2336
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:42,880
and in general for

2337
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,600
whatever is related to

2338
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,800
either confidential integrity or

2339
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,480
that is not just

2340
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:53,040
an operative information

2341
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,040
that's it

2342
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,159
so um

2343
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,600
i think that's that's that's a fair

2344
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,360
comment i i didn't quite catch your

2345
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:02,080
piece about um

2346
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,719
third date

2347
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,800
i i would just say the the document

2348
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,440
should be named time stamp information

2349
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:14,000
instead of date because we are speaking

2350
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,600
in general about timestamp right

2351
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,000
yeah and it's possibly not even http

2352
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,320
specific apart from the problem type

2353
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,960
work right

2354
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,639
yeah i'll make that change

2355
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:33,920
i think this is daryl's speaking from an

2356
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:37,280
api perspective i haven't seen this

2357
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:40,880
particular issue come up a whole lot um

2358
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,040
although i can imagine

2359
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,760
uh four apis that require to do signed

2360
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,920
requests this does get a lot more

2361
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,040
interesting

2362
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,239
um

2363
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:53,119
and i think just the fact that we're

2364
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:57,040
using and it does include a problem type

2365
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,280
as a way of describing it does

2366
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,480
kind of correlate it back to apis fairly

2367
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:03,840
strongly so

2368
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,400
um i i think

2369
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,600
this it does seem like a reasonable home

2370
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,159
for adding this capability even though

2371
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,239
maybe at the moment in the api world

2372
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:17,040
it's fairly niche

2373
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:23,280
all right

2374
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:27,760
is it working okay

2375
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,080
um that makes me wonder whether uh have

2376
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,760
you talked to justin about this because

2377
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,119
if it's

2378
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:34,080
you know

2379
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,440
has the strong link to the signatures

2380
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,920
draft maybe uh um it could go in there

2381
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,760
or be a companion document or just just

2382
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,639
stop thinking out loud

2383
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,719
yeah i i haven't spoken to justin about

2384
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,960
this one uh in the discussion i have

2385
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,040
with roberto on the list i think we we

2386
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,040
kind of concluded that the signatures

2387
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,840
thing was was less directly applicable

2388
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,520
to this one it's it's often the case

2389
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:58,080
that when something signs something they

2390
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,400
put the time at which they signed it

2391
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,480
but the purpose of that is is usage

2392
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:05,600
limitation rather than to indicate the

2393
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,119
the current time

2394
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:09,199
and so the the connection to signatures

2395
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:10,719
is a little weaker than

2396
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:12,159
than that so

2397
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:13,520
i don't think i don't want to over

2398
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,360
emphasize the the application to

2399
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,360
signatures

2400
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,719
okay well i've gotten some good feedback

2401
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:35,600
here perhaps um i've got to take this to

2402
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,800
the list and

2403
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,760
i've got a revision to make there's um

2404
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,440
there's a few things that have come up

2405
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,679
already in the discussions thus far

2406
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:45,840
i might revise it and then ask again on

2407
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,320
the list and we can have that discussion

2408
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,520
that's the chairs object

2409
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,199
just from the perspective of this

2410
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:55,040
working group i have a small worry that

2411
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,440
it might

2412
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,040
interfere with or or have a

2413
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,880
distracting kind of element with the

2414
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,199
item potentially key work um i'm i'm not

2415
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:08,480
sure it would be a you know

2416
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:10,719
i i guess i'm wondering out loud whether

2417
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:11,840
they would

2418
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,520
resonate with with each other or whether

2419
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,280
they would pull pull apart from each

2420
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:18,000
other i'm not sure

2421
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,840
my read of the item potency stuff is

2422
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,400
that this is complementary and entirely

2423
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,560
complementary you can use both or

2424
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:25,840
neither or one

2425
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,760
and and that's going to work out pretty

2426
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,800
well

2427
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,080
depending on what it is that you're

2428
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:31,920
looking to do

2429
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,760
so i think this is probably okay for

2430
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,520
that and one of the nice things about

2431
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,000
the item potency work is that it could

2432
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,159
be a way to to signal

2433
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:44,080
what what aspects of the request can uh

2434
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,880
determine that it is either put or not

2435
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:47,920
uh which

2436
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,760
is sort of very complimentary if you

2437
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,280
you're talking about anti-replay

2438
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:53,119
strategies and whatnot

2439
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:55,040
because if you if you've got an item

2440
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,400
patent request then

2441
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,000
you don't have to worry as much about

2442
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,400
the item uh the the replay properties or

2443
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,400
something

2444
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,159
i thought i thought they were very much

2445
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:07,159
complimentary

2446
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:16,560
all right so you'll make some changes

2447
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,159
and bring it to the list and maybe we'll

2448
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:20,400
discuss adoption or

2449
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,040
you can continue to venue shop

2450
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,800
i would

2451
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,639
i would never say that

2452
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,239
i'm not no

2453
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:30,639
finding the most appropriate with useful

2454
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:32,960
work i'm sorry i said it two times oh

2455
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:36,159
very good very good

2456
01:43:36,159 --> 01:43:39,159
yeah

2457
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,280
all right uh

2458
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,880
are we in the aob section now daryl um

2459
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:49,679
we we are in the um

2460
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:52,400
proposal for new working group documents

2461
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,960
which we are now more enthusiastically

2462
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,239
open to

2463
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:58,960
um i believe

2464
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,119
uh we had

2465
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:03,520
last time a conversation about link

2466
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,639
template

2467
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:08,159
uh as uh a

2468
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,800
document to do a call for adoption

2469
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,080
unlist

2470
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,560
which i believe we failed to do

2471
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,360
uh and so we are recommitted this time

2472
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,000
we really will do call for adoption and

2473
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,400
we have more renewed enthusiasm about

2474
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,440
adopting more docs

2475
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,119
so

2476
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,679
look out for that on the mailing list

2477
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:32,060
and the other

2478
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:33,360
[Music]

2479
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:36,480
document that has been brought up in the

2480
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,960
discussions area

2481
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:42,719
uh on the github repo is the

2482
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,639
health check

2483
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:45,600
um

2484
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,880
document which is um

2485
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,679
as i understand it is currently an

2486
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:54,159
individual contribution

2487
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:55,040
but it

2488
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,480
doesn't have a working group home

2489
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:02,000
and i'm gonna defer to rich with regards

2490
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
to what the processes and procedures of

2491
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,360
adopting something like that would be

2492
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,520
um

2493
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:11,679
we can adopt it you know

2494
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,199
the author would

2495
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,199
presumably want to want to have that

2496
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:16,880
adopted

2497
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,800
eric you can speak in a sec the pers the

2498
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,199
process is not it's not a big deal

2499
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:24,320
it's the same as any other adoption

2500
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,800
yeah thanks rich this is eric

2501
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,040
um i just wanted to so because last time

2502
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,119
i said i would get in touch with iraqi

2503
01:45:31,119 --> 01:45:33,440
and see you know how he feels about it

2504
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,000
and so forth and in my defense i did

2505
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,679
multiple times um but not much progress

2506
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:42,000
was being made so

2507
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,080
i still have i don't know last thing i

2508
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,719
heard from him was that he tried to join

2509
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:49,280
mailing list and i'm not quite sure of

2510
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,440
how the status is there i don't think

2511
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,920
i've seen him on the mating list but at

2512
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,080
least i'm still pinging him

2513
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:58,159
on a regular basis i'll keep doing that

2514
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:00,960
and hopefully um there will be some path

2515
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:03,119
forward i'm not quite sure whether iraqi

2516
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:04,320
has the

2517
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:07,440
the cycles to actually um

2518
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,360
go forward with the draft

2519
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,600
but one way or the other at least

2520
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,440
he knows that that the group is

2521
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,280
interested in the general topic and i'll

2522
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,119
keep the group updated if i make any

2523
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:19,119
progress

2524
01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:21,920
great okay thank you um if it helps to

2525
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,520
you know loop daryl or i into the

2526
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,080
conversation we can help ensure the

2527
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,840
process will be relatively painless

2528
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,920
until it gets to

2529
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,080
as folks know after

2530
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,920
that that's not the limiting factor

2531
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,760
right now yeah

2532
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:39,400
okay good

2533
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,199
okay so i think that leaves us with aov

2534
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:47,440
great

2535
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,639
hey francesca

2536
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:54,800
hello um

2537
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,960
i wanted to ask the chairs and the

2538
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,880
working group to possibly consider

2539
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,119
updating the milestones

2540
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:02,159
um

2541
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:04,239
we don't need to have

2542
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:06,480
i think it's useful to have some sort of

2543
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:09,440
record of you know what's the

2544
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,440
current status of the documents even

2545
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,159
though we have an awesome github project

2546
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:15,520
view now but

2547
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,600
this is a more

2548
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,760
high-level general view

2549
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:20,719
and

2550
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:24,400
we can use the uh next and later and

2551
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,239
last instead of

2552
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,320
dates if you know the working group

2553
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,320
prefers but also

2554
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:33,119
having an idea of what our goals times

2555
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:35,119
are could be useful we don't have to

2556
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:37,920
like be super precise but

2557
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,920
yeah it would help me so

2558
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,760
i want to bring this up right now we

2559
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,400
have no milestones

2560
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,600
got it

2561
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,880
okay

2562
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,159
martin go ahead

2563
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:51,839
and then i'll say something

2564
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:56,159
man that's so slow um

2565
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:57,679
have i've done the research on

2566
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,600
milestones and concluded that having

2567
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,960
dates on them

2568
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,920
is uh probably foolish uh we'd probably

2569
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,600
decide whether whether we wouldn't put a

2570
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,840
date on any more ones in this group as

2571
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:12,239
well i'd sort of advocate the thing no

2572
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:15,360
yeah i i think

2573
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:17,600
yes having some kind of priority or a

2574
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,199
rough you know

2575
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,199
t-shirt size estimate is it will be

2576
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:23,040
worthwhile um

2577
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,199
daryl mark and i can discuss offline

2578
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:27,440
with francesca and

2579
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,280
post them and then see if the working

2580
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,440
group says we got it wrong

2581
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,280
so we'll do that between now and the

2582
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:36,559
next ietf how's that

2583
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,199
thank you

2584
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:42,960
um

2585
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:43,920
okay

2586
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:47,119
you want to mention the twitter thing

2587
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:49,440
daryl

2588
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,280
yes rich and i

2589
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:53,600
discussed that there was the possibility

2590
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,760
of setting up a twitter bot in order to

2591
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,719
provide more feedback to the community

2592
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:04,000
and some more visibility

2593
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,320
i suggested that i think

2594
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,119
twitter is actually quite a

2595
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:12,800
common gathering spot for api community

2596
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:13,760
folk

2597
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:14,719
and so

2598
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:16,719
if we want to get the attention of more

2599
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:18,880
people i think that probably would be a

2600
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,760
good idea so i guess it's just a case of

2601
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:25,040
understanding exactly what events

2602
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,719
we would want

2603
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:28,080
so that we understand what kind of

2604
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,400
frequency that that might

2605
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,080
spam a

2606
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:35,760
audience with notifications

2607
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:37,920
see

2608
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,159
okay

2609
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:42,480
um eric you say you like the hd working

2610

does

2612
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:47,760
folk do folks have uh pointers as to how

2613
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,639
to get that set up

2614
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:54,320

2615
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:55,119
yeah

2616
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:58,000
there's a straight line mark

2617
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,760
sorry we may run out of time before my

2618
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,440
wife becomes active again

2619
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,560

2621
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:07,679
bot that does that um if you have new

2622
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:08,960
features

2623

okay i will talk to you mark

2630
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,840
cool great yeah i think adoption is is

2631
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,679
definitely one we want to put in the

2632
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:33,760
list too because we want to know

2633
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,159
right we want to tell not just

2634
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:37,599
end of the process but the beginning of

2635
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:39,360
the process

2636
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,320
yeah the hard one right now is um

2637
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,159
when when i when you put out a call for

2638
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:46,480
adoption because there's no way to

2639
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:47,920
recognize that easily with the event

2640
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,639
stream the data tracker puts out

2641
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:51,599
but we'll

2642
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:52,960
we'll talk

2643
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,480
yeah okay yeah we can uh

2644
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,320
maybe we can get the tools to change

2645
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,880
mate okay

2646
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,320

all right

2648
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,880
unless

2649
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,639
anybody has something

2650
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:08,639
else to bring up i think we'll give

2651
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:10,239
everybody

2652
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,719
link setting

right thanks you suggested

2654
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:17,920
we do an update on

2655
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,119
uh

2656
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,639
save the best for last

2657
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:24,480
save the best for last

2658
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:28,080
thanks the authors for their patience

2659
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:30,080
and good nature

2660
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:30,960
um

2661
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,960
yes there was one change made in the

2662
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:35,520
last good point one change made after

2663
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,320
the set of isg and

2664
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:41,599
itf reviews which turned two shoulds

2665
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:43,199
into a may

2666
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,360
two shirts into a must sorry for

2667
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:46,719
interrupt

2668
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:49,119
um

2669
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:51,679
i'll post the diff to the list and if

2670
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:53,360
anybody disagrees

2671
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,639
by the end of you know next week

2672
01:51:56,639 --> 01:51:58,639
speak up but

2673
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:00,080
it's just tightening your requirement it

2674
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,840
says you have to do this particular

2675
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,760
thing because it's really required for

2676
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,440
interoperability so therefore it should

2677
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,919
be a must

2678
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,880
so i don't know if eric wants to share

2679
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,320
more in detail but

2680
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,960
since i'm shepherding this through the

2681
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,360
ist process i can say that

2682
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:19,119
uh yeah just

2683
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:21,920
for summary if someone like if people

2684
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,920
haven't followed this but we had to do

2685
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:26,320
another ipf last call because of process

2686
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,639
because some down ref were missed that

2687
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:32,239
were in the um ice so

2688
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:34,960
we started that and it's ending the 28th

2689
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,960
of march and

2690
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,040
um i also requested an

2691
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,560
internationalization

2692
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:42,159
directorate review

2693
01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:44,800
so i hope that will arrive by then and

2694
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,239
um

2695
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:47,840
and after that we're only missing a

2696
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,080
couple of ballots and i

2697
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:52,000
don't think that it will be

2698
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,520
a huge re-review from the whole isg and

2699
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,599
i wanted to thank you the authors for

2700
01:52:57,599 --> 01:52:59,119
answering all the comments and they

2701
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:01,440
already post posted a

2702
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,480
next version version zero nine

2703
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,520
so

2704
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:06,880
it should be

2705
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,080
um

2706
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:10,800
quite painless in my opinion um i'm only

2707
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,199
waiting for the internationalization

2708
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:15,520
review to make sure that we get that

2709
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:20,239
right i am not an expert in the topic so

2710
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:22,560
waiting for their opinion um

2711
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:25,280
since there is an internationalization

2712
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:27,440
section um

2713
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,920
so yeah that that's basically

2714
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,280
from my side

2715
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:33,679
okay so i'll post the note to the list

2716
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:36,159
and and also make it

2717
01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:38,320
if you object respond by the 28th so

2718
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:39,840
that the same deadline applies

2719
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:40,800
everywhere

2720
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,760
and we will get this one in the queue

2721
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,880
yeah and it's in it's up for telechat on

2722
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,800
the 7th of april to get the last

2723
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,920
ballasts that are missing

2724
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:55,520
all right

2725
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,119
um

2726
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:58,639
thanks everyone

2727
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:00,800
i i want to say that

2728
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:03,040
you know this was sort of a

2729
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:06,320
different group for the ietf we have

2730
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,719
i'm very impressed by

2731
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:10,320
all the authors when they go out and

2732
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,159
they say oh i spoke to the opening api

2733
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:14,400
people i spoke to the ammo people

2734
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,840
these are whole communities that are

2735
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,040
certainly new to me as an ietf geek

2736
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:23,599
but i think we're doing a very good job

2737
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:25,520
i think we're bridging

2738
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:28,000
appropriate communities and getting good

2739
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,080
stuff done

2740
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,000
sometimes when

2741
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,239
east meets west there's little friction

2742
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:36,080
and frustration so i appreciate

2743
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:38,080
everybody's patience

2744
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:38,960
um

2745
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,440
eric and herbert particularly most

2746
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:42,400
recently

2747
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,280
um

2748
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,560
but

2749
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,480
we seem to be doing well and that's

2750
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,400
partly why you know that's mainly why

2751
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,400
daryl and i think we can sort of open up

2752
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:53,280
the pipe and take on more bandwidth

2753
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,239
so

2754
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:57,598
stay safe safe healthy

2755
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,360
pray for peace

2756
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:02,360
whatever

2757
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:07,839
thank you everybody for joining me

2758
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,239

2759

2760
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,280

2761
