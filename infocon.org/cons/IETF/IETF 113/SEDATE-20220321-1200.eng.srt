00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
if you're in the room and you have not

yet logged in

29
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,799
to meet echo please either use the qr

30
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,119
code that's up there on the screen or

31
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,759
log in through the the data tracker

32
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,439
there's a link

33
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,360
which i think i've got

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,038
a page tells you about

35
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,760
the note well hopefully everyone has

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,120
seen this already

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,239
um

38
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,400
as we used to say note it well

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,599
there's lots of stuff here that

40
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,160
controls how we behave and and tells us

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,800
what to do and and what we need to say

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
along the way um if you have any

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,680
questions please ask all right

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,720
here's the little tips thing in the meet

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,920
echo

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,080
in the data tracker information for this

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,319
session there's a little online link for

48
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,800
the the minimum tool otherwise you can

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
log in with format echo either way

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,560
you can then add yourself to the queue

51
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,000
if you want to speak

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,760
i think in a session this size we don't

53
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
need to stand too much on ceremony but

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,319
please do log in once through there at

55
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,000
least so that you show up in the blue

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,319
sheets

57
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
there's a bunch of resources which i

58
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
think again most of us know how to find

59
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,519
this if you go to the data tracker the

60
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,280
agenda is right there in one of the

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,080
menus so just data tracker atf.org

62
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,000
everything can be followed from there

63
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
and finally here's the resources for

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,560
this session

65
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
including the notes area if anyone would

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,959
like to pop in there and take notes that

67
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,800
would be very helpful

68
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
i i'll probably pop in there and do some

69
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,560
things as well as we go

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
and

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,200
the mailing list all the information's

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,400
in data tracker

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,159
and this is what we have for the agenda

74
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,360
um

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,560
introduction the liaison uh mark are you

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
in this session as well i can't

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,280
yes excellent yeah if you can can pop in

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,480
as well um and speak to the liaison and

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,480
then we'll we'll get into the

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,119
the draft

81
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
go ahead mark

82
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,120
well the liaison shouldn't even take me

83
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120
two minutes um

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,000
uh the situation is the iep could make a

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,319
selection uh they did communicate that

86
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,920
selection to ice vote iso uh has a very

87
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
formal process for

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
uh vetting and voting on its liaisons

89
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,000
and that process ends next week

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,238
and so on the mailing list i expect to

91
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,680
have an announcement

92
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,199
uh about the iso liaison uh

93
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,360
sometime in the middle of next week

94
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,880
and unless there are questions that's

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,840
all i meant to say

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,040
cool

97
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,160
any questions from anybody

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,840
excellent all right so custom one option

99
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,600
is for me to just bring up the slide

100
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,080
your slides on my screen here and you

101
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,880
can ask me dude

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,960
once more

103
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,000
sorry

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
can you

105
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
give me the slides once more i just

106
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,360
reconnected

107
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,160
yeah i'll give it a go

108
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,320
yeah

109
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,719
that works

110
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,680
okay

111
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,600
so i think i have the next 50 minutes on

112
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,360
the agenda and

113
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
i will

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
try to go through

115
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
wow there's a

116
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,239
big echo here

117
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,080
is anybody else i don't think anyone

118
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,320
else is sending sound

119
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,639
no i think it's the the room that is

120
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,880
actually echoing

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,919
which

122
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,240
shouldn't happen if that is properly set

123
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
up

124
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,560
okay let's see how much i can tune that

125
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,320
out

126
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,560
i can't i can't disable that so we might

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
have to ask me that okay now if you

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,919
disable the room audio it will be very

129
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,479
quiet for you

130
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,120
it's supposed to be

131
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,800
yeah you could disable the the presenter

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
mike i don't know if that is part of

133
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,479
yeah i'll have a guy

134
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,919
because i don't think we will ever

135
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,680
present all right so i'll switch this

136
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,520
off

137
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,639
and now

138
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,880
i can hear

139
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,800
myself

140
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,039
quite as well okay let me just try to

141
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,720
ignore that

142
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
um let's see how yeah

143
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
don't i get at that

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,199
um so i wanted to say if you think about

145
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,120
the status of the current

146
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
uh document then then maybe spend a

147
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,919
couple of minutes confirming the recent

148
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,440
directions

149
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,840
we have taken the draft

150
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,160
then focus on the four

151
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,400
issues that actually need work

152
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,720
and if we actually have time we might

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
want to look at an editorial issue but i

154
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,080
think we will be

155
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,880
way out of time by that in any case

156
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
so right now i think there are nine

157
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,440
issues open on github i didn't

158
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
check this in the last hour

159
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
but it was that way when i prepared

160
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,280
these slides

161
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,639
two of these issues are just in the air

162
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,520
for

163
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,759
potential next round but they are out of

164
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,680
scope for the current

165
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,560
document which are floating times and

166
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
future

167
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,479
times in the sense of calendar planning

168
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,000
one is marked philosophical which

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
means

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,599
um

171
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,440
oh well the feedback is gone thank you

172
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,039
which means that

173
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,120
it's good to have agreement on what we

174
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,560
are trying to achieve here but there

175
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
will be no direct exchanges so if you

176
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,160
have an opinion on on the issue brought

177
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,000
up in number five and what it could mean

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,599
for the current draft

179
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,960
uh please comment there then we have one

180
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,240
issue that is

181
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
already solved but maybe we need to look

182
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,720
at this quickly number two

183
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,360
the editorial one and the

184
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,560
four that

185
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
need

186
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,879
uh work

187
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,639
so the draft version 03

188
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,800
was submitted

189
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,479
at the internet draft deadline and i

190
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,319
think the the main

191
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,039
new item was the simplification we had

192
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,280
agreed at the last last meeting

193
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,520
to no longer try to structure the

194
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
registrations

195
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,759
of extensions into namespaces

196
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,080
so you can now register extensions but

197
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,880
you cannot register namespaces

198
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,399
so any namespaces that might

199
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
happen will happen due to convention

200
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,480
and gentleman's agreement

201
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,320
so that was all three

202
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,800
and four o four we took in one

203
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,240
feature requests which is the support

204
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
for offset

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,360
time zones

206
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,760
which are not your garden variety time

207
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,320
zones where a politician

208
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,360
makes rules on how local time

209
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,399
differs

210
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,880
from universal time

211
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
but it's a

212
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,680
set

213
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
offset

214
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,920
and we have a syntax for that which is

215
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,320
provided by java

216
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,240
and we are essentially just trying to

217
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,720
support that part of the java

218
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
uh libraries by

219
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,399
allowing an offset

220
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,640
uh in the time zone

221
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
part as well

222
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,360
and uh obviously we need to spend a

223
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
little bit more time

224
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,399
actually defining what it means

225
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,320
to have two

226
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,399
potentially two offsets

227
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,080
in a timestamp one the rfc 3539

228
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,120
offset

229
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,160
which is really used to compute

230
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,040
the utc time from the locker time

231
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,200
and this offset

232
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,080
um which is uh well

233
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
could be saying the same thing could be

234
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,440
saying a different thing they don't

235
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
um

236
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,360
compete with each other but the they

237
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,279
the intent of

238
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,839
saying the time zone inside and outside

239
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
the brackets is different

240
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,920
and

241
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
while we are we were doing that

242
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,920
we got

243
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,880
discussion about the meaning of named

244
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,320
ayanna

245
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,920
time zones

246
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,200
and i just went ahead and wrote up

247
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,279
what i think the working group so far

248
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,519
had been discussing but you really have

249
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,560
to read that text and

250
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,399
tell the editors

251
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,320
uh what we need to

252
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,519
fix there so let me go through these

253
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,560
um

254
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,160
so in in the

255
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,360
commit

256
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,959
given there

257
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,079
um

258
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,120
the

259
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,000
text now says that the rules defined for

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
a named ayanna time zone can change over

261
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,440
time

262
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,600
which of course means that the time zone

263
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,120
hint

264
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,959
given in the

265
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
extended timestamp

266
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,760
could

267
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
change over time

268
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
the meaning of the time zone hit and

269
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
what we say here is

270
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,720
that the use of a named ayanna time zone

271
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,040
implies that the intent

272
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,680
is for the rules to be used that are

273
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,560
current at the time of interpretation

274
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,200
so um it's kind of a statement in the

275
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,760
future if the politicians change

276
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,480
what europe paris time

277
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,920
actually is

278
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,399
this is really what we are trying to say

279
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,519
here

280
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,880
and of course the intent may then be in

281
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,600
conflict with uh what the

282
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,560
uh

283
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
actual offset in the system design

284
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,839
timestamp

285
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,279
says so we have to have some conflicting

286
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,800
but we have to have some conflict ending

287
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
in any case because

288
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,880
we

289
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,560
it is possible to create

290
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,720
time extended time

291
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,839
times

292
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,360
that are

293
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,440
internally inconsistent

294
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
so at least we are now

295
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,519
uh alerted to that fact

296
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
and can for instance trigger some user

297
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
interface mechanism or protocol

298
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
mechanism

299
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,639
to clarify

300
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,600
what

301
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,760
that

302
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,800
time stem exam time stamp is actually

303
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
supposed to

304
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,240
mean

305
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,040
okay do you want

306
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,240
people to

307
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,160
speak to this or

308
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,320
if people have an opinion on this so

309
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,440
this would be a good time to state

310
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,480
cool

311
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,800
you're up

312
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,160
am i audible

313
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,519
yep

314
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,200
great uh

315
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,360
just a clarification my

316
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,839
understanding is that in

317
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,839
case of mismatch

318
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,000
between uh

319
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
between whatever offset corresponds to

320
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,720
the

321
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,200
uh the yana time zone at the moment

322
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,920
versus the offset that is

323
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,000
included in the time spam

324
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,040
and and without any mechanism to

325
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,200
say which one to choose the default

326
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,600
behavior would be to trust the offset

327
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
that is within the timestamp is that

328
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,519
correct

329
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,120
well right now it doesn't say

330
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,000
so we would have to write text

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,279
that actually provides

332
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,600
the the intended handling of this

333
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,279
situation

334
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,079
and

335
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,480
from the existing discussion i'm taking

336
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,800
away that this is really highly

337
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,920
application dependent so in the end

338
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,959
you essentially will have to

339
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,040
ask the application what

340
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,800
the the supposed outcome is going to be

341
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,279
right i mean uh yeah i was thinking more

342
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,959
about the case of the application which

343
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,320
doesn't have

344
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,040
the ability to to say prompt a user to

345
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,920
choose

346
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,440
between uh

347
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,959
speaking about the case of temporal

348
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,839
since it is a programming api we can

349
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,199
easily allow the programmer to to write

350
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,800
code in a way

351
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
that would allow them to choose either

352
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,839
behavior

353
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,519
uh

354
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,680
but yeah so so this is something

355
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
this is really interesting thank you

356
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,120
carson because this is something that

357
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,839
came up uh many times in within the

358
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,120
temporals

359
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,320
uh discussions regarding this also

360
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,279
uh

361
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,320
what i stated was my understanding of

362
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,480
the current draft the

363
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,600
i i wanted the draft to to

364
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
uh

365
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
to at least my intention

366
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,199
was that the

367
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,959
uh the offset that is included in the

368
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,040
timestamp is the one that is used to

369
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,560
resolve the

370
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,760
uh

371
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,360
the the instant

372
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,519
and the

373
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,440
the time zone annotation

374
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,839
is an additional bit of information

375
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,760
that could be used for many many things

376
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,839
but

377
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,760
you know also could then be safely

378
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
ignored if not needed

379
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,399
uh

380
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,959
but yeah so my

381
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,839
uh suggestion is that

382
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,560
as long as we have agreement within this

383
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,279
group that trusting

384
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,959
the offset

385
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,079
when

386
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,079
when the

387
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,480
in case of conflicts when

388
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,120
there's no way to to ask for more

389
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,199
clarification

390
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,360
be the default behavior i think we

391
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,759
already have support for this and if so

392
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,839
then then we could just proceed and add

393
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,639
more

394
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,639
text to to make that more explicit

395
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,480
so when you say trusting the offset you

396
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
mean trusting the rfc is a renown offset

397
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,639
yes

398
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,360
so so this would create the effect in

399
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,800
that

400
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
rsc339 implementations

401
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,360
could could easily support the

402
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,560
uh

403
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,120
the the format that we're specifying

404
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,079
by by just ignoring everything after

405
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,440
uh the

406
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,120
the current format

407
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,800
michael

408
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,480
all right we have more people in the

409
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,519
queue mike you're next

410
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
you should be able to just turn on your

411
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,880
audio

412
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,120
yep

413
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,399
okay sorry

414
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,399
yeah i i i have a hard time

415
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,920
accepting accepting that i mean the

416
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
the

417
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,639
the offset

418
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,199
tells you what

419
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,679
you believe the offset to be at the time

420
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,199
the time step was created

421
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,559
and

422
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,720
what you're finding with with

423
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,599
this notation is that at the point it's

424
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,959
used that offset is no longer correct so

425
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,079
what you're saying is you should

426
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,679
actually agree you should actually use

427
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,319
an incorrect offset

428
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,319
no that's not what it says

429
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,240
well no i think that's what what you're

430
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,520
saying is if you

431
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
use the opposite was if you can't if you

432
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,400
can't

433
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,320
check if you can't resolve the conflict

434
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,320
then you default to using the offset

435
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,200
now

436
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,880
you said one very important word which

437
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,919
is use

438
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,880
nobody forces you to use an inconsistent

439
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,440
timestamp

440
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,039
as if it were consistent

441
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,280
so there is an indication in that

442
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,720
timestamp

443
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,799
that there is a problem with with

444
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,960
interpreting it but how you actually

445
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
react to that we haven't specified and i

446
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,520
i would expect that

447
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,240
uh this is exactly what

448
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,120
um

449
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,039
applications want to decide based on

450
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,960
their specific yeah

451
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,640
all right i mean

452
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,520
the

453
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,400
i maybe it's just a matter of of how yes

454
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
how this gets written down i mean the

455
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,280
the point is i guess at the point in

456
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,440
which you use the time stamp if you find

457
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,000
that if you are capable of interpreting

458
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,360
a time zone

459
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
given by name and if you determine that

460
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,160
the actual offset specified in the time

461
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,640
stamp is different from what it current

462
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,160
but it now is

463
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,080
it does at least alert you to the fact

464
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,280
that

465
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,840
there's a problem

466
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
um

467
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,559
you know in in the countering world you

468
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,440
there's

469
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,039
a number of things you probably should

470
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,200
do at that point which is reschedule

471
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
meetings and things

472
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,640
i but what you actually do

473
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,400
is i mean what you should do is

474
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,440
reschedule i guess

475
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,679
um

476
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,840
so yeah okay maybe it's just a matter of

477
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,720
how

478
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,799
of how you see what what you should do

479
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,000
when this is

480
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,840
discovered it's a good thing to have

481
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,480
both in a sense because it it it allows

482
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
you to discover that

483
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,400
the world's changed since you since you

484
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,919
uh wrote down that time step

485
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,320
yep all right um neil you're on yep

486
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,520
all right um

487
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,960
i just wanted i've got echo

488
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
to

489
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
agree with

490
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,640
castings original point which is

491
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,080
that the um

492
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,919
what to do when there's

493
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,200
sorry this echo is driving me mad

494
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,760
mike can you turn your audio

495
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,960
i think i can kick you as well okay

496
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,039
now i just kicked neil because i clicked

497
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,400
at the wrong time sorry neil you'll have

498
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,360
to turn yourself back on

499
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,640
yeah you can also locally switch off

500
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
the audio in the other direction then

501
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,559
you don't hear us anymore but at least

502
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,919
you can take

503
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,640
that's a good idea

504
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,880
okay um

505
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,799
i just wanted to agree with carsten that

506
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,720
i'm still getting this

507
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,440
what to do if you get a conflict here

508
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,960
has to be application specific

509
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,799
um and which is slightly different to

510
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,000
what was saying which is that

511
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,799
if you can't ask the user

512
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,520
it should always default to

513
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,360
uh trusting the offset

514
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,080
uh yeah

515
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,760
sorry i just like i could have you know

516
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,919
anything else

517
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,120
all right so

518
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
what i'm hearing there is a proposal

519
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,280
that that the text say it be application

520
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,919
specific uh what the outcome is rather

521
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:08,640
than

522
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,640
having a hard-coded must be this way

523
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,440
yes but i agree with the original text

524
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,080
that's on the screen here that about the

525
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,400
kind of intent because otherwise why

526
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,240
would you put a time zone at all just

527
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,559
put the offset

528
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,360
cool

529
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,760
you hear me okay uh

530
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,679
yeah did you to respond to uh

531
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,600
to what michael said uh

532
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,640
i think i disagree with with uh

533
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
with this statement that if there is a

534
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
conflict then then

535
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,280
necessarily the offset is wrong in it it

536
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,799
could be either way so

537
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,039
let's say i i schedule an international

538
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,159
meeting

539
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,520
and and somehow the the offset

540
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,400
uh

541
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,720
and you know the tz rules change and now

542
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
the offset is out of

543
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,919
uh

544
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,440
you know it doesn't work with my

545
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,240
timezone anymore uh that still means

546
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,600
that the meeting

547
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
needs to happen at the same instant in

548
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,159
time right so so this is

549
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,159
one of those cases when i'd still want

550
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,320
the meeting to be at the same time

551
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,679
irrespective

552
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,240
at the same offset irrespective of if

553
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,679
the

554
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,880
if the if the tz rules changed and then

555
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,280
then there's of course also cases where

556
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,679
i i would not want that i would want to

557
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,080
to be woken up at 8 a.m every morning

558
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
irrespective of what my local time zone

559
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,919
is so i think either could be

560
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,919
could be useful depending on on the

561
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,440
application is

562
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,600
uh as was mentioned

563
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,640
uh

564
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,120
to respond to what neil said i i agree

565
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,760
like if if the application can make a

566
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,480
call

567
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,360
if

568
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,039
the application has enough context to

569
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,799
make a call let's say

570
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,919
then

571
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,280
then it should be able to do that i was

572
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,840
specifying more about the case

573
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,640
when

574
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,559
when let's say you have a demon running

575
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,799
on a server somewhere which is no

576
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,120
context about what what

577
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,240
does this

578
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
person like

579
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,919
what does this time stamp mean

580
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,120
uh and

581
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,039
you know what do we do

582
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,200
in in that case you know like when

583
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
there's no way to get any

584
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,080
further clarification and there's no way

585
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,200
to tell

586
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,000
uh

587
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
what the original intent was or like

588
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,760
what the overarching use cases

589
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,120
hi this is pete resnick um

590
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,440
and by the way the mic is working

591
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,880
the audio in this room is a little

592
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,159
strange anyway um i actually disagree

593
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,120
with ujwal and uh karsten on this

594
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,440
if you know that you've scheduled a

595
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,320
meeting that will always be at an offset

596
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,799
plus 800

597
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,840
then

598
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,640
why would you add a textual time zone

599
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,039
after that if that hint is providing

600
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,960
nothing that is going to be useful if

601
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
there's a conflict then you should leave

602
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,200
out that hint

603
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,480
if the meeting will be at plus oh 800

604
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,400
then the meeting will be at plus 0 800

605
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,320
and saying that it should be

606
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,799
you know in some chinese time zone that

607
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,760
might change is not useful

608
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,799
and

609
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,960
it seems to me that the right thing to

610
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,679
do is if you're adding the hint that

611
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,799
this is in a textual time zone then your

612
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,799
intention is

613
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,080
that this is a moving target and

614
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,279
the

615
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,440
offset is just what it was when i

616
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,559
created the meeting

617
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,559
if that is not your intent then there

618
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,039
needs to be a way to explicitly mark

619
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,919
that that's not the time zone you want

620
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,440
you're giving the hint for some other

621
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,480
reason

622
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,320
but i i'm trying to figure out what the

623
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,120
use case is of i want the interpretation

624
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,720
to be at the 33 39 offset

625
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
but still add this hint i don't

626
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,240
understand what that use case looks like

627
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,240
so maybe we can give a quick answer here

628
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,440
um so when i'm scheduling a meeting at

629
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,400
uh

630
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,600
8

631
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,720
a.m

632
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
pacific daylight saving time

633
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,520
um then i know that there are going to

634
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,720
be people from all over the world there

635
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,520
and when the us changes their data

636
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,200
setting time which apparently is

637
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,919
happening right now

638
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,279
we we have a solution a problem that

639
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,640
doesn't have

640
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,720
a predefined solution

641
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
and i think the important thing about

642
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
the hint is that it tells us that we

643
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,320
have a problem

644
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,200
and

645
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,320
then we have to run some mechanism to

646
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
reconcile

647
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,120
the timestamp with reality

648
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,000
but

649
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
this is pete again so

650
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,039
if you scheduled it in pacific daylight

651
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,559
time as currently imagined

652
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,279
what is your intent is your intent to

653
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,679
say that if

654
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,320
that definition changes

655
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,080
the meeting has moved and you have to

656
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,799
reinterpret or is your intent that it is

657
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,400
at the 3339 offset if it's the latter

658
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,240
then why are you telling me pacific

659
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,600
daylight time because that's a

660
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,840
meaningless piece of data

661
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,760
well it's meaningful in the context of

662
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,919
an application that

663
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,000
actually shows

664
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,840
appointments because if i have an

665
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,760
appointment that is no longer sharply

666
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,120
defined

667
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,600
because the the people out in the world

668
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,919
think it's in a different uh at a

669
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,080
different point in time than the people

670
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,919
in california

671
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,880
then i have a problem and acting as if i

672
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,039
had i didn't have a problem

673
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,720
it's not useful

674
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,520
so

675
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,880
no sorry you're gonna have to repeat

676
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,279
that i didn't understand if if your

677
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,480
intent is that it will be at a

678
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,600
particular offset not related to the

679
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
textual time zone name why are you

680
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,840
providing me with the textual time zone

681
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,959
what does that add

682
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,760
if i'm an end user not the person hand

683
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,720
constructing this this artifact over the

684
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,200
wire my intent is i'd like it to be in

685
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
pacific time at this time of day

686
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,080
and encoding both those bits of

687
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,240
information in the data format allows

688
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,960
that intent to be transferred to another

689
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,320
system in a way that the other system

690
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,159
can understand i mean pacific time not

691
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,640
just -800 right

692
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,919
in a way that it knows that i meant

693
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,840
pacific time

694
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,799
there and for the end user that matters

695
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,720
sure you could say over the y you don't

696
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,679
need to add the time zone name if

697
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,679
if your intent is just to say the exact

698
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,000
time stamp but the the idea of this is

699
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,600
to transfer that information between

700
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,559
systems

701
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,760
including the user's intent

702
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,320
but the the time that they might want to

703
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,399
lock in might be the hard coded time

704
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,960
there's no easy way in this format to to

705
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,880
say which one's more important and i did

706
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
make a proposal a while back which we

707
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,120
decided was too complex to have a way to

708
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,440
tag which one matters i i'm still not

709
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,880
understanding

710
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,080
if the intent of the user

711
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,279
is

712
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,760
fixed minus o 800

713
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,919
that's what they intend

714
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,919
they want to see that on their personal

715
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,279
system

716
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,159
well the person said well now that's a

717
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,320
different question right

718
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,360
if the user has no intent

719
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,399
that the system can interpret

720
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,840
then the system has to have a default of

721
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,720
what that means

722
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
trying to work out now that's right

723
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,799
and my my feeling is closer to michael's

724
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,840
that the general intent of the user if

725
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,120
they say

726
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,559
pacific time

727
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,440
they mean whatever pacific time is going

728
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,480
to be from now and into the future

729
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
now we you may disagree with that you

730
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,440
may think that no system wise we should

731
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,120
design this such that if the user says

732
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,360
pacific time today

733
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,320
and it moves to 0.700

734
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,600
then

735
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,720
to minus 0700 then we should

736
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,840
move the meeting and ignore that it's

737
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,960
labeled pacific time but if that is the

738
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,320
system's default the system need not add

739
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,720
the pacific time to the timestamp

740
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,240
because someone on the other end of the

741
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,520
world doesn't care that it was labeled

742
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,080
by the original user as pacific time

743
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,760
yeah but the user themself when they

744
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,080
transfer between systems does care

745
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,240
and this is this is a data interchange

746
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,640
format that's not just for the use case

747
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
you're imagining it's also for the use

748
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,799
case where you are storing your own

749
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,399
information and coming back to it later

750
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,840
or where you're transferring it between

751
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,559
systems and having that annotation is of

752
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,120
value to the user even if it's not the

753
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,720
primary intent if that is

754
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
the reason it's being used then it

755
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,200
should have an explicit marker one way

756
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,240
or the other i don't care which one

757
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
decide what you want the default to be

758
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,399
and make the other one have an explicit

759
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,600
marker

760
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,279
making it a guess is the worst possible

761
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,039
choice yes

762
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,960
i think the difference here is that you

763
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,880
are assuming that the system must

764
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,960
automatically resolve

765
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,559
any nonsense that politicians do

766
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,720
and i don't think that's possible

767
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,360
so it's really useful to have

768
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,720
time exams

769
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,159
that say hey i'm inconsistent we have

770
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,080
planned something that no longer works

771
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,760
in the real world

772
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,760
please supply new information

773
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,080
ken you are next in the queue uh ken

774
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,279
murchison so

775
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,720
pete pretty much said everything that i

776
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,919
had come up here to

777
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:10,960
to say

778
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,919
the the issue we have here is that we're

779
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,840
we're extending three through three nine

780
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,679
so we can't strip off the numeric time

781
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,799
zone

782
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,399
so there's an artifact that we're stuck

783
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,200
with even if all we really want is the

784
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,039
iana time zone

785
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,399
so i'm going to agree with pete's

786
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,679
suggestion that we actually have a

787
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,039
marker

788
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,480
where the user can

789
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
suggest their intent or determine the

790
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,360
intent

791
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,799
or i haven't read 3339 recently

792
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,720
but perhaps we can steal something from

793
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,039
eight five three six which is

794
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,360
if you use a negative

795
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,080
uh use negative zero zero zero zero as

796
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,360
the offset

797
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,559
which is considered nonsensical in

798
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,159
eight five three six

799
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,679
that might be a marker that we could use

800
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,320
to say i'm here just as a placeholder i

801
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,880
what i really want is the iono time zone

802
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,559
now whether that causes a conflict with

803
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,399
three three three nine i have not re uh

804
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,679
researched that

805
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,679
um plus and minus zero might be treated

806
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,760
the exact same way in which case my

807
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
suggestion is useless but something to

808
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,158
look into

809
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,440
all right i think mike you're next

810
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,080
so i yeah i was just

811
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,360
on the point of maybe i i let me just

812
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,080
hang

813
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,360
i think people are saying what i was

814
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,559
going to say anyway um i i i just i

815
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,519
think i think you should treat it as a

816
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,480
flag

817
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,320
to indicate that

818
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,480
i think what you said is is that

819
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
um

820
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,000
this is what i thought the offset was at

821
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,320
the time that this is written down but

822
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,640
now it's not the same the the point i

823
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,880
think really is that the local time is

824
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,960
really what matters to people

825
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,519
and and this does give you an indication

826
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,320
that the calculation has changed since

827
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,799
since it was written down

828
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,440
we can't just say it's got to be at this

829
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,880
given time

830
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,799
this given offset or this this given the

831
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,039
utc because that that means that your

832
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,440
local time is moving around

833
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,960
and people may have other commitments

834
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,159
which we can't figure out so it really

835
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,600
does come down to sort of having to

836
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,320
reschedule things

837
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,880
okay usual you are the final person in

838
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,080
the queue i think we should probably

839
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
close it after this and i'll try and

840
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,720
summarize what i've heard

841
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,200
hello uh one of the

842
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,679
things that i wanted to sort of first to

843
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,440
answer to pete

844
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,440
uh about why would we need the the

845
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,679
informative tag if

846
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,399
uh all we care about is for the for the

847
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,120
resolution of the incident is the offset

848
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,240
is

849
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,360
uh

850
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,440
is is because

851
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,559
when

852
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,559
the meeting event meeting is scheduled

853
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,399
and you have a time stamp

854
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,000
uh you can

855
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,560
even if you follow

856
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,480
what's mentioned in the timestamp right

857
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,639
if you follow the offset that doesn't

858
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,320
mean that when doing things like

859
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,719
arithmetic you cannot take things like

860
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,000
dst or time zone changes into account

861
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,079
another issue that i wanted to raise

862
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,119
with

863
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,879
with the behavior that was suggested

864
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:25,918
which was

865
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,719
uh to to uh

866
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,159
trust

867
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,280
the tzdb is that uh

868
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,918
i i don't think there's a way to to make

869
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,000
sure that everybody's on the same page

870
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,960
when it comes to tcdb right so

871
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,839
if

872
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,119
if i say

873
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,079
that that we should trust the tz rules

874
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,800
and and my computer has a new version of

875
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,639
the tg rules which

876
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,320
points to

877
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,399
an updated offset

878
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,639
but but my colleagues do not that does

879
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,160
that mean that they would

880
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
be prompted to to attend a meeting at

881
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,839
the at the wrong time

882
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,200
yeah i think we have had a good

883
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,960
discussion here and have to take that to

884
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,760
the

885
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,839
list

886
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,880
and

887
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,400
yeah peter's

888
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,520
on the

889
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,400
chat

890
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,400
again using the word trust which is

891
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,440
not a meaningful concept here

892
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,839
so

893
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,160
um there is no trust somebody sits in

894
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,760
front of their computer and tries to

895
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,720
make something happen and

896
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,040
the world is unfortunately working

897
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,359
against that and

898
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,280
we have to find a way to yeah it's the

899
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,119
intended offset but other people have

900
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,000
agreed to that and they have agreed to

901
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,760
that based on the old meaning of the

902
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,200
time zone

903
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,480
now you have a new meaning so how how

904
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,520
true is that agreement still

905
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,440
and um i think that that's a problem

906
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,920
that cannot be solved at the level of of

907
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,200
this uh

908
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,880
time step it's something that the

909
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,280
application needs to solve

910
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,680
all right the if i could just summarize

911
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,359
what i've heard there was fairly strong

912
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,440
indication from a lot of people that

913
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,839
there needs to be an explicit decision

914
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,640
somehow either explicitly it's always

915
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,480
the zone explicitly it's always the

916
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,599
offset or something added to the format

917
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,560
that says explicitly what the intent of

918
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,880
the creator of this timestamp is

919
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,119
um i don't know if there was a

920
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:33,920
a

921
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,359
which of these are acceptable or

922
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,119
unacceptable people but it has to be an

923
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,680
explicit somehow

924
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,920
not just a best guess

925
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,079
does that seem like a fair summary

926
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,839
um pete's hopping up to the microphone

927
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,078
again

928
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,320
this is pete resnick i think that's

929
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,599
close

930
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,880
i i think

931
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,240
the

932
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,440
the important bottom line

933
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,160
is that

934
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,319
you've got to decide

935
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,599
what

936
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,800
the markers mean

937
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,560
so if you want there to be

938
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,520
a case where

939
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,839
i'm giving you something but i'm not

940
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,760
sure what it means there needs to be a

941
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,640
default interpretation

942
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
and i think that's the crux of the

943
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,160
disagreement

944
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,800
is if the system wants to express i've

945
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,520
been given an offset a numeric offset

946
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,359
and i've been given

947
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,079
a textual time zone name

948
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,119
and i

949
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,599
i the system have not been able to

950
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,640
assess

951
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,839
the creator's intent there must be an

952
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,680
interpretation that is my default

953
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,920
behavior that i am expressing

954
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,800
that

955
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,119
there is no point at which

956
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,480
systems

957
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,119
do not know the

958
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,960
correct intent

959
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,680
and are picking two different outcomes

960
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
so there's got to be a default

961
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,599
interpretation that's given and then

962
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,839
explicit markers that say i know the

963
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,000
intent and this is what it is yeah but

964
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,599
that that could be solved either way by

965
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,520
the draft saying it's always this or by

966
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,359
having a mark that that's right and and

967
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,320
i that's that's the clarification is

968
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
there's got to be a default

969
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,079
interpretation for i don't know but

970
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,079
everyone's going to assume that it's and

971
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,160
it sounds like the answer is everybody's

972
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,520
going to assume that it's the numeric

973
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,119
offset

974
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,880
and then there's got to be an explicit

975
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,359
marker which says no in this case

976
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,560
i don't want you to interpret that as

977
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,440
the numeric offset i want you to always

978
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,040
the intent of the user was i want you to

979
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,880
interpret the textual time zone name

980
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,359
all right

981
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,280
thanks pete

982
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,560
is that

983
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,040
so the next step here is to take this to

984
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,720
list to discuss

985
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,800
um or to a github issue and then the

986
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,920
list i guess

987
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
carsten

988
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,280
yeah um i can just add to

989
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,880
what pete just said

990
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,920
um the the first

991
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,680
choice

992
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,800
is an rfc 539 timestamp

993
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,599
the second choice isn't

994
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,040
so the the fact that we are trying to

995
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,119
extend three three nine here

996
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,400
kind of binds our hands as to what the

997
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
default choice can be

998
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,960
which is in many cases definitely is to

999
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,359
be the wrong choice so calling it a

1000
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,480
default choice uh means you are hiding a

1001
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,560
problem you know of a problem but then

1002
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,720
you are not telling anyone by

1003
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,880
taking a default action that is not the

1004
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,480
desired one

1005
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,240
um so yeah

1006
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,560
it would be nicer if we had a way to

1007
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,760
actually say

1008
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,200
um this particular one is an rsc339

1009
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,160
timestamp and that other one over there

1010
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,440
is not and it's based on the time zone

1011
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,200
intent

1012
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,119
but right now we are stuck in in the

1013
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,119
first corner of the landscape

1014
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,440
okay um yeah the the x-dash problem i'm

1015
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,920
just bringing this up um i mean the

1016
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,560
draft is clear what uh

1017
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,400
how our solution to the exchange problem

1018
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,079
is

1019
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,880
but i just wanted to to point out

1020
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,520
uh we have this leading underscore for

1021
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,440
experiments i strongly believe there

1022
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,240
needs to be a way to do experiments

1023
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,200
and uh the wording is very clear that

1024
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,319
this must not be used for interchange

1025
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,880
so any application that uses this for

1026
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,440
for interchange

1027
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,520
is is non-conforming

1028
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,599
and then of course we know that people

1029
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,920
still will be doing what they were just

1030
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,839
told not to do

1031
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,440
but i think this is about the the best

1032
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,240
thing we can do

1033
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,680
so maybe that's also something we can

1034
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,520
discuss on the list unless somebody has

1035
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,960
a strong knee jerk reaction

1036
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,400
good

1037
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,680
um

1038
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,839
on microphone are you still and did you

1039
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,359
have something to say here

1040
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,760
oh sorry no let me let me meet myself

1041
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,640
cool thanks

1042
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,680
okay so i think we just discussed the

1043
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,839
content of

1044
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,520
this

1045
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,480
slide

1046
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,319
so i don't have to

1047
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,920
repeat

1048
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,359
that

1049
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,839
so the the next question that came up

1050
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,280
was do we have

1051
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,200
any information

1052
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,599
in those extension tags

1053
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,079
that must be understood the elective

1054
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,000
versus critical

1055
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,440
issue

1056
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,119
the text of the current draft is very

1057
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,440
clear all tags are

1058
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,839
optional optional is a bad word because

1059
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,839
of course every tag is optional you can

1060
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,839
always decide not to put it there but

1061
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,240
what is meant here is that if the tag is

1062
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,560
there and you don't understand it or you

1063
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,240
don't want to do it

1064
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,640
you ignore it

1065
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,920
and

1066
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,599
the question was should we include

1067
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,400
syntax to mark a certain tag critical

1068
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,280
and

1069
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,839
we started discussing this but for some

1070
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,319
just seeing pete's

1071
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,119
chat

1072
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,880
item and i definitely agree

1073
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
the question is

1074
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,359
do we want to complete this discussion

1075
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,680
or do we want to ignore the need for

1076
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,440
critical

1077
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,520
extensions

1078
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,200
so last time

1079
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
we had these

1080
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,680
syntax proposals so for instance you

1081
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,079
could say that

1082
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,070
the the information that a calendar

1083
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,480
[Music]

1084
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,000
on the

1085
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,880
hebrew system is desirable

1086
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,800
that would be a hint and if you cannot

1087
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,680
do that you just ignore it or you could

1088
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,319
say something like uh

1089
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,280
the calendar is critical so if you

1090
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,680
cannot show it this way don't show it at

1091
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,400
all

1092
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,160
reject the date

1093
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,720
and there was an alternative syntax

1094
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,680
proposed with the exclamation mark

1095
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,839
at the start and that has the advantage

1096
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,680
that can be applied to the time zone

1097
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,520
hint as well so that

1098
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,720
may be part of the solution to the the

1099
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,520
issue we just previously

1100
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,480
discussed but we need a syntax and i i

1101
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,400
don't want to design the syntax in this

1102
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,000
meeting

1103
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,119
but i want to get people to reply to the

1104
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,800
issue or to send something to the

1105
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,800
meetings

1106
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,800
so anybody who thinks we should not be

1107
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,720
doing elective physics critical at all

1108
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,359
pete asks what does reject mean well

1109
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,800
not act

1110
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,440
on that

1111
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,960
one

1112
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,720
go ahead

1113
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,680
uh

1114
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,359
i one thing that i want to say

1115
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,560
about this proposal is that while it

1116
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,160
solves a lot of the problems that we

1117
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,680
just talked about

1118
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,880
uh

1119
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,680
we

1120
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,520
one of the goals that that we had was to

1121
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,680
was to allow certain implementations

1122
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,040
that already

1123
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,200
follow part of this standard as sort of

1124
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,040
a de facto

1125
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,359
non-standard format would continue to

1126
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,720
keep working

1127
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,280
but including this

1128
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,240
would

1129
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,079
make them also non-compliant so they

1130
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,000
need to actually change go back and

1131
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,319
change

1132
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,280
yeah we essentially have the choice to

1133
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,520
do this now to do this later

1134
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,400
and

1135
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,640
the the damage during this later will be

1136
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,319
larger than the damage during this now

1137
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,440
yeah that's that's fair i

1138
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,160
i don't want to i'm not against the

1139
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,160
proposal just just pointing out one of

1140
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,759
the potential drawbacks

1141
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,119
dude

1142
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,480
yeah this is pete bresnik um

1143
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,720
i'm trying to get my head around what it

1144
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,000
means to reject the date

1145
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,040
so

1146
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,640
in the previous discussion we were

1147
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,720
talking about well

1148
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,520
um

1149
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,560
you know

1150
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,319
you might

1151
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,640
interpret the date to mean the numeric

1152
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,200
time zone you might interpret the date

1153
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,960
uh depending on what markers or what

1154
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,119
your defaults were to be the textual

1155
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,760
time zone and that the other piece was

1156
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,319
the the hint but

1157
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,920
i mean if i'm running a calendar system

1158
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,760
and i get an event

1159
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,079
and i support this extension and i get

1160
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,760
an event that has a critical thing that

1161
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,359
i don't understand

1162
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,839
what am i meant to do

1163
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,079
tell the user i got this uh request for

1164
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,920
a meeting for you but i don't know what

1165
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,440
time it is

1166
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,400
or

1167
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,319
when when would i

1168
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,560
what what does reject mean

1169
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,200
uh uh practically performed what's that

1170
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,880
treat has malformed the same way you

1171
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,640
would if it was if it just had some

1172
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,560
random gibberish rather than an actual

1173
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,119
date in that field and so whatever i do

1174
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,880
with random gibberish i should do to

1175
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,119
this okay

1176
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,640
it's an interesting implementation

1177
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,319
question

1178
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:39,920
yeah it gives you a really strong

1179
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,400
incentive never to send these things

1180
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,119
unless you really have to

1181
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,440
because this prevents falls into

1182
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,440
mobility

1183
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,839
while you're still in the queue

1184
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,720
okay

1185
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,839
yeah so

1186
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,760
i think that that's another clear let's

1187
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,000
take this to the list

1188
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,119
then we have a little problem

1189
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,359
we don't really have a good name for the

1190
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,800
thing

1191
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,079
and

1192
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,760
the draft currently calls it the

1193
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,760
internet date type for date time format

1194
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,520
which is not really very sharply defined

1195
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,880
and

1196
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,240
also a little bit overpretentious

1197
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,880
we could call it extended rfc 3339

1198
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,960
and i'm looking for proposals that are

1199
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,839
even worse

1200
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,240
informative timestamps

1201
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,240
anyone

1202
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,200
says extended is fine

1203
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,480
and john wants not so random gibberish

1204
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,920
nice

1205
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,680
all right we have about 10 minutes left

1206
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,760
in the session um yeah how are we going

1207
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,280
time wise

1208
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,880
two more slides

1209
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,880
cool

1210
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,920
okay then um

1211
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,480
the the whole point of the

1212
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,880
draft right now is to define an

1213
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,920
extension format

1214
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,119
plus

1215
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,880
one thing that doesn't fit that

1216
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,559
extension format

1217
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,680
which is not necessarily an indication

1218
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,119
of of

1219
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,119
having achieved the highest quality for

1220
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,119
this extension format

1221
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,559
and i think

1222
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,760
to to make this practical proposal

1223
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,839
we need to have at least one extension

1224
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,119
defined

1225
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,480
that people actually may want to use

1226
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,079
because if they

1227
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,839
look at this and decide i don't really

1228
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,359
have an extension right now why why

1229
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,160
would they implement that

1230
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,440
so the

1231
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,760
my proposal would be to define something

1232
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,359
and

1233
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,359
the the one thing that

1234
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,880
maybe is

1235
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,440
most well understood at this point in

1236
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,720
time

1237
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,280
is giving a calendar hint

1238
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,839
based on the ca

1239
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,680
locale

1240
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,920
information however that thing is called

1241
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,119
in the unicode tr

1242
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,119
and the advantage of actually doing

1243
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,040
something like this is

1244
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,800
that we would get to look at issues like

1245
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,119
is the alphanumeric

1246
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,520
space we have currently have for both

1247
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,200
labels and values

1248
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,040
the right thing

1249
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,960
probably want to stick with alphanumeric

1250
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,559
for the labels

1251
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,480
but even that

1252
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,400
there may be use cases where that's

1253
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,000
suboptimal

1254
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,280
but we may or may not want to

1255
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,920
include further characters in in the

1256
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,280
values and

1257
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,720
the

1258
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,480
worst case of course is

1259
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,640
that we decide to actually include all

1260
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,559
of unicode there because there is a good

1261
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,640
reason to do that in an extension

1262
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,280
so that that's again one thing we have

1263
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,160
to

1264
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,480
define now

1265
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,240
um so we

1266
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,400
keep this extension point

1267
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,640
open for people to

1268
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,720
define something in there

1269
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,880
and uh well maybe we even can do

1270
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,319
something useful

1271
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,680
while we are

1272
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,640
providing this at least one extension

1273
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,040
with the document so if you have other

1274
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,640
proposals

1275
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,359
what we should define as an extension

1276
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,280
tag

1277
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,800
this this would be very interesting

1278
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,359
so temporal needs

1279
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,359
calendars

1280
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,040
cool so ishwar said uh yeah temple needs

1281
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,000
calendars in the chat

1282
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,440
yeah uh just verified b

1283
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,760
i i'm very supportive of the proposal

1284
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,839
and and one of the other benefits for

1285
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,920
you carson is that i'd be

1286
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,400
more than happy to to help out with this

1287
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,400
as much as you want

1288
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,720
great

1289
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,599
so could the no takers please note that

1290
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,800
uh is writing a pr for number four

1291
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,240
yep

1292
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,200
um and then we

1293
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,079
have the age old editorial question do

1294
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,800
you write abn f productions bottom up or

1295
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,880
do you write them top down

1296
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,800
and 339 has chosen to write them bottom

1297
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,920
up

1298
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,839
so it starts with

1299
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:54,880
some

1300
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,160
random irrelevant syntactic detail and

1301
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,119
then combines these things anymore

1302
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,839
somehow before

1303
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:06,000
the the actual

1304
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,880
production that defines the the the

1305
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,640
content of the draft is somewhere in the

1306
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,800
middle and then there is another set of

1307
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,240
productions

1308
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,960
that follow for some reason

1309
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,119
so i'm essentially asking for a license

1310
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,040
here to

1311
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,119
change the sequence which doesn't have a

1312
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,599
semantic meaning but

1313
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,720
maybe used to people who read 2539

1314
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,640
change the sequence to the top down

1315
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,839
anyone want to speak to that i

1316
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,760
imagine it's fine but

1317
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,559
if you have any objections speak up

1318
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,839
pete doesn't care

1319
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,640
great

1320
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,040
that's it

1321
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,240
excellent thank you

1322
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,760
um

1323
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,680
so far we have

1324
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,200
that the final thing on my list was

1325
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,359
milestones uh we have a milestone for

1326
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,480
august 2021 to adopt the draft

1327
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,319
um which is

1328
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,760
done um but it's i need to area director

1329
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,440
to accept the milestone so i can click

1330
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,559
it it's done

1331
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,200
sorry

1332
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,720
resolve just done actually i can i can

1333
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,400
just do that and then it'll go off to

1334
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,559
you to get approved anyway

1335
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,040
um and the other one is submit the draft

1336
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,280
to asg for publication which is

1337
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,160
obviously not going to happen in

1338
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,680
december 2021 we're waiting for the iso

1339
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,839
liaison which should come through next

1340
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:46,720
week

1341
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,599
it sounds like the one big piece of

1342
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,440
debate we still have is how we're going

1343
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,880
to indicate

1344
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,480
the important

1345
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,960
what is more important out of the offset

1346
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,280
or the time zone name is there anything

1347
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,559
else

1348
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,480
that we think is is going to block us

1349
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,599
and what kind of timeline are we

1350
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,920
thinking here

1351
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,920
i guess casting you're probably best

1352
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,520
place to guess

1353
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,880
where we should put this milestone

1354
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,280
yeah it can't really take that long i

1355
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,680
don't think we we will open up a new

1356
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,520
construction site here

1357
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,359
um except for the ones that are already

1358
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,960
on the slide

1359
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,839
but of course the the details of

1360
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,319
conflicting hints and elective versus

1361
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,359
critical

1362
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,440
will probably take another couple of

1363
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,720
months to

1364
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,079
clarify

1365
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,520
and it helps if people actually

1366
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,480
follow the github and our meeting list

1367
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,040
discussions and and comment

1368
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,880
there so we we

1369
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,799
had a little bit of a break in the

1370
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,559
discussion and

1371
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,880
uh have been speeding up again and i

1372
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,520
think we don't really need another break

1373
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,920
to finish

1374
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,559
all right so hopefully we can finish

1375
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,040
i've put june 2022

1376
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,400
essay a potential date for this

1377
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,599
do you think we're going to need another

1378
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,240
interim meeting to get there or will

1379
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,599
will mailing list

1380
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,240
discussion be sufficient

1381
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,079
to a single

1382
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,240
open discussion item

1383
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,000
also since this is

1384
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,839
this is the one that took the longest

1385
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,000
for temple to wrap their head around

1386
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,880
uh

1387
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,520
i'm glad that out of all of them is this

1388
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,319
one

1389
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,400
uh we have my

1390
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,640
feeling is that this could be easily

1391
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,760
resolved

1392
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,000
in the mailing list

1393
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,720
person do you disagree with that

1394
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,118
it could i don't agree with that

1395
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,240
all right i think it's good to have

1396
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,160
white stones so having an interim

1397
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,960
meeting maybe end of may

1398
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,839

1399
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,799
all right we'll we'll pencil in interim

that we need a manual mute button on

1442

this microphone so we can turn it off
