1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,520
as you're less likely to be broadcasting

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,840
audio or have your mic on or feedback or

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,240
something

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,038
that's true that is definitely a feature

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,760
and also if you happen to be here in

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,800
person

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,560
i have a shiny

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,079
timer thing and if the chairs happen to

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,760
mention how long your presentation slot

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,600
is i will try and set that and so you

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,320
can know how much time you have left

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,640
um

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,719
yeah

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,719
and as you can probably tell i am

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,800
neither fred nor ron i am just the

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,960
monkey who's sitting in the chair

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
largely to try and keep order in the

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,000
room

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,800
um

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,120
so you know if anybody misbehaves at the

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,559
mic or something

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,800
i'm the bouncer for for ensuring

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
compliance

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,039
he will comply

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,479
let's see

26
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,840
let's make sure that these mics work

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,960
um

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,400
warren are you running with pledge as

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,640
well

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,159
could you repeat that i missed it

31
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,560
this is fred uh are you running the

32
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,880
slides as well

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,680
i believe that y'all the chairs are

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
doing the slide

35
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,960
bits

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,479
because i don't know what order things

37
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,920
go in so

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
well

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560
they go in the order they are on the

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
meeting materials site

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,679
okay let me see if i can get that logged

42
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,759
in

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,120
one of the problems is

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,000
i

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,040
don't

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,599
have an easy way for people to change to

47
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
the next slide

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,120
because i do not have a clicker thing

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
um

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,080
so i can't hand people a clicker or if

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,519
they need to change their slide if

52
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,120
they're here in person

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,319
okay then they'll have to um

54
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,879
don't have to ask us to go to the next

55
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,319
slide

56
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,200
so i'm looking at the choose deck to

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
chair

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,720
and it shows two

59
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,680
sets of slides the deploy the first and

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
last

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,360
do i have to share from here then

62
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,680
i didn't i missed the question can

63
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,200
somebody in the room repeat it

64
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,200
i mean if the chairs would like i can do

65
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,319
the slide sharing from in the room

66
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,400
so that people can say next and i can

67
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,159
push the next button otherwise if

68
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,599
anybody has a usbc to usb a converter i

69
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,599
can plug in a clicker thing i'm only

70
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,360
slightly terrified about plugging a

71
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
random

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
does that have a converter

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,480
converter

74
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,400
grey

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
it's a corporate machine i'm sure it's

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
safe

77
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,200
okay warren i have all of these slides

78
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,840
up at the meeting materials site but for

79
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,799
some reason uh when i choose a deck to

80
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,040
share it only shows two sets of slides

81
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
i will remind people that this is the

82
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,400
first meeting of

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,200
the ietf

84
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,920
and so the logistics are always a little

85
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,920
fun

86
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,639
hello

87
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,000
can you hear me

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,720
yes hi juan carlos here i i attended

89
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,960
amitako uh training yesterday and there

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,680
are a couple of features so first of all

91
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,400
the the chairs need to to share the

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,479
slides so they have to prepare them

93
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,240
uh second for moving the slides uh if

94
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,080
someone scans the qr code with their

95
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,919
phone they can actually move ahead and

96
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,280
back so that you don't need to get the

97
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,240
pointer

98
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
the

99
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
they just have to request permission to

100
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,320
control the presentation and then anyone

101
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,759
from the phone can

102
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,400
actually control the the back and forth

103
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,000
of the slides

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
if that's uh more convenient so that we

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,320
don't have to pass around stuff

106
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,000
and there we go i'm just waiting for

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,039
data tracker to log me in

108
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,039
and i just closed the wrong tab

109
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,360
sorry everybody

110
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,240
okay i'm trying to share from my laptop

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,320
and uh the the system doesn't want to do

112
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,440
that for some reason

113
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,800
yeah and meeting materials is broken

114
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
um

115
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,960
there we go i should be able to do it

116
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,479
okay good

117
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,800
uh the first set of slides is in

118
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,800
administrative

119
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,880
that's the last set of slides

120
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,960
yeah um

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,280
let's see

122
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,520
so the only set of slides that i see is

123
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,720
deployment state status

124
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
and

125
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,919
i see two decks list

126
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,360
and the things

127
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,160
ipv6 deployment and ipv6 ups working

128
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,639
group procedures

129
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,800
okay

130
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,759
let's see if i can share from here

131
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,240

137
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,840
no it's not letting me share either

138
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,080
i'm going back to seeing video of the

139
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,080

159
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,959

10 minutes

185
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,120
let's just pretend that this is full

186
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,720
screen and not deal with trying to make

187
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,519
it actually fit because

188
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,640
okay

189
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,760
well okay guess what you're in visa

190
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,680
corporations and we're trying to figure

191
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,519
out how to make this work

192
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,399
uh next slide

193
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,800
uh okay

if you haven't seen a note well screen

195
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
before you see one now

196
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,120
uh and basically

197
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,959
you you should remember the things you

198
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,880
say here you

199
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,839
um

200
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,720
have legal significance and so you know

201
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,560
don't be stupid

202
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,199
uh next slide

203
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,279
i clicked it waiting

204
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,480
okay so i see it now meeting pip

205
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,279
uh

206
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,839
he's playing in using meat echo using

207
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,519
the onsite do and use it to join the mic

208
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,600

211
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,160
unless you're intending to speak

212
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,279
if you're intending to speak a headset

213
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,760
probably work well

214
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
next slide

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,320
these are some good things to know

216
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,760
and next slide

217
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,040
so this is our agenda today

218
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,959
um

219
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,680
question does anybody have any changes

220
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,120
that they would like to make to the

221
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,839
agenda

222
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,399
hearing none

223
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,240
this is the agenda that we'll use

224
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,680
and

225
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
now the first speaker is talking about

226
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,720
the deployment process before are you

227
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,040
around

228
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,519
trying to get the next slides up

229
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,519
yeah

230
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,320
come stand in the pink box which isn't

231
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,519
actually pink or mocked and sadly you're

232
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,880
gonna have to say next and i'm gonna

233
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,600
have to click next

234
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
does anybody mind if they reverse the

235
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,959
mosque so you can speak at the mic

236
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
so good morning my name is paolo volpato

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
i'm presenting on behalf of the coders

238
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,600
you see listed here and we are talking

239
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,279
about the

240
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,160
draft on the deployment of ipv6

241
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,120
next slide please

242
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,000
so just to give you a bit of the history

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,800
of the draft you see that we submitted

244
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,160
as the

245
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,920
personal version in um

246
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,240
it was october 2020 in april 2021 it was

247
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,639
accepted by the working group as a work

248
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,160
group draft

249
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,199
and

250
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,279
basically we

251
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,720
completely

252
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,839
reviewed the draft

253
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,839
for itf 111 it was a version zero two so

254
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,680
we did the kind of uh

255
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,600
major transformation we introduced a lot

256
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,360
of changes we reshaped the table of

257
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,199
content

258
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,240
um

259
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,440
and uh

260
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,160
let's say since version zero two the the

261
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,639
draft can be considered as stable enough

262
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,639
after atf 111 we had three other

263
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,959
versions but basically those versions

264
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,959
were let's say

265
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,959
prepared to address the comments raised

266
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,720
by you by the working group

267
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,440
uh and we are now at version zero five

268
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,680
by the way you see uh they are the list

269
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,760
of people who contributed in the

270
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,560
discussion and there are others who also

271
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
provided comments offline

272
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,720
so the next slide is

273
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,040
good so where we are right now as i said

274
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,639
version zero t was uh uh let's say

275
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,680
done

276
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,399
to address the comments received for atf

277
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,880
111

278
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,800
we touched the table of content but

279
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,040
since then it has remained stable stable

280
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,920
enough

281
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,759
and the other

282
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,240
changes we did mainly in version zero

283
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,079
four and zero five

284
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,800
were to let's say update the numbers

285
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
about the deployment and the adoption of

286
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,839
ipv6 and we touched also the text

287
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,279
for example

288
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,880
addressing comments

289
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,079
um asking to introduce new references to

290
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,120
avoid the ambiguity of some terms so you

291
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
see an example there for example remove

292
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,639
migration to ipv6 just use the term

293
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,959
transition 286 or let's say expand what

294
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,199
we considered as the base text for

295
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,800
example please

296
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,360
uh explain a bit more the behavior of a

297
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,279
happy eyeball so that

298
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,199
those were examples

299
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,440
you see better in the next slides what

300
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,800
we have done so far so next

301
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
so you see the table of content as i

302
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,880
said

303
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,120
it has been stable since version zero

304
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,000
two

305
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
um

306
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,240
the let's say the list of the topics is

307
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,959
what you see they are what we touched in

308
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
version zero four and zero five is

309
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,160
highlighted there so version zero four

310
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,240
in light blue and

311
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,199
version zero five in yellow and as i

312
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,759
said basically it was to introduce some

313
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,799
slide modifications or just touch the

314
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,480
base text

315
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,679
more in the next slide

316
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,559
so basically i'm not going to give you

317
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,799
the full list of details across the

318
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,880
table but just to highlight the main

319
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,799
changes you see version zero four was

320
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,199
about introducing an update on the

321
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,319
numbers of ipv6 adoption and you know

322
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,799
users whatever it was in section

323
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,960
two and three

324
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,120
and then as far as version zero four is

325
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,919
concerned also we touched also section

326
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:36,880
five

327
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,480
so we added more references and section

328
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,919
7.3 we basically reviewed the test about

329
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,799
the

330
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,520
operations of ipv6

331
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,760
for version 0.5 we introduced changes in

332
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,799
section 3.3.6

333
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,039
so basically it was about you know to

334
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,240
expand

335
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,200
the

336
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,760
behavior of api ball

337
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,480
we also touched other sections for

338
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,320
example section 4 4.1 for those two just

339
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,480
to explain better

340
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,320
um and thanks for the comment we

341
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,120
received that um

342
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
introducing ipv6 in the overlay is a

343
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,480
matter of having let's say two steps or

344
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
two phases

345
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,240
we

346
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,679
named them

347
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,200
we named them

348
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,520
ipv6 introduction

349
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
and let's say

350
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,960
full transition to ipv6 pv6 only

351
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,679
basically those phases are not to be

352
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,520
considered as a sequence clearly an

353
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,799
operator can jump on one of the two

354
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,320
according to the airplanes so clearly

355
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,440
from a

356
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
deployment perspective you can have the

357
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,799
first phase

358
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,960
but just to be say the preparation for

359
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,679
the second one an operator can also

360
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,200
decide to jump directly to ipv6 only

361
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,600
and if i'm not wrong yes then we also

362
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
corrected some

363
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
terms in

364
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640
one of the last sections of the paper so

365
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,600
7.4 top one so basically that is the

366
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,280
situation right now so if you move

367
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,639
to the next slide list

368
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,640
as i said the uh the draft has received

369
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,480
a few comments but overall the content

370
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
the table of content is stable enough so

371
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,320
we like to ask for the

372
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
group last call so the adoption of the

373
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,440
draft

374
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,520
in any cases any comments any questions

375
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,840
are more than welcome and this is it

376
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,000
thank you

377
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,480
okay let's throw this open to speakers

378
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,960
of the mic

379
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,200
there's no one at the mics in the room

380
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,080
fred

381
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,240
if you agree i think we can cue this up

382
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,400
for working group last call

383
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,840
but

384
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,360
sounds good to me

385
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,280
yeah before we do that we will set up an

386
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
issue tracker so we can track what goes

387
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,000
on in the last call

388
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,559
so

389
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,799
the last call should start in

390
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,320
you know seven ten days something like

391
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,080
that

392
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,639
sounds good

393
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,159
so paulo uh i think

394
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,320
you're done should we move to the next

395
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,679
speaker

396
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,159
thank you

397
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,200
okay

398
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,440
so

399
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,520
so martin

400
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,559
so

401
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,640
can i proceed or

402
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
yeah go ahead

403
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,080
i will be speaking about uh detection of

404
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
nuts foreign through uh the srv records

405
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,320
uh uh please next slide

406
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,600
so why um

407
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,760
there are several solutions right now

408
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,240
to solve the issue

409
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,520
there is a rfc 7050

410
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,600
you

411
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,760
uh this uses a dns uh well-known name uh

412
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,919
and has been updated uh by rc 8880

413
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,679
there's also uh 72 25 which uses support

414
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,080
control protocol

415
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,799
there's also dhcp v6 option and array

416
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,679
option and xlips

417
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,559
but

418
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,240
these

419
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,320
solutions do have some uh

420
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
issues connected with them

421
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,280
uh the 70 50 is pretty uh hard to

422
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,360
implement right

423
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,919
it's easy to do uh wrong and it's easy

424
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,600
to use even

425
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,520
if it's implemented wrong

426
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,840
but in this case it's not

427
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,480
quite secure

428
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,360
it doesn't work with the dns six

429
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,760
dns providers other than

430
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,799
the one

431
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,640
of the isp

432
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,039
it has been updated by 888 to use

433
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,679
only the one

434
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,080
dns from auto configuration

435
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,918
but it can also be modified

436
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,840
7225 is largely ignored uh

437
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,720
same

438
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
also for the hcp option which is ignored

439
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,000
by android because of dhcp

440
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,360
and there's array option but there's

441
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,400
not

442
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,559
i haven't seen implementation in routers

443
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,760
so far

444
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,600
and

445
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,639
concerning the

446
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,039
the time

447
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,280
in which rotors are replaced

448
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,320
then we won't see it

449
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,080
for some time in some networks

450
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,760
the later three solutions are not quite

451
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,559
usable for a usb application not typical

452
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,880
one because they usually don't speak

453
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,320
either port control protocol ecp or ra

454
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,840
and there might be also issues with

455
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,039
monetary access control

456
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,120
so the rc 7050 uh requires uh to be

457
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,840
secure uh dns signs records uh

458
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,799
corresponding ptr these are obvious

459
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,600
and uh then there's a

460
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,799
requirement of secure channel between a

461
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,200
node and the receiver which is not

462
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,640
always the case

463
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,279
there's also the trusted domain list

464
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,159
needed but there is no written how this

465
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,159
list should be populated

466
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,240
and there is only mentioned that there

467
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
should be no user input so user count

468
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,400
actually says that this domain is

469
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
trusted

470
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,919
then there are uh

471
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,279
three other requirements from 8880

472
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,799
subrosal

473
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,880
must distinguish between configuration

474
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
of dns because it has to use auto

475
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,239
configuration only

476
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,600
and

477
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,679
the recursive

478
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,279
dns resolver is interface-specific

479
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,080
these are problematic at least uh what i

480
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,080
have seen in linux uh

481
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,960
there the resolve conf doesn't include

482
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,400
uh the source of the configuration of

483
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,360
this

484
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,640
information

485
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,279
so uh this rfc 70 50 when you had to

486
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,840
follow all the prerequisite requirements

487
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,840
it's quite hard to to implement and i

488
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,440
uh one implementation i have seen on

489
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,559
linux

490
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,080
then uh

491
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,279
it just uses the well-known name and the

492
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,440
ask for what well-known name and they

493
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,919
checked the vtr record and nothing more

494
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,000
and it didn't follow all the

495
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,520
requirements next time

496
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,400
so how do i think

497
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
this should be approached next slide

498
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,720
please

499
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,400
so i have put several goals of

500
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,679
which the method should use

501
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,279
follow to

502
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,400
be usable

503
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,080
first of all i think that there should

504
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,360
be no protocol

505
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,600
alteration or new protocol introduced

506
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,840
it should use only white super widely

507
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,720
supported protocols

508
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
like the application already knows how

509
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,760
to talk

510
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,159
uh it does information already provided

511
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,600
so uh

512
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,520
the note can uh know what uh information

513
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
should

514
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,240
know what information

515
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,840
the

516
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,799
uh

517
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,919
no

518
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,120
so it can uh just

519
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,080
use

520
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,240
the information it already has

521
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,520
must work with foreign dns

522
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,120
so

523
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,919
no matter what operator of dns would be

524
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,200
used it should be also work with it

525
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,559
no synthesis on the hose so no other

526
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,679
things that are not already introduced

527
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,159
into node

528
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:48,960
and

529
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
must work with the

530
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,480
no provisioning so when user brings its

531
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
own device there should be no exchange

532
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,640
of certificates and so on

533
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,120
and uh must provide detection over

534
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,360
insecure channel and must run in the

535
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,000
user space so every application in the

536
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,200
host can

537
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,679
use utilize this method just like this

538
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,158
okay so

539
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,880
what are the results uh in the draft

540
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,360
there is a

541
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,399
the srv records are there established uh

542
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,799
the application should uh be the

543
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,240
application

544
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,720
already knows how to talk to dns

545
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,240
or at least every application should be

546
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,200
able to

547
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,520
uh a node nodes

548
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,320
is ip address so it can have a ptr

549
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,360
record

550
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,799
the information

551
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,720
must be

552
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,520
presented in global dns 3 so every dns

553
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,880
provider can

554
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,600
serve this information

555
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,080
dns sec should be used to provide

556
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,320
authenticity

557
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,000
so i think the srv records are good uh

558
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,159
in place to place such information

559
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,080
because they are structured they do have

560
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,559
priorities ways and they do have a time

561
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,320
to live so

562
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,080
they can be updated theoretically

563
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,279
and

564
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,919
you know it uh can be uh

565
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,799
up to host specific level so for every

566
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,200
ptr there could should be could be a

567
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,159
different srv record and different uh

568
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,880
not six four gateways

569
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,440
so how the srv record should look like

570
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,679
at least from my perspective uh there

571
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,159
are two proposed srv records one for not

572
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,720
six four and one for dns six four

573
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,840
it it can be for uh

574
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,960
host

575
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,320
fully qualified domain name or the

576
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,360
domain itself

577
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,960
it utilizes the priorities and weights

578
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,480
only

579
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,760
the port number

580
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,919
can be utilized to transmit other

581
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,279
information but it's not uh mandatory uh

582
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,320
to to use it in this way

583
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
the srv record would then point to what

584
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,840
they record which

585
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,399
would contain the information about the

586
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,399
the prefix used

587
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,840
also that should could be also a dns-64

588
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,440
record to transfer information about dns

589
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,840
6-4 service next slide please

590
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,159
so what are in the news from the

591
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,240
previous version of the house next slide

592
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,080
please

593
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,120
so there is uh

594
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,640
version zero one

595
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,559
daniel has been just detailed some

596
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,480
process of the local domain detection

597
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,559
from the ptr records there's also

598
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,120
updates uh from the previously wrongly

599
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
uh submitted draft on

600
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,760
it 104

601
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,960
and

602
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,120
there are some changes in version zero

603
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,039
zero it's uh

604
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,520
uses a ptr record instead of dns search

605
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,640
list uh it's because the dns search list

606
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,559
is not uh transited through throughout

607
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,279
the routers and this information the ptr

608
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,120
records are

609
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,080
so

610
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,200
because of this uh

611
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
the

612
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,679
node

613
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,760
which knows its ip address can utilize

614
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,720
the ptr record and with the dynamic ptr

615
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,279
record it's possible to transmit the

616
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,799
local domain to the node

617
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,480
there are also specified now some

618
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,000
interaction with other methods and

619
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,520
forces for x slot uh the trans uh

620
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,960
there's also mentioned that any

621
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,840
transport method can be used so not just

622
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,679
the plane dns doh dot anything actually

623
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,600
there's a also specified how the

624
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,760
negative answer should be

625
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,360
should be counted

626
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,480
and

627
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,360
what

628
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,960
the node should do

629
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,200
with the time to live

630
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,760
there's also mentioned there can be also

631
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,000
the multicast support and there's a

632
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,640
proof of concept code on github

633
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,279
repository connected with the draft

634
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,760
and uh the last changes i was spelling

635
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,799
in grammar

636
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,880
so next slide please and this should be

637
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,240
the last one

638
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,000
so thank you for attention and here's

639
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,799
the github repository with the proof of

640
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,480
concept code

641
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,120
but be aware that i'm not programmers of

642
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,559
the code

643
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,960
i'm not saying the code is

644
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,760
safe to use

645
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,480
and while people are working up to the

646
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,720
mic there is chatter in the iesg room

647
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,039
that people do have to wear mics sorry

648
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,480
mosques including presenters and

649
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,480
and benno's michaels sorry

650
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,039
jen's on the roof line so okay

651
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,720
people can see the queue i'll let the

652
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,279
chairs do stuff

653
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,600
so jordy

654
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,640
hi um i think

655
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,799
some uh questions about the document uh

656
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,399
and the presentation

657
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,440
just clarifications i am not opposing to

658
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,960
the document at all

659
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,200
just uh making sure that some some

660
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,360
things are correct the first one is that

661
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,240
uh rfc 7225

662
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,120
is actually being used by some isps so

663
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,880
it should not be ignored

664
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,760
uh

665
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,440
i am not sure that rfc

666
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,720
8115 can be used for nat 64. uh i'd

667
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,640
never seen that i never tried myself

668
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,600
um

669
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,840
the other question is that

670
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,880
most of the cpes that i see

671
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,399
and even operating systems like like

672
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,679
ios or or android when they are ready

673
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,360
for using uh 964 or 464x lat

674
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,159
they have already pre-configured the

675
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,480
well-known prefix okay

676
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,840
at the other point i have is dns 64

677
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,360
synthesis is actually a good thing for

678
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,480
being done in the host so i am not sure

679
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,279
how we should recommend not doing that

680
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,360
if that's the intention of of the

681
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,200
document or or it was a confusion in

682
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,720
your presentation

683
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,240
uh there is

684
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,200
yeah yeah uh no i'm not uh recommending

685
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,720
to uh not to do uh the dns64 uh

686
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,399
synthesis on the host but i think uh the

687
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,279
method should allow uh those hosts which

688
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,240
don't do the synthesis to also work with

689
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,360
this method

690
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,840
okay clear then uh there is another

691
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,000
problem is that you mentioned about some

692
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,600
operators uh that the host know the ptr

693
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,399
they hit his address because the ptr

694
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,480
this is not actually actually true in

695
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,399
many cases because some operators do not

696
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,159
configure ptrs

697
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,399
for enterprises

698
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,720
i mean enterprise connections even

699
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,000
unless asa specifically regarded uh and

700
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,560
even less for residential users i i know

701
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,119
this is not good but it's the reality

702
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,918
and my last point is that considering

703
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,800
that

704
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,000
uh the most of the deployments

705
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,760
are using well-known prefix

706
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,119
maybe we need a document that describes

707
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,960
practical use cases for the

708
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,359
network-specific prefix

709
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,639
or otherwise uh do we really need more

710
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,199
procedures to to

711
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,119
to to to learn the nav64 i am not really

712
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,760
convinced that therefore makes sense

713
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,079
again i am not against the document but

714
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,760
i am not really convinced that it will

715
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,879
make sense thank you

716
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,079
uh so we just our act on the ptr record

717
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,680
i know that it's not the usual thing to

718
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,000
make the ptr record but there are

719
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,560
implementations that allow dynamically

720
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
generating those records so it's

721
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,680
possible to use i've also tried to

722
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,599
configure it myself it's

723
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,839
not not really a problem to to do

724
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,839
but i

725
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,440
also understand that it's not the

726
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,200
typical use thank you

727
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,359
ralph are you standing at mike

728
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,400
okay

729
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,680
so um

730
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,480
you say ptr is the entry point into the

731
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,720
secure delegation yet in the draft i i

732
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
might have read the wrong version

733
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,640
there's no example of the ptr

734
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,079
and what are you going to do with i mean

735
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,839
people in

736
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,400
non-public ip space so how

737
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,560
the how are you defining how to get the

738
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,440
actual

739
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,359
public ip space because you might be rfc

740
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,280
1980 or euler or what have you uh

741
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,079
um

742
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,920
that is not or

743
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,359
that is not routable so how are you

744
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,119
going to get the ip

745
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,680
and uh

746
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,599
sorry i i don't really understand the

747
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,640
question uh the we in add we sort of had

748
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,359
a similar problem with upgrading dns

749
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,680
servers and

750
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,400
we decided against the ptr because it

751
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,560
was a hard what jordy said to get

752
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,960
delegations in pdr and also you might

753
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,599
not have public routable ptr available

754
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,960
so you're saying that you have to have

755
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,280
public router with ptr available

756
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,040
for that to work

757
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,760
uh yeah uh you can use uh that also

758
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,359
called dynamic ptr records uh

759
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,800
if you do have it on on your uh

760
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,880
authoritative dns server uh for example

761
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,000
the node dns does have this module that

762
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,960
conf

763
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,440
that generates the those ptr records and

764
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
sign them on online

765
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,599
with the dns

766
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,280
okay and

767
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,359
um when you say

768
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,040
from the ptr again there was not an

769
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,079
example you get a domain but that domain

770
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,000
is not what you're looking for into the

771
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,119
srv record you are walking it kind of

772
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,280
label by label to get something that is

773
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,480
working

774
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,000
is it correct understanding

775
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,240
i don't know so if your pti record

776
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,760
points to

777
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,200
my myhost.example.com

778
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,359
then my host example.com

779
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,680
might not have the uh

780
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,480
srv record yeah the srv record might be

781
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,920
at example.com

782
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,680
yeah so you're you're you're you know

783
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,320
for the whole specific uh

784
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,200
uh people srv record

785
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,760
so we're a full qualified domain name

786
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,800
and then if there's no record not even a

787
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,800
dot record srv then you moved one step

788
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,599
up

789
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,839
you remove one label right yeah and and

790
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,599
the draft says you are stopping by the

791
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,320
second level domain yeah now there are

792
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,599
uh

793
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,599
third level domains that are

794
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,200
kind of actually second level women like

795
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,160
co dot uk so the drop should specific

796
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,480
maybe define more where to stop because

797
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,880
otherwise you could have a rogue actor

798
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,480
doing something bad to that

799
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,200
yeah

800
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,240
this would be if you use

801
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,040
such methods then would be good to place

802
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,240
at least the dot record or the srv so

803
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,320
the process would stop stop before

804
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,400
reaching this

805
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,599
upper domain okay

806
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,000
ted lemon apple uh so uh first of all um

807
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,920
the document uh

808
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,520
seems to be using the ptr record to

809
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,640
discover

810
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,040
the local domain but as ralph was saying

811
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,359
it doesn't actually say how that's done

812
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,720
um are you aware of rfc c6763

813
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,520
the dns service discovery

814
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,440
uh

815
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,040
not from top of my head

816
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,800
okay uh it would be worth reading that

817
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,599
because rsv6763 actually specifies how

818
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,520
to discover services using

819
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,599
the ip address

820
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,240
to look up a ptr record

821
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,000
and i think you know just referencing

822
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,680
the mechanism that it uses in fact you

823
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,200
could probably just use dns service

824
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,640
discovery directly because it's doing

825
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,920
almost exactly

826
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,440
what you describe in the document um

827
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,760
the other issue that i well i would

828
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,920
concur with the point that was raised

829
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,880
earlier that uh

830
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,040
doing validation in the

831
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,440
stub is better and so therefore

832
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,680
synthesis should also happen in the stub

833
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,480
um

834
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,280
but

835
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,200
uh

836
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,079
the um

837
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,760
sorry my brain's a little foggy from

838
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,040
being up too early uh

839
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,599
so the uh the

840
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,960
the security properties that you talk

841
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
about in the document um you haven't

842
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,040
actually justified the existence of

843
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,280
those security properties and as far as

844
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
i can tell there aren't any um the doc

845
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,880
the document doesn't actually provide

846
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,960
any additional security

847
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,880
so it would probably be worth taking

848
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,640
that out if you if you

849
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,319
aren't able to explicitly say what

850
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,720
security is provided and if you

851
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,880
want to say what security is provided

852
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,440
you should describe explicitly what

853
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,000
security you're providing because

854
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,280
as far as i can tell from reading the

855
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,040
document this is no more secure than any

856
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,119
of the other solutions i mean if you if

857
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,319
you bootstrap based on on a non-secure

858
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,480
dns lookup for example

859
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,599
essentially you're just trusting the

860
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,040
network so

861
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
it's no more secure than dhcp

862
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,599
yeah you actually uh when you do have a

863
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,280
secure delegation of a ptr uh and you uh

864
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,960
do have uh

865
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,040
and you're supposed to have

866
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,040
the address of the note uh

867
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
valid

868
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,400
and provided by some secure way

869
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,760
at least a guard or something like this

870
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,560
then you can go from that

871
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,640
and use the

872
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,000
dns sec

873
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,880
route

874
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,440
to actually validate the information

875
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,839
yeah every every step of the detection i

876
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,040
understand that but the problem with

877
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,119
that is that that assumes that you have

878
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,119
a secured delegation for the ptr record

879
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,200
and for almost every ip address that any

880
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,880
actual node is going to get

881
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,560
you can't establish a security

882
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,760
delegation because it's going to be an

883
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,920
rfc 1918 address

884
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
so for the for the vast majority of use

885
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,440
cases you don't get any security

886
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,920
now you you could for example talk about

887
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
a ce router

888
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,359
that uh

889
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,400
does

890
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,880
validation of the rfc 1918 sorry of the

891
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,440
of the ptr record

892
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,040
because that ptr record could have a

893
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,960
secured allegation because it was it's a

894
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,920
public ip address assigned by the isp

895
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,240
we hope but

896
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,680
but in the general case you can't make

897
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,319
that assumption

898
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,800
um and yeah okay so if if you have a if

899
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,040
you have an ipv6 address on the network

900
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,160
then yeah you can have a secure

901
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,240
delegation for that so so that's that's

902
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,680
sort of useful it'd also be useful to

903
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,359
connect that to vrpki validation

904
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,400
um

905
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,200
but

906
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,960
in any case uh the point is if you want

907
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,079
to have that if you want to make

908
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,280
security claims you really need to

909
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,880
document them

910
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,800
okay so i should well write there there

911
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,040
should be a secure delegation for from

912
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,520
the address

913
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,599
to the ptr zone and then also forward

914
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,720
zone

915
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,200
sorry about the rfc 1918 comet my head

916
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,720
was a little screwed up that obviously

917
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,680
wouldn't be relevant

918
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,040
jen lincoln

919
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,000
first of all i'm a bit confused

920
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,119
about

921
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,960
the differentiation between application

922
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,319
and a node you started your draft with

923
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,040
uh an application might not have access

924
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,960
to array information

925
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,760
and then your draft continues saying oh

926
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,000
this method should be used before any

927
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,800
other method as soon as address is

928
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,520
configured so and it keeps talking about

929
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,680
a node which i read as an operating

930
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,720
system

931
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,359
right so are you suggesting that

932
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,200
the host should ignore information

933
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,359
received an array

934
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,079
until this process which means sending a

935
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,640
number of dns packets is completed and

936
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,440
only then you can start using array

937
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,680
information which to be honest it looks

938
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,359
a bit confusing to me because you

939
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,520
introduced a lot of delay in configuring

940
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,680
a host and by the way some routing

941
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
vendor are implementing carry option it

942
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
will be released like i think next year

943
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,400
so you will see it in the routing render

944
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,160
configuration yeah i hope that i will

945
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,880
we will see this ra option implemented

946
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,599
soon but what i

947
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,400
can

948
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,160
see from

949
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,720
the operators are what i'm working for

950
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,680
they will not change the routers in uh

951
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,720
in a few years so

952
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,000
between the uh

953
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,839
option would be introduced into the

954
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,240
firmwares of the routers not every

955
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,319
router would have a firmware update and

956
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,319
not uh

957
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,960
everyone would be able uh to

958
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,520
to produce this r option that's why i

959
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,680
just included this

960
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,839
in the presentation that i haven't seen

961
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,839
it so far

962
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,200
but i i'm

963
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,599
i like actually the array option

964
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,800
of

965
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,880
for detection but

966
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,920
in some cases when for example

967
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,680
on linux i can't

968
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,560
see

969
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,119
the in the crd implementation that it

970
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,119
would be able to access the array option

971
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,000
that's

972
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,440
why i'm

973
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,640
proposing to do it through the dns

974
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,720
because every application inside the

975
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,119
host can actually access the dns through

976
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,119
the stub resolver okay so in this case

977
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,200
the text is even more confusing because

978
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,440
if your system or node whatever you

979
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,880
called in the draft could not even

980
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,560
access array option how can you

981
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
recommend using this method

982
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,720
and then based on

983
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,560
preference number

984
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,640
wait for another method to complete if

985
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,800
you're claiming you can't even access

986
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,440
array if you can't uh use other methods

987
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,800
then you are

988
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,480
you have to stick with the methods you

989
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,400
can access so basically i think i think

990
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,480
the draft is very confusing about how

991
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,680
it's supposed to work between

992
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,760
application and the operating system

993
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,160
especially when draft is saying doing

994
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,079
something if you don't have c lot or

995
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,440
doing something when address is

996
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,960
configured your application might not

997
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,800
even have access to that information

998
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,720
right at all

999
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,119
and by the way you say when an ip

1000
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,200
address is configured

1001
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,880
are you expecting that system will be

1002
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,440
doing for every ipv6 address configured

1003
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,720
because it might have many

1004
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,079
uh yeah it it might

1005
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,760
it

1006
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,480
if it comes from the same prefix that's

1007
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,040
there there's no point to uh to actually

1008
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,480
ask for

1009
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,359
every single ip but uh

1010
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,359
yes it should uh

1011
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,240
generally ask for

1012
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,079
ask for every id and i think the last

1013
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,200
comment i think it might work clarifying

1014
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,920
uh what to do if there is ipv4 address

1015
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,440
present because i don't think the draft

1016
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,880
even mentions that

1017
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,960
yeah you don't even know when you're

1018
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,440
supposed to use this

1019
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
okay i'll try to

1020
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,839
write it into the next version thank you

1021
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,720
thomas eckhart um so if i understand it

1022
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,160
correctly the goal is to make it easy

1023
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,319
for applications using a simple library

1024
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:39,440
on top of

1025
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,319
supposedly existing dns libraries to

1026
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,880
utilize the scheme so

1027
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,800
let me not comment

1028
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,920
more on

1029
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,400
the the feasibility of the specific

1030
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,319
choices you made but

1031
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,760
given how the long list of you know

1032
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,119
not seemingly easily adoptable options

1033
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,480
we've already built it seems to me that

1034
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,079
the one thing missing would be to

1035
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,160
also have um

1036
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
and

1037
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,280
abstract api specification about how you

1038
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,839
know application should discover and

1039
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,680
utilize the um

1040
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,119
64 mapping information

1041
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,400
so that um

1042
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,280
well

1043
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,200
we don't necessarily have to get you

1044
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,760
know hundreds of applications trying to

1045
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,480
read that draft and trying to do their

1046
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,640
own implementation and also

1047
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,040
us ending up getting a lot more freedom

1048
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,640
when we're basically saying that the

1049
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,200
ultimate specification against which

1050
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,200
applications are written is not all the

1051
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,800
details of any specific dns encoding but

1052
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,480
that that can be changed and enhanced

1053
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,240
over time without necessarily changing

1054
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,599
the api right but just being able to

1055
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,760
in an agile fashion improve on the on

1056
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,079
the on the libraries keeping the apis

1057
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,200
and then

1058
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,280
if these dns things are not secure

1059
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,280
enough or need to be improved then

1060
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,359
hopefully we could do that a lot better

1061
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,520
right so just don't think about

1062
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,800
the

1063
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,480
protocol elements that you want to do

1064
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,480
with dns but also think about what is

1065
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,119
the you know abstract api maybe go to

1066
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,359
tabs with that i'm not sure if they're

1067
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,680
more experienced in in something like

1068
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,240
this then

1069
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,720
v6 ops would be but certainly i think it

1070
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,119
would help a lot to move this forward if

1071
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,359
there was also that api aspect covered

1072
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,200
okay thank you i'm going to have to ask

1073
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,760
any further comments we're going to have

1074
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,240
a discussion on the list

1075
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,640
let's take this off the list

1076
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,520
and uh speakers in general i've asked

1077
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,119
you to uh

1078
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,160
commend yourselves to 10 or 15 minutes

1079
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,440
um

1080
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,800
we are now 48 minutes into the first

1081
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,839
hour

1082
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,760
um it's really quite a bit

1083
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,200
um

1084
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,119
i believe we need to move to the next

1085
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,839
presentation

1086
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,839
so okay

1087
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,640
so gabor i believe it's your turn

1088
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,839
hello can you hear me

1089
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,760
i hope that everybody can hear me

1090
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,000
so maybe kapoor can actually share his

1091
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,559
slides directly so

1092
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,359
that might work better

1093
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,520
is that the plan

1094
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,960
it's good for me if you share my slide

1095
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,839
share

1096
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,480
my own app

1097
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,079
maybe yeah maybe let me

1098
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,760
with your slide

1099
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,720
let me go go back here okay so i can see

1100
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
your slides and i hope that you can hear

1101
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,960
me so

1102
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,480
my draft is about the measurement result

1103
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,559
about the scalability of ip version 6

1104
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,559
generation technologies for ipv version

1105
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,800
4 service could you go to the next

1106
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,119
please

1107
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,680
thank you

1108
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,559
so

1109
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,200
in the last version uh i had some let's

1110
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,559
say warm-up results about iptvs but now

1111
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,040
they are real uh ip version six

1112
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,960
transition technology results so it's a

1113
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,599
result of dual facebook and 86 for

1114
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,000
implementation it was recommended at the

1115
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,319
last iedf meeting and it was an open

1116
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,319
source uh any d64 implementation

1117
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,200
and

1118
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,440
as last time i again did two kind of

1119
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,400
tests

1120
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,559
uh calibrate agents the number of cpu

1121
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,880
cores and there'll be scalability the

1122
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,880
number of concurrent sessions so the

1123
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,960
method is this guide in our draft which

1124
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,240
was uh uh presented already twice at

1125
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,800
bmwg working group and the session

1126
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,640
shared like target

1127
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,079
uh so the the problem is that if you use

1128
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,599
let's say facebook l864 you cannot send

1129
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,000
traffic from the uh version four to

1130
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,680
version six uh direction just the random

1131
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,839
port numbers would be required by

1132
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,319
rsd4814

1133
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,640
but first you need to send traffic from

1134
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,960
the version 6 to version 4 direction you

1135
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,359
must observe the

1136
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,359
ipad that's important recommendations

1137
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,760
and you you you should rule you reuse

1138
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,800
some valid uh portal could you go to the

1139
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,599
next slide please

1140
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,680
thank you

1141
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,960
so and the script is number of cpu cores

1142
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,359
were done with 2 1 2 4 8 and 16 cpu

1143
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,000
cores and we measured

1144
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,160
the maximum connection establishment 8

1145
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,559
which is a new thing for state school

1146
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,280
technologies and the throughput which is

1147
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,359
the normalized group would uh

1148
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,319
recommended by let's say rfd254 but of

1149
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,520
course uh we use a methodology of uh rsd

1150
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,559
82 and 19 for iq version signature

1151
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,640
technology and here is the description

1152
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,640
of the hardware used for the test you

1153
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,640
can jump it over and put your results

1154
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,598
for next type d

1155
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,200
thank you so here are the results

1156
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,800
unfortunately you cannot see my my mouse

1157
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,680
pointing but uh in the first

1158
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,240
row you can see the number of cpu ports

1159
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,440
and the second third and fourth line you

1160
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,359
can see the media and minimum maximum

1161
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,480
values of

1162
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
connection establishment rate

1163
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,040
so as you can see uh from one to two

1164
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,000
chords it is increased let's say for

1165
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,240
uh 220 to 350

1166
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,079
kilo

1167
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,559
connections per second so it's quite

1168
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,319
okay and that's not linear but quite

1169
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,720
okay and even with full port it's

1170
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,359
significantly higher so it's not linear

1171
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,640
but quite okay however uh for eight on

1172
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,280
16 cores it doesn't scale up well so

1173
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,880
unlike uh

1174
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,680
last time we i showed the results of ip

1175
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,559
tables which showed about

1176
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,880
more than 10 times performance at 16

1177
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,440
cores compared to single core now it's

1178
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,640
about less than uh let's say four ports

1179
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,960
with fixing cores so it's

1180
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,280
really bad scale up and

1181
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,440
also you you can see a throughput is

1182
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,319
very similar it gives up somewhat up to

1183
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,400
four cores but after that it doesn't get

1184
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,440
up bad

1185
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,800
we've got the next slide please

1186
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,240
thank you

1187
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,200
and

1188
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,720
the scalability agents the number of

1189
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,839
concurrent sessions it means that if you

1190
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,839
increase the number of sessions and how

1191
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,119
it will behave

1192
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,960
so i increased

1193
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,160
the port number range

1194
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,680
both the source force and destination

1195
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,880
for cambridge was usually doubled

1196
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,839
and

1197
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,000
this time i couldn't do any tuning like

1198
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,680
with ip

1199
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,000
last time so i measured three kinds of

1200
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,079
quantity maximum connection

1201
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,240
establishment rate and screw put and

1202
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,839
there was some new which is the

1203
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,240
connection t's down rate which has

1204
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,960
different has been defined uh

1205
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,160
lately and uh on wednesday i will talk

1206
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,880
about this methodology but uh i will

1207
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,200
shortly uh mention this one too could

1208
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,680
you go to uh

1209
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,240
next time

1210
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,200
thank you

1211
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,520
so here you can see that

1212
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,880
in the no no no just okay thank you so

1213
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,319
for the first line you can see the

1214
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,000
number of connections

1215
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,200
coming starting from 1.5 million and

1216
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,160
then 6 million and 25 million and 100

1217
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,240
million 400 million and up to

1218
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,359
1.6 billion so you see the number of

1219
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,839
source ports were always doubled except

1220
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,400
the last case when i couldn't double the

1221
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,839
source port

1222
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,400
but increase four times the destination

1223
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,640
point and you can see here the

1224
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,880
connections per second median and the

1225
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,359
support medium values you can see that

1226
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:26,079
they are spam degradation but not so bad

1227
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,599
but they are standard

1228
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,599
so with the number of connections the

1229
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,079
performance somehow degraded

1230
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,640
concerning both connections per second

1231
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,200
and this throughput value could you go

1232
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,160
to the next slide please

1233
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,280
just something new uh

1234
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,040
the connection here downright

1235
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,000
unfortunately we have no better method

1236
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,160
than an aggregate measurement that we

1237
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,559
load a given number of connections into

1238
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,400
the connection tracking table

1239
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,640
using the first phase of the test and

1240
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,319
then delete the entire connection

1241
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,680
tracking table and of course we perform

1242
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,520
the measurements with different

1243
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,480
kind of

1244
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,839
number of

1245
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,240
state states or connections in that

1246
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,319
connection tracking table

1247
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,760
so i did some for the refinement that i

1248
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,599
also subtracted the decision type empty

1249
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:18,720
table

1250
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,078
could you go to the next slide please

1251
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,920
thank you so here you can see the

1252
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,760
results

1253
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,160
the first three lines are the same as

1254
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,440
before

1255
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,799
so

1256
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,680
you can see that

1257
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,839
yes thank you

1258
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,200
so you can see that we use the

1259
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,799
number of connections

1260
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,599
and you can see that

1261
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,319
the duration time of the pool table in

1262
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,280
the number four roll number four was

1263
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,920
increasing it's about four times

1264
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,200
increased

1265
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,640
and if i

1266
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,960
subtracted the duration time of the

1267
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,400
empty table

1268
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,359
then it

1269
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,720
was it was always 0.46

1270
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,920
a second

1271
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,400
it made some better regards and you can

1272
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,520
see that the production dilation rate is

1273
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,760
nearly constant

1274
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,000
with any number of connections in the

1275
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,839
construction labor could you go to the

1276
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,640
next slide please

1277
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:25,440
thank you so this is iptvs

1278
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,040
i retroactively

1279
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,880
performed the connection team around the

1280
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,680
great mathematics i could evolve and

1281
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,160
it was funny that if tables produced a

1282
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,319
very high throughput and also very high

1283
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,240
financial establishment rate because in

1284
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,520
the order of

1285
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,559
millions

1286
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,720
per second and its connection here down

1287
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,440
rate is quite low so it's just

1288
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,119
in the order of

1289
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,599
400 or 300

1290
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,319
kilo connections per second it's really

1291
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,000
low

1292
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
please go to the last slide

1293
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,799
thank you

1294
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:03,520
so

1295
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,000
i have a few questions if you like

1296
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,520
the idea of

1297
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,000
how i measure the connection in our rate

1298
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,040
and

1299
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,520
just more general questions if you feel

1300
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,319
that

1301
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,599
these are these measurements are

1302
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,640
satisfactory for you and if if these

1303
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,000
results are interesting for the

1304
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,200
operators and potentially if this draft

1305
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,960
will be adopted thank you

1306
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,000
okay thank you um

1307
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,280
it looks like we'll need to take

1308
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,480
comments with the list um and and and

1309
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,400
again you know this will this will all

1310
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,520
be discussed uh we will have the weekly

1311
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,359
discussion periods

1312
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,640
uh and part of that of course will be

1313
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,599
if you

1314
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,079
feel that we should adopt the draft then

1315
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,000
um

1316
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
you need to say so

1317
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,760
um okay so mr shu i believe your neck

1318
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,160
and pardon me if i mispronounced your

1319
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,399
name

1320
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,680
yes

1321
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,599
good morning everybody i'm going to talk

1322
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,400
about the empty deployment uf

1323
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,839
next slide please

1324
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,079
so first i would like to remind

1325
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,040
everybody what this job is about

1326
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,160
so

1327
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,520
indeed

1328
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,520
never discovery

1329
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,480
rely on multi-cars extensively

1330
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,559
and indeed also trust other hosts

1331
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,680
so depending on the l2 media for example

1332
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,799
if it's on a wireless media if you use

1333
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,119
multicast it may you might you may

1334
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,640
consume a lot of energy and also

1335
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,240
multi-cars may not be as reliable

1336
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,400
the other issue is that if you trust

1337
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,640
other hosts adding the

1338
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,880
enterprise environment may be okay but

1339
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,440
in a public access environment there may

1340
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,000
be issues so as a result

1341
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,640
over the time there are more than 20

1342
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,200
rfcs documenting the various nd issues

1343
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,559
and the solutions and the solutions

1344
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,799
so first of all

1345
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,960
it's not easy to

1346
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,280
to understand all the issues and

1347
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,880
solutions so in our draft we

1348
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,920
summarize all these excels and solutions

1349
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,599
into a single place so it makes it much

1350
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,720
easier to reference because nd is a very

1351
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,400
important practical you know it's a

1352
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,880
critical part of the first half so this

1353
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,799
makes things a little easier

1354
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,880
and another thing is that we

1355
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,440
we clearly clarify that uh host

1356
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,920
isolation meaning like putting all the

1357
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,079
holes you know uh isolated from others

1358
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,480
is very effective in preventing some of

1359
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,079
the energy

1360
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,000
exceeds preventing some of the

1361
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,720
anti-issues we also provide a guideline

1362
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,799
say where to

1363
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,119
isolate holes and

1364
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,440
when not to isolate holes for example if

1365
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,240
you need for example multi-class dns

1366
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,720
then then you don't want to isolate the

1367
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,960
hose because they will break the cervix

1368
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,240
isolation

1369
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,400
and the overall result is that we

1370
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,680
believe that

1371
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,079
this will you know when you applying

1372
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,799
these uh guidelines

1373
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,200
you can simplify the

1374
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,119
first hop deployment

1375
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,359
next slightly

1376
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:41,920
so

1377
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,400
i would like to talk about one of the

1378
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,359
key contributions of this draft

1379
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:49,599
is that as we said

1380
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,480
you know if multicast or you know you

1381
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,400
cannot trust other hosts

1382
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,640
then you know if you isolate the host

1383
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,640
then obviously if there's only a single

1384
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,960
host then the multicast exceed will go

1385
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,359
away you don't have the choices you have

1386
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,200
other holes because other holes are

1387
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,720
separated into you know different subnet

1388
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,160
so this idea first came from

1389
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,319
rfc 8273 and it's called a

1390
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,920
unique prefix

1391
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,960
hose

1392
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,520
but when

1393
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,400
8273 was before it's published as an rfc

1394
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,839
there's actually a long debate

1395
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,480
in the here

1396
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,160
in

1397
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,039
whether you know uh it's a it's a good

1398
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,160
idea to publish it as an rfc and some of

1399
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,359
the concerns is pressed including well

1400
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,520
there are certain corner cases

1401
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,599
because ifc

1402
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,599
8273

1403
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,920
it

1404
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,200
basically proposed this subnet isolation

1405
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,400
and it

1406
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,559
automatically assumed that you know the

1407
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,680
holes are also isolated in l2 but you

1408
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,359
know there are certain corner cases for

1409
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,640
example if you have a multimedia access

1410
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,160
this may not be

1411
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:06,960
true

1412
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,280
so there are certain corner cases and

1413
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,160
although there are some

1414
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,400
opposition that oh you know if you do

1415
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,799
this approach then the router becomes

1416
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,039
stateful and some other

1417
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,960
use too many projects because you're

1418
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,920
basically giving each host a prefix

1419
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,960
so in our draft we basically we

1420
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,520
explicitly propose that

1421
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,640
we can buy the subnet isolation which is

1422
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,720
this unique graphics perform

1423
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,240
also with

1424
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,119
l2 isolation to make sure that you know

1425
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:43,440
in layer 2 they are really also isolated

1426
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,680
when you you know kind of like constrain

1427
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:50,000
the application scenario of ifc 8273

1428
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,880
then you know you avoid the corner cases

1429
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,559
this is the first one

1430
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,000
um in

1431
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,039
you know regarding the stateful router

1432
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,400
we believe that

1433
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,640
it's a good price to pay

1434
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,440
because when you do this isolation then

1435
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,599
you know you the holes

1436
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,440
you don't need to you know

1437
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,400
put the mechanism in the whole

1438
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,960
to avoid this problem for example

1439
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,359
alternatively for example the wind the

1440
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,960
wireless

1441
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,559
nd

1442
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,520
rfc 6775

1443
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,000
they propose some changes to the horse

1444
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,160
which we believe that you know is more

1445
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,599
complicated

1446
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,000
so we believe that this like you know uh

1447
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,039
by constraining rfc you know a2273 we

1448
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,200
believe that this is a good tradeoff

1449
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,920
and in terms of like requiring too many

1450
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,119
politics

1451
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,200
we believe that it's not a problem

1452
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,039
because nowadays

1453
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,880
most operators can get a slash 29

1454
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,480
almost without justification you know

1455
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,359
everybody can get us less 29

1456
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:59,200
and as less 29 contains you know 32

1457
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,000
billion that's 64. so it's it's more

1458
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,079
than enough um

1459
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,839
really the

1460
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:08,799
the the scenario where we are where we

1461
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,200
have the most number of codes for

1462
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,680
example in mobile broadband we are

1463
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,400
already giving you know each each host

1464
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,480
meaning the the mobile phone slash 64

1465
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,440
anyway so really you know this is we

1466
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,480
believe that use too many profits is not

1467
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,240
an issue actually you know this takes

1468
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,359
advantage of the plaintiff address of

1469
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:34,960
ipv6 to simplify the deployment

1470
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,200
so we basically we is basically

1471
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,240
discussed

1472
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,160
this idea you know

1473
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,319
this whole isolation where it's booked

1474
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,319
to be applied

1475
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,240
we identify that you know if it's a

1476
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,319
public access network

1477
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,640
so you know you may not be able to trust

1478
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,400
other hosts think you know host

1479
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,760
isolation is

1480
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,160
is a good idea or in a while it's

1481
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,559
especially low power environment

1482
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,200
where you know multi cars can consume a

1483
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,920
lot of power unnecessarily

1484
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,680
and also you know may not be that

1485
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,640
reliable so in this kind of scenario it

1486
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,920
can be you know a good idea to apply

1487
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,920
this whole isolation but again you know

1488
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,720
if you need multicast dns or your

1489
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,000
environment is very safe and it's wired

1490
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,520
you know you don't have the issue we

1491
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,680
talked about then you don't need to

1492
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,240
to apply this post isolation

1493
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,000
so we believe that you know this is

1494
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,720
actually some useful consideration for

1495
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,480
the deployer

1496
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,280
next likely

1497
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,760
so

1498
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,920
in this last slide we basically

1499
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,440
summarize some of the changes from the

1500
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,559
previous ietf so

1501
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,280
last time

1502
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,319
dave taylor eric cline

1503
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,079
they read some comments i think the

1504
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,640
first comment is about the multi-link

1505
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,920
subnet

1506
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,400
so in this version we

1507
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,200
clearly will add a paragraph to address

1508
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,920
the concern of this multi-linked

1509
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,039
subnet

1510
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,760
and then the other uh change is like

1511
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,960
last time

1512
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,559
yangrinkova

1513
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,319
talked about well if you do host

1514
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,400
isolation you may use many more

1515
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,280
interfaces which is true so you know in

1516
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,319
this version we add you know we address

1517
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,559
these you know the impact of many

1518
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:25,839
interfaces

1519
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:29,359
but generally speaking this is a

1520
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:33,038
in a public access um

1521
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,960
wireless environment

1522
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,799
we believe that you know

1523
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:37,839
the

1524
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,119
router

1525
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,079
the routers today can this provides a

1526
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,119
number of interfaces so it shouldn't be

1527
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,200
too big a problem uh either and then

1528
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,440
some miners increase profit

1529
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,359
so again we believe that this is a

1530
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,839
useful document for the community to

1531
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:58,720
consider my presentation

1532
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,720
a couple of minutes for

1533
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,400
comments with mike

1534
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,280
hi jared moch uh

1535
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,039
normally i would say akamai but in this

1536
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,719
case i'm going to put on my i actually

1537
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,279
own a fiber to the home isp

1538
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:20,560
so

1539
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,560
in this case i've just started to enable

1540
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,679
v6 for my end subscribers

1541
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,479
would in this deployment case would i

1542
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,799
now need to allocate a lot more v6 space

1543
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,520
to them because in their home network

1544
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,080
they would need to allocate a slash 64

1545
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:36,839
per

1546
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:40,080
device uh from our perspective i think

1547
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,439
that as less 64 is already enough but we

1548
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,120
certainly know that there are some

1549
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,080
operators allocated for example uh

1550
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,439
56 or even a 48

1551
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,679
i think my short answer to your question

1552
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,120
is if not from our job's perspective all

1553
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,559
we care is that each whole

1554
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:02,719
uh

1555
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,279
its own project these projects can be

1556
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,080
six people can be you know can be longer

1557
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,479
or shorter you know so so our girls

1558
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,640
perspective we don't really care i think

1559
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,040
but you you probably care i think like

1560
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,600
uh you know the the how long or how

1561
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,080
short the project

1562
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,479
i think that depends on your own

1563
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:24,000
yeah i mean i'm specifically thinking

1564
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,679
about the embedded devices where the

1565
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,359
user doesn't have a lot of interaction

1566
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,279
with them so you take something like a

1567
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,600
printer and a phone which might suddenly

1568
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,719
find themselves on a different ip subnet

1569
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:35,920
from each other

1570
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,839
uh and the

1571
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,759
the end user is not going to be able to

1572
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,319
print anymore potentially which is

1573
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,839
that's that's the type of thing that in

1574
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,920
some cases that they actually phone the

1575
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,359
isp for

1576
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,359
yeah

1577
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:54,719
so we believe that in a home network

1578
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,480
so yeah i mean this this definitely

1579
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,239
concerns me here

1580
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,159
if this is something that we were to

1581
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,840
move forward with no

1582
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,719
let me let me clarify that we are saying

1583
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:08,159
that you know you give each home

1584
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:10,960
a prefix i think that in this case when

1585
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,320
we say the host we actually mean the cpe

1586
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,560
we said that you know you give this cpe

1587
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,960
and two different cpe on different

1588
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,520
projects but what we are not saying is

1589
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,440
that inside your home

1590
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,880
you also put it really into computer

1591
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,360
into a different subnet

1592
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,440
again you know what we are proposing

1593
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,480
here is that this host isolation it has

1594
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,760
a certain scenario it's suitable for

1595
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,159
and it has a certain scenario it's not

1596
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,719
suitable for so if you are talking about

1597
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,960
the holes inside your home

1598
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,960
we're clearly saying our journey you

1599
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,880
know this is not a scenario

1600
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,320
okay i guess on the next one eric link

1601
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,120
yeah please

1602
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,560
go ahead

1603
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,320
so indeed this

1604
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,960
solution fix a couple of problems

1605
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,920
i just wonder if i understood correctly

1606
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,880
all

1607
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,199
duplicate address detection works in

1608
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,800
this case

1609
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,560
because two nodes doesn't see each other

1610
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,040
anymore

1611
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,840
alex sorry can you repeat your question

1612
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:24,800
again

1613
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,679
so

1614
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:28,800
in this situation where two nodes are no

1615
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,120
more layer two adjacent

1616
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,640
do not see each other

1617
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,120
all can node a

1618
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,080
make

1619
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,800
a duplicate address detection at that

1620
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,560
for the address that may be used by

1621
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,640
another node in the same

1622
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,920
layer 2.

1623
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,920
well okay so if i understand your

1624
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,719
question correctly you are asking well

1625
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,800
there are two holes they now they are

1626
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,960
already separated in different subnet

1627
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,840
and also separated in different l2 and

1628
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,320
if they have duplicate address you know

1629
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,120
is it okay our answer is it's okay

1630
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,800
because it's not only

1631
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,800
in difference of that it's also in

1632
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,239
different links

1633
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,920
so you know if the address is

1634
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,560
duplicating it's okay

1635
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,159
okay thank you thank you

1636
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,520
hey learn something um what do you mean

1637
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,960
there if their address is duplicated

1638
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,880
it's okay if a packet comes from the

1639
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,560
internet which one of the two gets it

1640
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,199
no ecmp no definitely not use the np

1641
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,120
okay it works

1642
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,719
the router maintain the state

1643
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,000
information

1644
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,760
so

1645
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,239
we are talking about launcher we're

1646
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,960
talking about uh link local address can

1647
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,880
be duplicated

1648
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,760
okay

1649
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,880
no we're talking about

1650
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,320
the question okay so

1651
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,440
question about

1652
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,040
one thing about the

1653
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,480
per address

1654
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,159
state on the router

1655
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,440
uh i think

1656
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,880
mostly with regard to wind right uh so

1657
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,480
the drop states that um

1658
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,640
it when uh basically

1659
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,560
uh allows uh

1660
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,199
allows uh

1661
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,920
that solves most of the problems because

1662
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,080
there's no uh there's no attacks that

1663
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,239
can be mounted but i think you should

1664
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,920
note that

1665
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,159
the hosts themselves conduct the

1666
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,000
infrastructure by applying for many ip

1667
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,600
addresses

1668
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,719
right so

1669
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,400
that's one thing right if i if i'm a

1670
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,159
host and i create

1671
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:43,840
a million ip addresses that's pretty

1672
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,280
easy for me

1673
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,600
and then the router will fall over and

1674
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,120
it run out of

1675
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,040
nd cache space right

1676
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,040
and it run and because a host has to

1677
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,560
register the address

1678
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,360
right

1679
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,880
so that's something where the host can

1680
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,800
attack the infrastructure

1681
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,840
which is not possible in in a273

1682
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,520
it's not possible in prefix per host

1683
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,560
because the

1684
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,159
the reader can just throw away all those

1685
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,760
entries it doesn't care

1686
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,080
right it just needs one mac address for

1687
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,920
the 64 and that's it

1688
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,280
so in a situation where you don't trust

1689
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,440
the host you want you really want eight

1690
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,880
two seven three you don't want anything

1691
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,840
else

1692
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,679
um

1693
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,199
i

1694
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,640
don't fully

1695
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,520
understand you because in this dual

1696
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,600
we're actually kind of like you know

1697
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,600
making it even more

1698
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,560
stricter than ap273 so if 827c3 you know

1699
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,480
if you can accept that then it's

1700
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,199
definitely you know in our we will not

1701
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:40,560
have

1702
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,719
it's stricter because the router has to

1703
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,400
keep more state

1704
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,920
in 8273 the router has to keep a 64.

1705
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,719
right but in but if you do win it has to

1706
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,239
keep the 128s no no no no

1707
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,000
here you know from the router's

1708
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,080
perspective the router's

1709
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,440
state is the same as 8273

1710
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,239
the only difference is that you know in

1711
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,719
your configuration in your configuration

1712
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,120
you make sure that you know you for

1713
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,120
example using either

1714
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,159
a private v-lang or something you make

1715
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,719
sure that the holes are not only on

1716
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:18,640
different you know with different

1717
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,880
projects but also you know isolated in

1718
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:21,920
l2

1719
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,960
so the router doesn't

1720
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,360
the draft mentions that the the host has

1721
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,880
to register the ap address with the

1722
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,640
router

1723
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,679
that's what it says in the

1724
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:36,960
[Music]

1725
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,199
only registered draft the profits not

1726
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:43,440
you know the individual not the iid part

1727
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,040
you don't have it but i just read it

1728
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,280
okay if the if um if the host doesn't

1729
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,640
need to register it's ip address with

1730
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,239
the router that's fine then

1731
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:51,840
i have an objection i'll i'll go back

1732
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,600
there

1733
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,320
okay thank you

1734
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:01,600
so we'll have more comments on the bus

1735
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,360
in a few weeks

1736
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,400
uh eric i believe or i'm sorry mr g i

1737
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,040
believe it's your turn

1738
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,320
all righty and we're gonna try doing the

1739
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,640
share this time using meat echo there

1740
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,480
lorenzo is running back

1741
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,400
wind every host must register its

1742
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,159
address at the router before using it

1743
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,199
that's what the dot says

1744
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,640
and please speak into the microphone if

1745
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,440
you reply uh okay i will i will check

1746
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,000
with you offline because again you know

1747
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,920
from my perspective the host only

1748
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,159
register so maybe the text is not clear

1749
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,719
and we will clarify

1750
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,320
all righty

1751
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,280
i

1752
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,679
i'm gonna try using the echo slide

1753
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,600
sharing so if this chairs can grant me

1754
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,800
slight sharing privileges

1755
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,679
i think so

1756
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,280
basic deployment

1757
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,199
while we're doing that could i remind

1758
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,120
everyone to speak into the microphone

1759
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,560
and not for the person you're speaking

1760
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,719
to

1761
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,360
okay mr shea are you

1762
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:31,559
yes i'm here right

1763
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,400
well when can you share your my screen

1764
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,839
my it's like

1765
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:49,199
so in the slide sharing it still only

1766
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,480
shows two of them

1767
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,880
if the chairs can once again click the

1768
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,159
allow warranty share slides button

1769
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,199
all i can see is two share slide decks

1770
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,440
in this view which are able to be shared

1771
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,879
so i will have to share my screen again

1772
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,120
clearly there are still some bits which

1773
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,599
require

1774
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,640
yes

1775
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,800
share

1776
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,199
go back

1777
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,239
stops

1778
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,000
i'm not brave enough to click present

1779
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,440
because i think that goes full screen

1780
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,320
and break sharing so okay is this the

1781
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,920
correct slide deck

1782
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,440
yes

1783
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,719
alrighty

1784
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,080
you're gonna let me know when you want

1785
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,520
to change slides and there is a few

1786
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,360
second delay

1787
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,960
thank you

1788
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,280
uh hello everyone

1789
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,800
thank you for giving me the opportunity

1790
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,840
to talk about uh requirements to

1791
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,239
multi-domain activities on the network

1792
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:17,520
uh this is the first time to present it

1793
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,960
in this ops

1794
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,520
next slide please

1795
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,040
yeah first i think some uh basic

1796
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,320
viewpoints about ipvcs only firstly fpv

1797
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,960
only is the ultimate stage of ipv6

1798
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,159
development

1799
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:33,280
uh second

1800
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,040
seminar ipv4 service should be

1801
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,480
considered seriously

1802
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,199
uh

1803
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,600
for this deployment to

1804
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,360
show to ensure the service of the uh

1805
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,239
service continuity of uh to accept the

1806
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,080
global activity for internet

1807
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:48,960
uh

1808
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,280
suddenly the deployment is ready to

1809
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,080
activate traffic ratio when fpvc usage

1810
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,600
will increase to a certain limit it

1811
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,600
would be better to consider

1812
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,440
activities only

1813
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,919
last night please

1814
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,920
yes during the last 20 20 years a series

1815
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,400
of ipvs only happen news has been a

1816
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,840
design the

1817
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,360
such as 464xl8 map e map t b knight

1818
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,679
network forward 6 for the

1819
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,239
software mesh network for backbone

1820
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,280
etc

1821
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,960
summer has been whether you use some or

1822
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,400
not

1823
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,839
okay next slide please

1824
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,080
extract

1825
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,120
network means refer to network which is

1826
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:45,199
composed of multiple autonomous systems

1827
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,679
that is yes different es mists of

1828
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:50,239
different scenarios such as metal

1829
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,639
network backbone network 4g network

1830
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,960
authority of biology map mobile call

1831
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,960
cloud be the central network

1832
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:57,840
and

1833
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,520
for for the

1834
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,480
same operator different uh as

1835
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,520
uh

1836
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,239
most likely are augmented by different

1837
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:09,360
departments or institutions and using

1838
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:13,199
different routing and security policies

1839
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,080
uh so the question here is why we talk

1840
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,920
about advances only for multi-domain

1841
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:18,880
network

1842
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,159
actually we understand

1843
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,800
issues when planning activities only in

1844
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,239
our skill network

1845
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:27,920
although there are many activities only

1846
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,080
techniques available

1847
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,960
let's not please

1848
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,000
i will give an example to show the

1849
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,239
problem the first one is partial

1850
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:43,840
division only

1851
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,360
i will use for six foot to illustrate

1852
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,920
the problem but i do not mean that it is

1853
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,840
not a good solution other country on the

1854
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,480
contrary i think it is very successful

1855
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,760
for it has been

1856
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,239
adopted by several operators

1857
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,880
or phone network which is composed of

1858
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,480
uh mobile coils and back bonus a general

1859
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,440
model for activities only is to use four

1860
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,760
six four isolating the mobile call and

1861
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,920
the peanut giveaway is known as the

1862
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,400
egress of the mobile call

1863
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,560
with this model the whole network is

1864
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,639
part of the visit only the mobile is

1865
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:21,360
ipv6 only but the backbone is used

1866
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,560
so when a package from ue go out of the

1867
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,960
mobile phone it will be transformed back

1868
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,120
to ipv4

1869
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,480
package this is not interesting

1870
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,959
next please

1871
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,520
in order to extend activities only to

1872
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,840
cover backbone network another option is

1873
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,679
to develop internet at the edge of the

1874
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:47,840
background network with this model the

1875
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,239
fpv

1876
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:54,000
from uee to the egress of the backbone

1877
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,400
but the problem is unnecessary static

1878
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,760
winding all the traffic to ipv4 networks

1879
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,760
will go through a connected way and will

1880
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,000
goes a long way wrong the data paths

1881
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,960
likely become less optimal compared with

1882
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,800
relative routing

1883
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,040
moreover

1884
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,560
session level states of the users

1885
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,880
boom

1886
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,840
next night please

1887
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,480
another possible approach

1888
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,639
uh is to deploy for

1889
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,520
464 accelerated mobile club and deploy

1890
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,560
other activities only techniques such as

1891
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,320
activity for overactivity towering in

1892
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,000
the backbone network

1893
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,400
uh we all know that ipv4 overactive stun

1894
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,199
is defined in rc5565

1895
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:44,880
where the network core is

1896
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,840
where the network core is activated only

1897
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,840
for another networks

1898
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,000
the result of this model is that

1899
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,239
multiple activities own airlines either

1900
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,440
collected by those that begin peers

1901
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,400
we can

1902
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,080
we can find that one don't we use

1903
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,040
translation values in capi oscillation

1904
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,920
so the data format in domain different

1905
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,120
domains are incompatible with each other

1906
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,239
so in this case ipv4 embedded rpvs packs

1907
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,920
need to be tracked from the back to

1908
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,440
actually four packs

1909
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,360
at the egress of the mobile coin at the

1910
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,800
peanut and then

1911
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,600
uh transfer transform to activistic in

1912
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,880
the next to me

1913
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,480
the number of conversion gateways will

1914
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,880
increase along with the numbers yes for

1915
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,960
instance we can see we can see that

1916
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,159
there are three

1917
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:35,040
uh ipv4 vc convert gateways

1918
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,040
uh obviously uh too much ipv4 at least

1919
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,120
leads to complexity of the network and

1920
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,520
the keypad is increasing

1921
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,560
therefore

1922
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,400
uh additive 6 only should spike

1923
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:52,239
i think i think it should be

1924
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,040
urgent need for marijuana is his own

1925
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,400
solution to

1926
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,480
eliminate unnecessary conversion

1927
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,719
functions and improve the date

1928
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,360
forwarding efficiency

1929
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,239
next slide please

1930
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,840
okay so here's a general uh procedure

1931
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,400
when ingrass pe received ipv4 packet

1932
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,239
from client facing interface that's

1933
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:20,560
turned towards remotely full network the

1934
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,800
ingress key must transform the ipv6

1935
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,960
package it might be the fpv for

1936
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,159
pe

1937
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:33,600
another case is that ipv4 package may be

1938
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,719
transformed into a v6 pad in ue as done

1939
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:37,520
by

1940
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,360
464 athlete

1941
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,440
before the before we reach the edge of

1942
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,520
the network in this case the ingredient

1943
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,760
pe received activist package will look

1944
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,199
up the tax destination address and

1945
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:49,199
forward the packages

1946
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:50,480
in

1947
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,639
the egress pe so the two uh model here

1948
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,440
next one please

1949
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:09,839
next slide please

1950
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:14,080
number 10 or number nine

1951
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,159
okay thank you so

1952
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,679
much

1953
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,080
network should meet following scenarios

1954
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,360
uh ipv6 user to ipv4 servers hosting

1955
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,040
cloud data centers ipv4 user to activate

1956
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:30,480
four servers ipv6 user to ipv6 servers

1957
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,440
and the

1958
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,280
dc to data center for data center

1959
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,239
communications and also provide

1960
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:39,120
service for traffic for the old network

1961
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,000
and ipvs is only epgp

1962
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,679
at peering in internet chinese pond

1963
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:49,360
and the 5g transport service sd1 etc

1964
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,480
various

1965
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,880
scenarios should be considered

1966
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,679
left side please

1967
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:04,159
so based on our experience we

1968
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,320
the following requirements should be met

1969
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,800
by maori domain activities online work

1970
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,639
the first one is that it should be

1971
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:12,800
beneficial to why the activities

1972
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,360
adoption it should not only reduce

1973
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,040
public ipv for private rights

1974
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,960
consumption and steroids of deployment

1975
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,400
ipv6

1976
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,520
the second one is ipv4 services uh it

1977
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,679
should provide activity service delivery

1978
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,679
and there should be no passive

1979
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:30,159
degradation of current parents accessing

1980
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,480
the remaining fpv4 services

1981
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,839
the third one is energy to end

1982
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,159
for any given rgb for press flow there

1983
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:41,040
should be no ipv4 fpv's conversion point

1984
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,960
in the middle of the ipv6

1985
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,880
in the past when traversing multiple

1986
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,400
domains domain

1987
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,040
network in other words ipv4 package

1988
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,360
should not appear in the middle of the

1989
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,520
activity pass the end-to-end

1990
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,600
requirements also be valid for cloud

1991
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,440
cloud communication

1992
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,840
the next one that the simultaneous

1993
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,880
support of the translation encapsulation

1994
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,920
the call

1995
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,840
the corners do not distinguish between

1996
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,920
translated base a dvd package or each

1997
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,520
constellation based path at this

1998
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,199
packaging packet

1999
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,520
at the end at the egress the pe can

2000
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,600
recover rtv fighters by reading the next

2001
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,520
title field of the packet

2002
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,280
so the translation that you have this

2003
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,760
later mode in pvc only have the same

2004
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,280
ability this address mapping algorithm

2005
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,800
the fifth requirement is controller

2006
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,320
dependent we all know that computer has

2007
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,480
been deployed by some operators to

2008
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,600
provide sd9 functions in the case of

2009
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,400
ipv6 only the output forward fpv for

2010
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,920
package to the right

2011
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,960
egress pawn fpv4 usability information

2012
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,199
must be exchanged

2013
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:46,080
between the ipv4 network over 56

2014
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,719
but this product this process should not

2015
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:50,800
be rely on the deployment of any

2016
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,840
synchronized component

2017
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,760
requirement 6 is user feelings at the

2018
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,480
bottom of the way

2019
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,719
with english power

2020
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,920
so it's not responding or management

2021
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,679
and close to user site

2022
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:10,400
it is unsuitable to store user related

2023
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,920
status at the

2024
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,400
bottom database with other networks it

2025
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,480
should be unaware of the user's reading

2026
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,239
information

2027
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:22,159
the next requirement is high scalability

2028
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:23,679
and

2029
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:26,400
it should achieve scalability simplicity

2030
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,040
high availability and um

2031
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,000
when p precise ipv4 features at the item

2032
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,920
at the edge of the network the positive

2033
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:37,040
ipv4 releases not increased linearly or

2034
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,960
exponentially along with the quality of

2035
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,239
human traffic

2036
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:42,080
it is better to adopt algorithm-based

2037
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,199
imaging

2038
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,199
approach to avoid excessive

2039
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:47,760
status queries at the eyes it should not

2040
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,600
overload the existing activities

2041
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,280
resulting table

2042
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,080
requirement 8 the srvs is applicable as

2043
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,239
services can be supported by exerting

2044
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:59,360
sih in translated activism package

2045
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,920
or increment encapsulated package so the

2046
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,920
network programming can be realized for

2047
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,800
active dv4 traffic flows

2048
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,159
the next one is

2049
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,639
the incremental deployment it should

2050
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:13,920
deploy your increment fashion and the

2051
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,920
the overall transition percentage should

2052
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,960
be stable and operational

2053
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,840
that's nice please

2054
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,960
so this is the job about the

2055
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,440
requirements it does not intend to

2056
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,719
design a new transition mechanisms

2057
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,400
compared with two years ago the

2058
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,880
situation of the network has changed a

2059
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,560
lot especially due to the rapid

2060
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:42,400
development of 5g and cloud computing so

2061
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,639
we should examine activities from new

2062
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,040
perspective for this draft more work

2063
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,199
needs to be done we are

2064
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:50,800
looking we are looking forward to

2065
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,199
receiving more comments and suggestions

2066
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:56,560
we also hope it can be adopted

2067
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,800
in the future

2068
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,120
question for you uh are you planning uh

2069
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,600
in one of your slides you mentioned that

2070
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,639
uh

2071
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:15,040
you need a framework for how to handle

2072
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,560
multi-domain

2073
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,760
uh the ipp fixed deployment

2074
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,040
um

2075
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,360
are you planning to propose such a

2076
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,760
framework

2077
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,040
uh

2078
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,280
yes well

2079
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,639
so

2080
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:33,520
actually we want to uh hear the feedback

2081
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,639
from vixx's ops first then based on the

2082
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,719
feedback comments and

2083
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:42,000
then we maybe consider to uh

2084
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,920
provide a framework or something like

2085
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,159
that

2086
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,239
framework

2087
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:57,600
sorry

2088
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,600
it would be good to see a proposed

2089
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,800
framework

2090
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,639
okay okay

2091
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:06,000
so from the uh from standpoint of

2092
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,760
operator from china telecom we hope

2093
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,120
there should be a framework to

2094
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:14,159
give the guideline of ipv6

2095
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:18,239
only deployment in our skill network

2096
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,000
actually we have done some 12 uh in some

2097
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,860
field trials during last one year

2098
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:32,800
[Music]

2099
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,040
to tell the

2100
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,519
result

2101
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,800
some cases future

2102
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,480
well this is between you and turneth

2103
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,239
well do you have anyone in the queue

2104
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,960
we don't have

2105
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,800
we don't have

2106
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,440
dear derek

2107
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:06,440
eric

2108
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,639
oh okay okay i'm sorry that's the next

2109
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:13,040
uh presentation so going back to the

2110
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,719
last presentation

2111
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:17,280
um why don't we cue this up for a week's

2112
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,480
discussion

2113
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,280
um i'll make sure that the issues are uh

2114
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,960
tracked in the

2115
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,080
tracker

2116
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,679
and um

2117
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,440
during that time we'll ask the author if

2118
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:31,719
he wants this to be a call for adoption

2119
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:40,000
that sound good

2120
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,120
can you hear me friend

2121
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,760
uh

2122
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,719
yes i can hear you i i i thought i said

2123
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:56,960
that worked for me man

2124
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,280
okay

2125
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,639
okay eric

2126
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,800
okay thank you

2127
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,840
so that's about a presentation about a

2128
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,159
measurement about ipv6 essential headers

2129
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:11,840
over the internet

2130
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,360
and the first things i hope that you

2131
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,159
like the acronym that we used

2132
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:17,280
james

2133
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,000
kind of a fun one at least so my name is

2134
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,880
eric wink i am supervising basically a

2135
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,960
student in the master computer science

2136
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,480
which is raphael

2137
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,600
and

2138
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,800
another supervisor guy is justna which

2139
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,280
is a phd students also at the university

2140
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,199
of the ash so the next slide if you

2141
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:37,678
don't mind

2142
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,520
so

2143
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,800
thanks to jan fernando and tim right

2144
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,800
there is this rfc 7872

2145
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,040
they did something similar

2146
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:51,840
but it's six years ago which means

2147
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,600
centuries ago

2148
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,159
when we see the deployment of ipv6

2149
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,239
so we need to do something else

2150
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:00,480
and we did it as well

2151
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,080
not only more recently right it's

2152
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,320
basically a couple of weeks ago

2153
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,960
but also using a different kind of

2154
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,560
methodology

2155
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,920
right we don't use the same system

2156
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,360
and no need to say in this room that

2157
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,400
the suitability of extension headers

2158
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,719
over the internet is important if you

2159
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:22,400
look about the six-month working group

2160
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,480
and we've got only in the room we know

2161
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,840
that many drafts are talking about from

2162
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,080
there up

2163
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,320
and it's not only of biops

2164
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,480
they are other accentuators

2165
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,600
as well as new ip protocols that has

2166
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,960
been recently

2167
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,239
defined

2168
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:41,239
next

2169
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,480
oh we do it

2170
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,960
we are renting about a dozen

2171
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,920
of vms worldwide

2172
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,320
and we send traffic among all of them to

2173
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,639
make a full mesh

2174
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:59,679
you see obviously in the map

2175
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,040
they are glaring black spots

2176
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:06,400
we were unable to find a vm provider

2177
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,560
in africa which is ipv6 enabled

2178
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,400
we try as well to get one in china but

2179
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,080
it was a little bit more complex but

2180
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,840
this one we get good hope

2181
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,719
as

2182
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:19,440
we've got bruno zeres thank you fernando

2183
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,760
if you are listening to me

2184
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,520
we got one in slovenia thank you

2185
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,080
yan and one in the land thank you stefan

2186
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,000
i sent thank you sander on this one and

2187
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,400
we got also bangalore and others

2188
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,719
next

2189
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:38,800
so how we do

2190
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,639
it's not only about sending packets and

2191
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:42,239
receiving weather and checking whether

2192
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,239
we are receiving it we are also sending

2193
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:46,159
them like a trace route with a different

2194
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:49,360
hub i hope to see where the drop happens

2195
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,320
okay

2196
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,800
and we do it in both direction and it's

2197
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,360
from vantage point to vantage point we

2198
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,960
do not re rely on a reply from the

2199
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,480
destination

2200
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,040
we simply run tcp dump on the other side

2201
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,560
to see whether the packet has come

2202
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,679
through

2203
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:07,600
okay and we basically use

2204
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,760
scappy to send them

2205
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,320
this is all the tests we are doing

2206
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,800
we are always including a udp and tcp

2207
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:19,040
payload so our packets looks normal

2208
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:22,639
using hub by op and decision option

2209
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,800
with different size

2210
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,400
of the option inside the decision header

2211
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,400
right we should have tried every number

2212
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:34,400
but basically use all powers of two we

2213
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,560
also use all the routing other times

2214
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,280
from the zero which has been obsoleted

2215
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,920
up to six and just to please run right

2216
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,760
on this one

2217
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,239
i mean anyway we want to check it

2218
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:48,560
so fragmentation

2219
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,560
both atomic fragments so

2220
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,719
when there is only one fragment

2221
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,520
um in in the fragments i would say and

2222
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,080
non-atomic so where we have the first

2223
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,159
fragment offset zeros with but with the

2224
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:02,480
more bits on

2225
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,119
we use as well authentication editor

2226
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:07,520
marksman says hey we should try as well

2227
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,800
esp that's for the next one

2228
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,119
and then two kind of new

2229
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:16,800
ip protocols right the no next header

2230
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,040
which is defined in 8200

2231
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,040
and one which is defined in network

2232
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,880
programming which is the ethernet

2233
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,199
payload and we just want to check what

2234
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:28,080
they're going through

2235
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,760
all those packets

2236
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,159
always as a payload

2237
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:34,800
in this payload i am using the students

2238
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:35,760
actually

2239
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,080
encoding the mechanism used

2240
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,119
in

2241
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:41,520
specified in the draft that i have in

2242
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,560
upsec

2243
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,719
on this one which is basically inserting

2244
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:49,040
either in the dns or

2245
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,760
in the the payload a pointer to a

2246
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,239
document describing the experiment

2247
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:57,280
right in multiple languages required

2248
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,400
and then the weak part is that we try to

2249
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:03,679
assign the drop responsibility to some

2250
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:05,920
specific as

2251
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:09,360
not always easy things about isp

2252
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,280
things about two p

2253
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,199
p e to p link

2254
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:14,880
of course they use the address of one of

2255
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,199
their as and not each of one right so

2256
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:18,960
that's not always easy

2257
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,000
okay

2258
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,480
next one

2259
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:23,760
so

2260
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,760
we send multiple of probes multiple

2261
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,239
times different hop limits basically to

2262
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:30,239
be sure that we try to get really really

2263
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:33,678
the right one next

2264
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,760
but the most important is not so much

2265
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,040
about which as is dropping

2266
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:44,159
is more about the result themselves

2267
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:45,520
so

2268
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,800
the only case where hope biop was

2269
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,400
behaving

2270
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,320
like specified

2271
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,520
is when we were using a unknown option

2272
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,440
with the bit discard if you don't know

2273
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,080
it

2274
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,920
because in this case

2275
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,800
100 of the packets were discarded

2276
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,520
which is expected behavior

2277
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,679
they're the one a few of them were going

2278
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:09,600
through

2279
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,760
destination option

2280
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,040
this one is more interesting

2281
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,520
if you use addition option which is only

2282
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,800
eight

2283
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,719
bytes long

2284
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:23,040
it's basically go through they com in

2285
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,960
all the 13 meshed

2286
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,280
thing they were always traversing the

2287
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:30,320
internet without any drops

2288
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,760
which is good

2289
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,960
as soon as you go to 16 that's still

2290
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,239
good you move to 32

2291
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:40,400
you're only 93 percent of the packets

2292
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,840
are going through

2293
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,800
and so on it's getting worse and worse

2294
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,719
if you do the math

2295
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:49,679
40 bytes of a pv6 header

2296
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:52,560
plus 16 56

2297
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,520
this is less than 64.

2298
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:58,639
if you do it 40 32

2299
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:00,719
the first one we get this year drop

2300
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:04,800
is 72 which is larger than 64. so we can

2301
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,239
mostly yes

2302
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:09,040
no proof no not a fact right my only

2303
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,679
educated guess is that some routers have

2304
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:15,040
got a look right of 64 bytes

2305
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,600
and if there is larger they drop it

2306
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:18,560
because

2307
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,840
maybe they are

2308
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,239
applying a layer 4 access control list

2309
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:24,159
on the transit traffic and they don't

2310
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:26,400
know so they drop

2311
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,679
okay anyway that's a fact right so

2312
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:31,600
routing headers

2313
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,600
as expected rotating in the type zero

2314
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,520
which has been obsoleted

2315
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,320
has dropped about 90 percent of the

2316
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,400
traffic is dropped and 81 is going

2317
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,159
through

2318
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:43,760
interestingly enough

2319
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,280
for

2320
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:48,239
segment routing

2321
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,000
segment routing is used only in a

2322
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,600
limited domain

2323
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,119
and if you look about all the draft and

2324
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:55,679
the rfc they say traffic

2325
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:58,239
having this code 0.4

2326
01:41:58,239 --> 01:42:00,000
arriving in my domain if you are using

2327
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,119
segment routing you should drop it

2328
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:05,600
so obviously in this case a couple of

2329
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,239
providers were using internally segment

2330
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:10,560
routing and were dropping packets coming

2331
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,840
from the outside with it so it kind of

2332
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:16,639
works and all the rest one two three

2333
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:19,040
and ron you'll be pleased that your cr8

2334
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,880
5 and 6 are going through

2335
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,159
as expected so it is perfect

2336
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:25,760
atomic fragments

2337
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,560
they are heavily dropped right 30

2338
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,000
percent of the drop happens there

2339
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,920
but normally atomic fragments are no

2340
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,320
more used right so that's kind of okay

2341
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,400
if you're using normal fragmentation we

2342
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,840
see no drop

2343
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,440
so which is good

2344
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,440
and like i said authentication header

2345
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,719
that's fine no next editor that's fine

2346
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,159
100 transmission ethernet payload

2347
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:52,719
that's fine as well

2348
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:53,520
so

2349
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,560
that's the only result

2350
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,239
we try

2351
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:01,199
using some heuristic to find which as is

2352
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:02,880
doing what

2353
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,440
and we were having about six or seven t1

2354
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,480
in there

2355
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,040
so that was important and no wonder most

2356
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:11,360
of the tier one do not drop

2357
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,440
there's more like some

2358
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,480
access

2359
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,400
isp that drop it

2360
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,840
so

2361
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,520
wait and see on this more details will

2362
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,040
be coming because

2363
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,560
currently the heuristic that we are

2364
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,239
applying

2365
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:26,400
i mean i'm not that confident in them so

2366
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,920
we are trying to get something much more

2367
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,679
accurate for dropping and there are

2368
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:31,199
well-known papers from caidah and

2369
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:32,719
address on this

2370
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:35,280
next slide

2371
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:41,760
we also have an operator survey

2372
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,600
so for the operators in the room you can

2373
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:47,119
forward the email it's in the slide it's

2374
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,600
so click on it that's a lot of questions

2375
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:53,119
we simply want to know whether you are

2376
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:56,719
playing some specific policies based on

2377
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:58,960
extension headers

2378
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,560
of course again it would be a sampling

2379
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,040
so nothing really scientific but always

2380
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,159
said

2381
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:08,080
if you know about a vm provider or you

2382
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:11,920
are happy to host a vm running linux and

2383
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,600
python and scrappy

2384
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,880
on your rpv6 site in africa please let

2385
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,159
me know

2386
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:19,920
okay while we are here can even pay you

2387
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,880
a bill glass of wine on this

2388
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,560
and then the other one is maybe redo

2389
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,360
something like jan fernando and tim did

2390
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,440
not only sending traffic between the

2391
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,199
vantage point

2392
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:33,679
but also sending traffic to alexa 1000

2393
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:36,480
or some bgp prefix and see what has

2394
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,639
changed compared to six years ago

2395
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,239
that's the next step

2396
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:42,400
so stay tuned for philadelphia we should

2397
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:43,920
have more results there

2398
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,280
and as i said

2399
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,440
we really need to get more information

2400
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,639
about the s

2401
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:50,159
so there are some techniques used by

2402
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,719
notably about kaida and others

2403
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:55,840
to do it and that's the next step

2404
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,400
and the last slide before going to bq of

2405
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,440
questions

2406
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,119
which looks like

2407
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:03,119
v6 extraction that the chain with so

2408
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:05,840
many excession there's one to the other

2409
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,440
that's the git up

2410
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,719
uh for under the code right

2411
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,080
master student quality code right so but

2412
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,199
it works

2413
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:16,400
okay

2414
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,440
i see some questions

2415
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:27,360
i actually see quite a few questions uh

2416
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,960
but i'm afraid we're going to have to

2417
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:32,000
take this list

2418
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:38,480
are we

2419
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,000
doing any here are we going straight to

2420
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,920
the list for questions

2421
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:46,159
let's go straight to the list um

2422
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:52,440
for the people here i'm here right so

2423
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:02,080
uh ron i think you're next

2424
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,320
hello

2425
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,840
hello can you hear me

2426
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,799
okay

2427
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,400
okay

2428
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,040
um we wanted to outline the procedures

2429
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:30,080
uh for this working group we had um some

2430
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,239
discussion about what the role of a

2431
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:34,400
chair is when something can proceed when

2432
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,400
it can't so we just wanted to take some

2433
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:41,638
of the ambiguity out of it next slide

2434
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,239
the steps to publication you're all very

2435
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:46,719
familiar with post an internet draft

2436
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:48,480
that's mandatory discuss it on the

2437
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,440
mailing list that's mandatory presented

2438
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,360
at a meeting that's optional have a

2439
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,600
working group we call for adoption and a

2440
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,920
working group last call both mandatory

2441
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,400
next slide

2442
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,480
posting an internet draft

2443
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,880
the file name should be draft your name

2444
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,600
v6 ops and your topic

2445
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,920
uh post a message to the v6 ops mailing

2446
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,480
list inviting review

2447
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,480
and the chairs will determine whether

2448
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,719
the draft is in charter

2449
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:20,639
and our charter can be found at this

2450
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:22,480
website

2451
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,400
so this is a chair function to determine

2452
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:28,239
whether it's in charter next slide

2453
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:32,239
okay

2454
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:33,920
now the next thing you're going to want

2455
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,119
is

2456
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:37,840
some time on the agenda to

2457
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,199
present your draft

2458
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:41,360
what are the pre-requirements well you

2459
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,440
must have a new or updated in charter

2460
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:46,159
draft and you must have at least some

2461
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:49,520
discussion on the mailing list

2462
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,920
meeting time allocation rules

2463
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:54,159
uh drafts that have been adopted by the

2464
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,639
working group get time first

2465
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:59,679
uh individual submissions next

2466
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:02,159
chairs may deny a request for meeting

2467
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:03,199
time

2468
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:04,960
if the re three requirements haven't

2469
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,880
been satisfied

2470
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,360
if there's no time on the agenda

2471
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,920
or if the draft has previously failed to

2472
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:14,719
call for adoption

2473
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:18,560
now this last bullet is important um

2474
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,600
if you're asking for a call for adoption

2475
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,760
uh you probably want to uh

2476
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,520
have some review on the mailing list

2477
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,280
early clean up some of the issues that

2478
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,480
came up

2479
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,719
um

2480
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,719
because then you you know you must get

2481
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:34,639
your uh

2482
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:37,840
uh request shares may not uh deny a

2483
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,400
request for any other reason

2484
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:43,600
that's to say i can't say um

2485
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,360
you know you've requested agenda time

2486
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:47,360
you've met all the pre-requirements i

2487
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:48,800
don't like the draft so i'm not going to

2488
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,239
give you uh

2489
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:53,600
time on the agenda no i can't do that

2490
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,960
as a chair

2491
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:57,440
next slide

2492
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,040
calls for adoption

2493
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,440
again three requirements are the same uh

2494
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,159
a new or updated in charter draft some

2495
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,400
mailing list discussion

2496
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,800
chairs may deny a request

2497
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,480
if the pre-requirements haven't been

2498
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,080
satisfied

2499
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:16,400
or if the draft has previously

2500
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,480
failed to call for adoption

2501
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,719
chairs must not deny a request for any

2502
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,560
other reason

2503
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,080
when the chairs issue a call for

2504
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,119
adoption

2505
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:27,679
they also begin to track issues with the

2506
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:30,480
data tracker

2507
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,199
i'm sorry no yeah they begin to track

2508
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:36,000
issues uh in a transparent way so we

2509
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,159
know what's outstanding

2510
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:41,400
next slide

2511
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:47,679
now the chairs judge consensus to adopt

2512
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:49,119
um

2513
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:50,159
if

2514
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:50,960
they

2515
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,719
they adopt if the working group agrees

2516
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:54,800
they want to address the problem

2517
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,760
if they agree the approach is reasonable

2518
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,560
and if all blocking issues

2519
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,440
in the tracker have been addressed

2520
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:05,360
uh

2521
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:08,000
to be adopted you only need to be good

2522
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,920
enough to be a starting point you don't

2523
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,719
need to be good enough to publish

2524
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:14,880
and in the discussion on a call for

2525
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,080
adoption

2526
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,920
would appreciate it if you posted

2527
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,080
technical issues only

2528
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,320
uh plus one support or opposition

2529
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:23,920
doesn't count

2530
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:26,320
those kind of messages

2531
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,760
you know won't make the way into the

2532
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:28,960
tracker and

2533
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,679
won't have much of that

2534
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:33,440
um

2535
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,840
chairs must recuse themselves from

2536
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,520
consensus calls

2537
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,159
on drafts that they have co-authored so

2538
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:42,000
if i co-author a draft in this working

2539
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,560
group i must recuse myself from the

2540
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,400
consensus call

2541
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,638
next slide

2542
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:55,599
working group less call

2543
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:57,440
all of the issues in the tracker must be

2544
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,440
addressed

2545
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,920
the chairs may deny a request

2546
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,520
if the free requirements haven't been

2547
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,040
satisfied

2548
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,520
and chairs must not deny a request for a

2549
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:10,159
last call for any other reason

2550
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:12,638
next slide

2551
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:15,760
last slide

2552
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,800
that was the last line okay so this

2553
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,480
should be

2554
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,080
um

2555
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:22,880
just

2556
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:25,679
you know rules for fair play i don't

2557
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,239
think it'll be very controversial but i

2558
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:31,959
see folks at the microphone

2559
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,119
the toilet

2560
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:44,960
so

2561
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:46,639
ron and freddie this is shipping here

2562
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:49,119
from huawei and i'd like to

2563
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:51,679
make a suggestion first of all i

2564
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:53,520
i want to say that you know i fully

2565
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,320
support this procedure

2566
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,880
but these procedures seem to me you know

2567
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:02,320
from every life it start with a joint

2568
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,679
so i think this is a good procedure

2569
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:08,719
for managing the job submitting to the

2570
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:11,440
working group i agree with that

2571
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:13,360
but i think that in our charter there's

2572
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,280
also a statement say that you know the

2573
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:18,159
six of long tools basic input from the

2574
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:20,880
operators and users

2575
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:24,000
and if we insist that you know well if

2576
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,239
you want to provide input you must have

2577
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:27,440
a duet

2578
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:29,360
then i think like this can be

2579
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:31,119
limiting to us

2580
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:33,920
so here i want to propose that it makes

2581
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:34,960
sense

2582
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,599
for the meeting presentation i'm only

2583
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:39,760
talking about the meeting presentation

2584
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,599
for example in the future

2585
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:44,800
can we always have two

2586
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,920
sessions

2587
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:48,080
in each iepf

2588
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:51,440
so we we add another session

2589
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,599
and then we invite you know

2590
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:56,480
some other for example either operators

2591
01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:01,199
or users or even ipv6 deniers

2592
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:03,760
who talk about why you know what kind of

2593
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,679
challenge they see because for example

2594
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:09,119
recently there's this big debate in nano

2595
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:12,560
right about the the use or not use of

2596
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,119
240's last fall

2597
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:16,639
a lot of people

2598
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:18,960
making leagues are saying that oh you

2599
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,239
know

2600
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:22,159
that you know i6 you know there are so

2601
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:23,840
many challenges

2602
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,840
um

2603
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,880
you know if you stop these skills you'll

2604
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,719
spend half the time the you know

2605
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:36,880
patching ipv4 on ipv6 ipv6

2606
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:39,599
but we are not really acknowledging that

2607
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:42,159
you know the the sharing they see

2608
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:44,880
so i wonder if it makes sense for

2609
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,239
example to

2610
01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:49,040
to add one more session in each ietf

2611
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:50,800
because there are a lot of interest on

2612
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:53,520
ipv6 there are a lot of challenges and

2613
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:57,360
this way we can bring more input

2614
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,280
you know kind of like identify the

2615
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:02,800
challenges more so that we can ietf can

2616
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:06,159
can solve them better thank you

2617
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,920
i think that you have a good point here

2618
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:12,239
there because we're an operational group

2619
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:13,679
we're a little different than the rest

2620
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:15,599
of the ietf

2621
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:17,760
and maybe it would make sense for us to

2622
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:20,639
have some kind of joint session

2623
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:23,920
between all of the nogs and um this

2624
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,599
working group

2625
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:28,560
would that work for you

2626
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:32,719
yes yes thank you because i think that

2627
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:34,639
some of these challenges for example

2628
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:38,960
various ipv6 consoles or you know ipv64

2629
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,960
or maybe none of them also talking about

2630
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:44,000
it but my feeling is like v6 up will

2631
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,880
probably you know have more talent i

2632
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,719
think like this maybe the

2633
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:52,239
better places than than other places and

2634
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:55,040
i think like for example if if people

2635
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,599
talk about their challenges here some of

2636
01:54:57,599 --> 01:54:59,840
us may document their challenges and

2637
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:00,960
eventually

2638
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,440
us publish the job rather than those

2639
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,199
guys because of the operator guys they

2640
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:07,440
may not have the time but if you know we

2641
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,840
like them speaking this ipv6 council

2642
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,719
that ipv6 council or nano then maybe the

2643
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:14,800
issue will be mixed and then in the end

2644
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,840
nobody kind of like document all these

2645
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:19,119
challenges and put it into a single

2646
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:21,679
place like people can probably reference

2647
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:22,560
thank you

2648
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,719
okay let's exchange some emails on the

2649
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:27,440
list about the logistics of this you

2650
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:28,800
know whether it would be an interim

2651
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:29,840
meeting

2652
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:33,280
um what not would be invented uh invited

2653
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,280
um what other organizations but this is

2654
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,840
a good idea

2655
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:41,040
warren

2656
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,599
thank you warren kumari google

2657
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:45,840
so i don't know i mean i i like this

2658
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,119
general idea

2659
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:49,599
i don't know if we definitely need a sec

2660
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:51,599
separate session each time

2661
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:53,280
i think what it should be is what many

2662
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,520
working groups do where they use the

2663
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,000
first part of the agenda for

2664
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,719
adopted work etc and then if there is

2665
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:02,800
any time left over we use it for new

2666
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:03,679
work

2667
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:05,440
i mean for some meetings we might have

2668
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:08,159
two and a half hour sessions and only 15

2669
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:09,760
minutes or 20 minutes of working group

2670
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,760
business and it seems silly to have a

2671
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,080
separate session just for new work if

2672
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:15,679
we're not using all the time

2673
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:17,440
but yeah i mean to me it seems like a

2674
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:19,520
reasonable idea to have

2675
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,520
some set of the meeting time put aside

2676
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:22,320
for

2677
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:25,280
you know new science project ideas or

2678
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,679
presentations on other stuff

2679
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:30,239
and v6 ops was doing something kind of

2680
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:32,000
similar where it would do invited

2681
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,560
presentations from like operators on

2682
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:36,239
what they found from deployment or

2683
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:37,440
similar

2684
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:39,599
so i think the procedures are good in

2685
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:41,199
general but i think there should also be

2686
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:42,800
some time for

2687
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:45,119
you know discussing new work or floating

2688
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:46,719
ideas

2689
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:50,639
okay that was with no hats clearly

2690
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,880
actually i'm kind of envious of that

2691
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:57,760
it goes well with the math very cool

2692
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:59,679
jared

2693
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:01,760
and the badge yeah forget the ietf

2694
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:04,800
protocol for this badge

2695
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:06,480
so there

2696
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,480
so there's one other thing which is sort

2697
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,599
of a well-known secret but not a secret

2698
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:14,080
ietf which is the iepg meeting which was

2699
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:15,199
yesterday

2700
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:17,360
where the uh

2701
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:18,880
you know where a number of operator

2702
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,800
network operators actually do show up

2703
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,040
and talk about issues

2704
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,960
as well and so

2705
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:26,400
it's sort of this interesting thing

2706
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,000
because actually a lot of people even in

2707
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,719
the ietf leadership and you know the iab

2708
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:33,599
and isg don't really know what it is

2709
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:36,639
uh and so it's it's something where

2710
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:38,960
i think there's an opportunity to also

2711
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,440
leverage that uh because for example at

2712
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:42,880
least one of the presentations that was

2713
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:45,040
here today was also there yesterday but

2714
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:47,119
there was opportunity to have a bit more

2715
01:57:47,119 --> 01:57:49,360
of a conversation dialogue based on the

2716
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:51,520
uh the agenda time that was available so

2717
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:53,679
i think that that's another opportunity

2718
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:56,239
and venue outside of these direct

2719
01:57:56,239 --> 01:57:58,480
working group activities as well

2720
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:02,320
uh to go and socialize things

2721
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,519
thanks

2722
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,760
let's let's bring discussion of the

2723
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,840
logistics of this um

2724
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,599
to the mailing list i think we all agree

2725
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:13,920
it's a good idea the only question is

2726
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,480
who and how

2727
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:22,400
and with that i'll give it back to fred

2728
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:26,800
well

2729
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:31,119
uh so can you hear me um

2730
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:34,400
medieca was asking me if i'm talking and

2731
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:35,599
i'm talking

2732
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:39,520
so i don't understand we can hear you

2733
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:43,119
okay so um

2734
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:46,560
with that we're at well within two

2735
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,800
minutes at the top of the hour

2736
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:51,040

2737
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:53,040
