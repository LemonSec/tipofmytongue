1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,720
oh

2
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,080
uh

3
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,520
um

4
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,320
okay

5
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
if i could uh could have your guys

6
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,920
attention

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,720
guys and gals i don't mean i mean guys

8
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,600
is

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,960
being to everyone

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
but maybe i'll work on that

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,720
um so uh welcome to the uh the hackathon

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,159
it's uh

13
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
it's great to be here um

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
so i guess i should say yeah welcome

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
back to the hackathon

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,360
as you know we've been having the

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,600
hackathon you know for a number of years

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,680
and then we did it online

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
and uh i think it actually worked you

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
know uh better than i thought it would

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,880
work out with us being totally online

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,840
um certainly better than nothing but um

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
but i'm really excited that we have the

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,159
opportunity to be back here uh for so

25
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,000
many of us we're in person some people

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,159
still remote but uh hopefully this is a

27
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,600
sign of um of things good things to come

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,920
uh i'm just curious have a few questions

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,079
uh for how many people this is actually

30
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,040
your first in-person event since covet

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,360
started

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,600
okay yeah that's a that's a pretty good

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,240
number i thought that might be the case

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,159
um another questions i usually ask for

35
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,000
how many is this your first hackathon

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
first ietf hackathon

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
that's that's a pretty good number two

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
and then the one i always find

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,160
interesting as well

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
how many this is your first time doing

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200
anything with the ietf

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
okay so most okay some of you for that

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
too well welcome to the ietf uh

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,360
[Applause]

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,440
i i i'm a bit biased but i think this is

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
a great way to get started with the ietf

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
and uh and hopefully uh you'll find that

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,800
too and

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,160
if you're not sticking around for the

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
meeting this time around that's

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,000
obviously fine but hopefully uh this

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,519
kind of inspires you to get more

53
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,640
involved in other things too

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,519
so uh just a quick reminder um why we're

55
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,760
here so whether we're online or in

56
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,720
person

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
still the goal of the hackathons we want

58
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,959
to be able to advance all the work we do

59
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,120
with itf standards

60
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,840
to uh to work to make our specs better

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,920
by by writing some code

62
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,280
uh that implements what we're

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,959
standardizing then feeding that back

64
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,480
into the specs

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,800
and just making more code available i

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
think if you saw the email from from

67
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,239
stewart too

68
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,159
having open source implementations is a

69
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,560
great way to not only improve a standard

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,959
but to make it more deployable i think

71
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,799
most of us who are here probably believe

72
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,720
that already if you have good examples

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,040
of it of course uh share those with

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
stuart

75
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,440
and then uh you know to attract uh

76
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
developers and new people into the ietf

77
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
which obviously we're doing so that's

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
another one of the big reasons why we

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
have these

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,040
so i also need to remind everyone

81
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,959
especially first-time people the the

82
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,360
ietf everything we do in the itf is

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,519
under the note well the the ietf

84
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,519
hackathon is no exception

85
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,040
hopefully you've already familiarized

86
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
yourself with the notewell

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,000
if not take a look at it these slides

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,879
are

89
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
in the data tracker you can pull them

90
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,720
down from there they're also on github

91
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
um and if you have any questions about

92
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,400
any of these we can chat about that more

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,640
but the other thing i wanted to

94
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,280
mention is that we're of course working

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,238
on code and all that code should have

96
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,478
some license associated with it

97
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
and so although we're operating under

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,840
the note well the code that you're

99
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
working on

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,199
probably has a license too and make sure

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,960
you're familiar with that

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,520
and so you'll be following um the rules

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,080
of it and the rules of how ipr works

104
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
related to that license

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,800
so uh it's good to have a look at the

106
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,720
code you're working on as well

107
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
now discussions and the presentations

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,880
that we're doing here those all

109
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,120
are itf contributions and fall under the

110
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,520
note well

111
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,240
any inclusive language just uh

112
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,520
i

113
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,880
you know something i struggle with at

114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
times too i'm sure a lot of us do think

115
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
about the words you choose but in

116
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
general just just be nice to each other

117
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,000
be welcoming to each other

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,840
you know i see that already here with

119
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
with what's gone on everyone seems very

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
welcoming and so i think we have a great

121
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,400
culture

122
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,199
but just try to keep it in mind and

123
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,520
and make it easier for us all to to work

124
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,479
together with each other

125
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,639
all right projects so last i checked we

126
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,680
had about 20 over 20 projects they're

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
all on the wiki if you haven't had a

128
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,680
chance to look through them uh suggest

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
you do that most of you seem to have

130
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,280
already found a table

131
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,720
you probably know which project you're

132
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,800
working on and that's great but feel

133
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,280
free to and i think it's great if you do

134
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,560
talk with the people working on the

135
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,639
other projects especially ones that are

136
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,560
kind of related because oftentimes

137
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
you'll find that um

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
you have expertise or interest across

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
multiple projects and the fact that

140
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,919
we're here in person makes it a little

141
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,520
bit easier to

142
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,720
uh go and switch off between groups too

143
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
so so take advantage of the fact that

144
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,400
you're here

145
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,280
if you're not sure which project to join

146
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,120
um you can also go to the lost and found

147
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,400
and uh this is both for people who need

148
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,880
people on their projects can say hey

149
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,319
these are the skill sets we're lacking

150
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,319
right now that we could really use and

151
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,080
it's for people who are like hey

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,759
these are things that i'm interested in

153
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
i'm i'm you know

154
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
i'm happy to help any project for which

155
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,240
you know that they need those skills

156
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,319
then you can put those there as well

157
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,000
and of course you can just walk around

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,720
to the tables too

159
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,199
okay so the agenda

160
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,520
uh we're already at the the kickoff as i

161
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,039
mentioned that there was some some

162
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,360
snacks and they'll be back there we'll

163
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,600
have lunch brought in so

164
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
hopefully you you can of course take off

165
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,599
whenever you want to manage your own

166
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,840
time but if you want to stay here and

167
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,720
keep working we'll have lunch brought in

168
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,400
and it'll be out there you'll be able to

169
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
bring it into the room

170
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
uh there'll also be some snacks in the

171
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,840
afternoon and then we will have dinner

172
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,039
provided

173
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,919
and so you're welcome to stay here and

174
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,360
work here all day if that works for you

175
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,400
we will close the room at nine o'clock

176
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,680
and uh

177
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
please just be mindful of that we want

178
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,759
to be able to to clear the room so the

179
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,479
hotel staff can shut it down and

180
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,800
and everyone can get to

181
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
doing other things at a reasonable time

182
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,720
and then again tomorrow the doors open

183
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
at 9 30 like they did today

184
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,960
lunch will be provided

185
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,800
now the main thing i want to point out

186
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
is that

187
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,840
we will be doing the project

188
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,800
presentations starting at 2 o'clock

189
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,520
and i encourage you to share your

190
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,720
results

191
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,039
um of what you were able to accomplish

192
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,360
and and that type of thing so think

193
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,199
about that as you're you're working

194
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,639
along here and plan your time

195
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,520
accordingly that these are very short

196
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
simple presentations for those of you

197
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,960
who have been here before but

198
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,720
um it still takes a little bit of time

199
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,240
to get them together

200
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
and we'll start it at two o'clock so

201
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
you'll want to be able to make sure that

202
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
you have your presentation ready to go

203
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,120
at that time

204
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,080
and

205
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,479
then the hackathon will regardless of

206
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,560
how many presentations we have we'll

207
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,120
make sure that we're done by uh within

208
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,879
two hours that we can stop at four

209
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,160
o'clock

210
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,759
and and that's when the hackathon will

211
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,560
end and then we have an hour to kind of

212
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,720
uh clear the room and and tear

213
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,199
everything down

214
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,720
any questions about the agenda

215
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,800
okay

216
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,360
so

217
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,080
we still have a number of people who are

218
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,560
uh remote and teams where we have people

219
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,040
who are here in person and remote we

220
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
want to be able to facilitate that

221
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
uh gather is a great tool that we've

222
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,080
been using for a couple years now to

223
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,640
help us when we we did meet online

224
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,120
and so encourage you to use it now and

225
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,399
to work with

226
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,480
um with people who may not be here in

227
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,680
the room

228
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
and uh

229
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,640
so i have a picture here of the gather

230
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
space and you can see

231
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,480
to get into the hackathon room there's a

232
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,120
little arrow here if you follow that

233
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,519
it'll take you to the hackathon space

234
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,200
and then if you go to that space you'll

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,120
find tables that look a lot like the

236
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
ones here only

237
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,080
they didn't get the nice white

238
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,720
tablecloths that we got

239
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
but you're welcome to take one of the

240
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,839
tables there

241
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,320
and use that for your team

242
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,480
and then you can meet around that that

243
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,519
table

244
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,720
you can um then and invite others who

245
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
may be remote to come join you at that

246
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,920
table

247
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
and you'll be able to have audio video

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,399
conferences within that share notes that

249
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
type of thing so hopefully this helps

250
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,120
you

251
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,200
with that interaction with remote and

252
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,320
in-person

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,360
teams

254
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
and one of the things we'd like to know

255
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
is get some feedback from you as to how

256
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
well that works

257
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
so so please do give that a try and let

258
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,079
us know if you find that useful

259
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,800
the other thing i don't know if anyone's

260
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,399
taking advantage of this this time

261
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,600
around

262
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
access

263
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,920
remotely to to the ietf network or just

264
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
for some advanced functionality if you

265
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,800
need anything kind of more layer two-ish

266
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,720
for your project is did anyone make any

267
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,560
networking requests

268
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,920
of the knock this time around

269
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,680
okay well i won't uh won't spend time on

270
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
that one then

271
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
maybe some of the remote teams

272
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,240
will be using that

273
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,480
okay i mentioned the presentations

274
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,360
so

275
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
and i think i hopefully i said these are

276
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,200
pretty short pretty simple presentations

277
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279
just just quick hitters of what it was

278
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,560
you were trying to solve with your

279
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,320
project what you achieved what you

280
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,959
achieved what you learned

281
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,560
sharing that so

282
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
the idea with these is they should be

283
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
five minutes at the very most and if

284
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,320
they're only two or three minutes that's

285
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,600
actually great

286
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
they're just to give people a general

287
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,200
idea

288
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,640
and people who aren't necessarily

289
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,880
familiar with in depth with what you

290
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,800
were doing just give them an idea of

291
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
what it was that you did

292
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
and then

293
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
if they have some interest they can

294
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,680
always come and talk with you more about

295
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,320
it so so this is just a very short kind

296
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,040
of high level presentation

297
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,519
and we'll give everyone's invited to do

298
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,360
those and i encourage you if you're here

299
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,279
at the hackathon that you do put

300
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,040
together one of these so that you can

301
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,719
share your results with with everyone

302
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,640
now when you

303
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,399
you put together your presentation

304
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,000
what we'll want to be able to do is to

305
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,640
share them on github so what i have here

306
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,519
is a link to the ietf github org

307
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,040
and within that we have a repo just for

308
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,440
this itf for itf

309
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,920
113.

310
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,360
so within that

311
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,920
um that repo if you go to it you'll find

312
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,360
a few things

313
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,399
you'll find first of all there are these

314
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,440
templates

315
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,519
and so you're welcome to download and

316
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,200
use these templates to help you put your

317
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,360
presentation together you don't have to

318
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,760
use them but many people find them find

319
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,519
it useful just

320
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,680
because it kind of gives you a format

321
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,160
and helps you or helps remind you the

322
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,560
questions that we want you to answer so

323
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,760
those are there to help you out

324
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,519
now once you have your presentation

325
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,920
you'll need to upload it into this

326
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,399
repo and in order to do that you need to

327
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,360
be a member of the ietf github org if

328
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,800
you aren't already a member from

329
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
previous hackathons you can become a

330
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
member and there's some instructions in

331
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
the readme here that show you exactly

332
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,720
how to do that

333
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
and uh so you can follow those the main

334
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,399
things are you need to make sure that

335
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,040
you associate your name with your your

336
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,720
github account hopefully that's already

337
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,000
been done but

338
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,680
it's very handy if you just have a

339
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,320
username that's a little cryptic

340
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,399
please put your real name

341
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,920
or the name that you're known by and

342
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,279
make sure that you have two-factor

343
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,279
authentication enabled just so that we

344
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,360
don't end up getting hacked

345
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,760
uh because that wouldn't be good

346
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,880
and then so you send a request to uh to

347
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,839
bury myself the hackathon shares and we

348
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,399
will get you added

349
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,920
okay this is one thing that's new that i

350
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
wanted to highlight

351
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
so the data tracker hopefully you've

352
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
been seeing we're getting all kinds of

353
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,920
new great functionality implemented in

354
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,279
the data tracker

355
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,600
and one of the cool things is being able

356
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,880
to

357
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,120
correlate a little bit better between a

358
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,760
draft or an rfc that you're working on

359
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,199
and some running codes and

360
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,360
implementation related to it

361
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,040
so there's a new tag that you can

362
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,440
associate within the data tracker

363
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,839
and you can use that it's it's called

364
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,160
related implementations

365
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,240
and so when you see the additional

366
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,920
information

367
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,399
here in the data tracker

368
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,279
if it's a personal draft of yours an

369
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,000
individual draft you'll be able to edit

370
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,519
you'll you'll get a little edit thing

371
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,160
like that and so you can put the link to

372
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,360
where you're

373
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
running code where your implementation

374
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,399
is

375
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,320
or if it's a working group draft you can

376
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
ask your working group chair to add that

377
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,639
for you or if it's an rfc again the

378
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,800
working group chair can add that for you

379
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,880
and so it's a really cool way that with

380
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,519
a given draft you can point to one or

381
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,600
more uh implementations that you

382
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,959
actually have of it

383
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,040
so i i really encourage you to do this

384
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
for the projects you're working on i

385
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,360
think it'd be a great way to help people

386
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,560
who aren't here who aren't familiar with

387
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,399
the code you're working on to realize

388
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,720
that there is code related to the draft

389
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,360
so please give that a try

390
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,040
and if you have any problems with it you

391
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,839
can come see me we can chat about it

392
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,880
okay so

393
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
uh then when

394
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,199
the hackathon ends well it's not really

395
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,720
over we still have an opportunity to

396
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,800
share what we've done a bit more

397
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,959
and so hack demo happy hour this is

398
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,480
something we haven't been able to do

399
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,959
when we've been remote now it's it's

400
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,800
back so on monday

401
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,720
this is a chance for you to really

402
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,279
discuss your project in more details i

403
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,720
mentioned how the presentations are

404
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
pretty short just kind of give people an

405
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,959
idea of if they're they want to talk

406
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,800
with you more

407
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,199
hack demo happy hour that's a great time

408
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,120
you can present you can be there you can

409
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,560
be sharing what you did with your

410
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,519
project

411
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,759
and people from the ietf community even

412
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,279
people who aren't here in the room right

413
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,000
now can come by and have a more in-depth

414
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
conversation with you we'll have some

415
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,639
snacks and a cash bar there just to make

416
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,079
it a little bit

417
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,720
easier for you to hang out and enjoy it

418
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
but the idea is that you can really have

419
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,560
those more in-depth conversations around

420
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,839
your project

421
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,040
and so that's from 5 to 6 30 on monday

422
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,199
and if you're interested in doing that

423
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,120
please make sure that you let us know so

424
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,600
we have enough space reserved

425
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
register before noon on monday

426
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,000
and if you already know you want to do

427
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
it register now you can register anytime

428
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,639
up until

429
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,480
noon

430
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,120
on monday

431
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,399
and

432
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,079
if you go to the wiki you'll see the

433
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,758
links to get to the registration page

434
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,040
then the code lounge that'll be

435
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,279
actually here in this space i forgot to

436
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,519
mention for the hack demo happy hour

437
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,000
you'll see it it's in this same space

438
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,839
we're in room one and two right now the

439
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,880
grand

440
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,440
uh klimt hall one and two is where we

441
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,480
are now

442
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,079
so part of this

443
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,560
will be dedicated to the code lounge

444
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,959
and the other part will be also used for

445
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,720
hack demo happy hour

446
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,639
so the code lounge the idea is that all

447
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,079
throughout the week you'll be able to

448
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,199
come here

449
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,120
and just sit down at a table you'll have

450
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,639
access to power and you can work on code

451
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,640
so it's not just limited to the

452
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,160
hackathon it's not like you get

453
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,760
everything done just over the course of

454
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,599
the weekend so you're welcome to come

455
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,880
here anytime

456
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,640
you'll be able to use the ietf lounge

457
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,799
but then there'll be space and power for

458
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,679
you to work on code

459
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,839
and it's just an easy way to

460
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,000
have space to come together

461
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,599
and and meet with the people on your

462
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
team

463
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,000
if you find it useful you can actually

464
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,640
schedule time to help coordinate too and

465
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,320
so there's a link there where you can do

466
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,480
that

467
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,559
and then i also want to thank uh

468
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,039
cnn nick they are our running code

469
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,320
sponsor

470
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,520
and uh again this year or for again for

471
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,400
this ietf hackathon so that really helps

472
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,960
fund uh our efforts here so that we do

473
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,919
have

474
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,160
food and coffee and space and all those

475
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
good things

476
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,520
and

477
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,880
i'm a little out of practice with

478
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,799
running this and i actually forgot and i

479
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,360
just realized that uh i wanted to invite

480
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,480
lars

481
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,240

482
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,160
to come and say a few words i'm sorry

483
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,919

um but please please come and i think

486
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,120
this is the first hackathon uh since you

487
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,559
became chair is that right where we've

488
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,919
been in person the first and first of

489
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,320
all now okay thanks so yeah i don't have

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,919
much to say i'm not secretary chair the

491
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,080
ietf i took over melissa cooper a year

so many people participating in the

495
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,760
hackathons again and i think it's gonna

496
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,520
keep going up until we're back at the

497
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
regular strength but this is already

498
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,559
much more people than i thought we were

499
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,039
gonna have so this is great um

500
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,240
to also thank the the running code

501
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,919
sponsors specifically c and nick and i

502
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,200
think cisco's also pitching in some

503
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,679
money and also the the chairs of the

504
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,039
hackathon events which is charles i

505
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,720
think barry is your co-chair right who's

506
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,240
in the back there yeah uh because they

507
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,840
do actually all the heavy lifting of

508
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,400
organizing this and um without them and

509
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,240
also the sponsors right we couldn't like

510
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,360
trick you to staying here as long as

511
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,039
possible by bringing in food and drinks

512
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,640
and that sort of stuff so so this is

513
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,360
actually well appreciated by everybody

514
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,000
um so have fun enjoy write some code

515
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
it's really nice that the itf has open

516
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,799
standards that everybody can can read

517
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,559
and implement and uh there's a sort of

518
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,880
synergy between open source and open

519
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,720
uh standards that i think the hackathon

520
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,559
has been really good at sort of teasing

521
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,720
out and and strengthening so i'm very

522
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,600
glad to see this uh growing over time so

523
