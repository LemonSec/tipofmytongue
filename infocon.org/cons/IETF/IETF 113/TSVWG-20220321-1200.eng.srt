00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,240
tracker and three decks in me taco

9
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,280
so we appeared

10
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
there's a refresh button at the top

11
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,680
and that one shows four for me after i

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,079
push to refresh

13
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,320
david do you see the slides for

14
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,280

18
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,599
yeah they're there

19
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
okay

20
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,519
on the other hand me duck always just

21
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,560
showing me

22
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
a new deck is being shared so not

23
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
getting anything out of that

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,840
hang on let's see if that's working now

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,239
no i still have problems let me go take

26
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,239
out my corporate firewall see if that

27
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,640
improves things

28
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,319
so

29
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,280
okay

30
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,320
so this will be tsvwg

31
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,880
we will wait just a couple of minutes

32
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
for people to enter the room

33
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,160
as in other sessions we'll be taking the

34
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,479
queue via me techo

35
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
so if you want to speak please join the

36
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,560
queue in me techo and we'll try and

37
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
coordinate with

38
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
remote participants as well as people in

39
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,360
the room

40
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,759
and take you in line when you

41
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,520
are here and you wish to speak at the

42
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,639
mic

43
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,160
and when it comes your turn just go

44
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,199
ahead and speak at the mic

45
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,160
we currently have

46
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,639
three of our four decks of slides loaded

47
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,520
into mateco

48
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,800
and

49
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
we will start in

50
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,639
just two minutes time we'll need a note

51
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,000
taker

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,160
as usual

53
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
so we'd love to have a volunteer of a

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,320
note taker

55
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,199
so

56
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,880
right i guess we'll start this is tsvwg

57
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
welcome to vienna

58
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
welcome if you're a remote participant

59
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
welcome to our local participants

60
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,800
the three chairs of tsvwg are

61
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,039
myself gauri fergus

62
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,360
where's eddie who's remote and david

63
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,039
black who is also remote

64
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,840
so this meeting like all the meetings

65
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,039
that the ietf holds is covered by the

66
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,039
ietf notewhile

67
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,600
if you haven't seen this please read it

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,280
if you have seen it

69
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,360
please look at it again if you have any

70
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,840
queries about ipr and what to discuss in

71
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,400
front of other people

72
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
our policy is quite simple and quite

73
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,360
clear

74
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,560
please just stick to the policy

75
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,680
we need help in tsvwg with various

76
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
things

77
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
and of course to start a

78
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,000
tsvwg meeting we need help with the

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
notetaker

80
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,199
at this point we pause and we wait for

81
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,840
somebody to volunteer as a note taker

82
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
sure it will

83
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,479
okay this

84
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,360
gets an honorable point

85
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
and um we shall work harder to find

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,520
someone else next time but thank you

87
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
ever so much stewart

88
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,319
stewart cheshire will take some notes

89
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,039
and we will

90
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,639
publish those at the end of the meeting

91
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,879
if you're going to submit future work to

92
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,879
this working group it's helpful to tell

93
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,800
the chairs in advance

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,520
it's helpful to write an internet draft

95
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,879
probably essentially if you wish to

96
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,000
present

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,120
and please add tsvwg somewhere in the

98
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
draft name so we can flag it in the id

99
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,319
in the id tracker

100
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,479
we're using the meat echo mic here

101
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
so

102
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
this is your instructions for using meat

103
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,919
echo if you haven't used it um simply

104
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,400
press the hand button and we will see

105
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,440
you in the queue here

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,599
don't use the mic icon if you're

107
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,320
actually in this room

108
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,399
if you're using the

109
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,360
qr code to log in take the blue sheets

110
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
then you won't have a mic button on your

111
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
app

112
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
and that's a note that we do need people

113
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
to use the qr code so we can

114
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
take the blue sheet record of who's in

115
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
attendance so if you haven't scanned the

116
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,839
qr code please do

117
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
we have a number of documents that were

118
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
progressing through the working group

119
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,880
and as ever document quality relies on

120
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,480
reviews

121
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,800
so if you'd like the documents that you

122
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,120
care about to be reviewed please put in

123
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,720
effort to review other documents

124
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
review comments can be anything from

125
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,839
people

126
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,240
helping to improve particular texts

127
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,920
to people raising up issues to be

128
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,600
discussed

129
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,519
a lack of reviews probably indicates a

130
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,440
lack of care

131
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,279
that the document is finally published

132
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,200
so please do review

133
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
and if you wanted something new to look

134
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
at that's coming up towards a working

135
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,560
group last call

136
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,480
there's the udp options and dscp

137
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,959
considerations work which are two things

138
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,320
which

139
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,519
probably could do with reviews soon

140
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,640
so our achievements and accomplishments

141
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,800
are we have published no rfc since

142
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,120
ietf112

143
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
which is called a be kind to our area

144
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
director period

145
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
we have a number queued up to go to our

146
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
area director

147
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
and

148
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,920
we have one id still at the rfc editor

149
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,160
which has been through review and will

150
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,399
be published shortly which is 496 obese

151
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
five ideas are with working group chairs

152
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
and authors

153
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,920
indicating to our ads that things are

154
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,000
heading their way soon

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,920
the ecnn cups um still has some text to

156
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
be refined

157
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,959
and then we'll receive a shepherd write

158
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,200
up and be sent for publication

159
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,959
we don't anticipate the need for further

160
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,720
working group input here but we will

161
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,519
send the changes proposed to the list so

162
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,760
you can confirm that the document in its

163
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,279
final state is ready for progression

164
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,560
ecn for tunnels that use shim headers

165
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,680
has already been through this process

166
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,880
but is paired with the above draft

167
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,079
then we have the three l4s ids

168
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,800
um which wes might want to say a few

169
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,800
words to if you're online wise

170
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:12,959
sure

171
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,880
so uh

172
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,600
these are all post working group last

173
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,279
call at the moment

174
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,800
uh we've solicited on the mailing list

175
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,680
for

176
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,360
everyone who

177
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,720
had commented and was expecting

178
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,040
some changes to make sure that the

179
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,079
changes match their expectations

180
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,440
and

181
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,320
we discussed at the

182
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,279
interim meeting prior

183
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,560
the

184
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,040
solicitation of inputs on the shepard

185
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
write-ups and i have a huge

186
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,760
um number of responses on those which

187
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
have been working through

188
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,440
and i think there are only a couple of

189
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,079
small points

190
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,120
left

191
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
to be

192
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,560
taken care of still

193
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,440
so i think they're very close to

194
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
being complete and

195
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,720
i plan to wrap those up with the people

196
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
i've been corresponding with uh on

197
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,600
this week and

198
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,040
get these

199
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,639
to the area director

200
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,600
uh

201
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,399
in a week or so

202
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,880
so thank you and if you have any

203
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
questions about these particular drafts

204
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,240
please um send them to the chairs

205
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,320
and where's will be shepherding the

206
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,279
process

207
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,880
as they proceed towards publication

208
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,079
and we have a number of remaining

209
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,320
working group ids

210
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,880
we have the l4s ops guidance which we'll

211
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,560
be talking about

212
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,839
nqb which we'll also be discussing

213
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,519
udp options

214
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,639
and dplp mtud for udp options three and

215
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,360
four will be taken on friday

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,519
dtls and sctp an sctp nut will be taken

217
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,200
today

218
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,040
assigning a new recommended dscp and how

219
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,880
you might go about this and what might

220
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,120
be the hurdles to getting a good dscp

221
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
will be discussed on friday

222
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,440
and multipath dccp will also be

223
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,639
discussed on friday

224
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,680
we did a milestone review

225
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
and

226
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
when we did these slides we had three

227
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,160
milestones which were from may 2002

228
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,199
two or two two and september two or two

229
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,959
two

230
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,920
and

231
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,279
milestones which were being revised for

232
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,120
mpdccp dtls

233
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,079
and the dstp considerations

234
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,160
i think they're either approved or

235
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,680
they're in the process of being approved

236
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,519
so

237
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,519
they will appear in the tracker if you

238
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,839
look

239
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,399
um

240
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,560
various other milestones were

241
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,720
reviewed we've decided as working group

242
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
chairs we're going to try and keep our

243
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,639
milestones up to date

244
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,240
working groups have to decide what

245
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
they're going to do with milestones

246
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,040
whether they think they're superfluous

247
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
or whether they think they're helpful

248
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,880
we've decided that they're useful

249
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,720
targets

250
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,240
and therefore we're going to try and

251
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,320
refresh them and keep them sensible and

252
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,040
try and hope well try our best to

253
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,480
facilitate getting the documents

254
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,680
published before the milestone is due

255
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,519
so the milestone

256
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,600
is the date at which we expect this work

257
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,279
to conclude

258
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,480
beforehand is always good

259
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
we have a number of liaisons and

260
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
announcements

261
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,720
i'm not aware of any new liaison updates

262
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,160
david do you have anything to say under

263
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,079
the air zones

264
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,040
the wba liaison was responded to about a

265
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,320
year ago

266
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,079
we basically said

267
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,880
try not to use quite so many dscps and

268
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,000
suggest that wba and 3gpp

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
get coordinated on this nothing has been

270
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
heard since i think we can take this off

271
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,240
future agendas

272
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,560
okay and similarly the liaison requests

273
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,279
on

274
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,040
dtls

275
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,399
was encouragement to produce the

276
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,040
document to submit it to

277
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
publication so that e3 gpp could

278
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,399
reference it and the gsma relays on

279
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,040
related to multi-path dccp

280
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,759
and their expectations for that

281
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,680
which we discussed previously so nothing

282
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,720
new here

283
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,600
there is a request for doing proposed

284
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
work on a new ccid

285
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,360
i'm bringing this up here just for the

286
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
point of view of coordination

287
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,320
and this is relates to the datagram

288
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,959
congestion control protocol

289
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,759
it's a proposal to add a ccid relating

290
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,279
to bbr

291
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,120
and at the moment bbr is an item of

292
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,880
discussion as an algorithm in iccrg

293
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,839
so there is nothing that the transport

294
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,160
working group here will do until the

295
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,480
algorithm has been approved for

296
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,199
progression in the ietf and when it has

297
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,680
we can come and determine whether a ccid

298
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,160
is appropriate useful and interesting

299
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
for us to progress

300
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
so if you're interested in this space go

301
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
read the draft

302
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,199
help facilitate the work and encourage

303
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,839
the publication of a bbr spec and we

304
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,720
will move forward

305
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
in addition i want to mention that the

306
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,800
hpcc plus plus draft has a

307
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,120
uh has a an agenda slot in rtg wg

308
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,399
routing working group next at next hour

309
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,320
um yeah it's got some relationship to

310
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,000
routing but

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
it probably belongs over in transport

312
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,959
and i think the suggestion is that uh

313
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,920
iccrg ought to have a look at this uh in

314
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,880
general it'd be good to think about what

315
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,959
the transport area ought to be doing in

316
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,959
the way of data center

317
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,919
congestion control

318
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
thanks david as ever

319
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,000
data center and internet and not that

320
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,240
far apart and we have to understand how

321
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,799
to do congestion control involved

322
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,959
so that's a good comment keep your eyes

323
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,199
on that

324
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
and we have our agenda

325
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,840
the agenda asks what's currently

326
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,280
put up looks like this

327
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,919
if you're aware of it today is monday

328
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,240
and we have three topics for discussion

329
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,600
today

330
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,120
relating to

331
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,918
sctp and also the l4s ops draft

332
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,600
and

333
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
we'll take comments on the agenda if we

334
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,200
have any

335
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,799
if you wish to

336
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,480
suggest amendments or corrections please

337
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,080
do

338
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,880
i'll also show the agenda for the

339
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,559
friday meeting

340
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,320
the second slot

341
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,280
for tsvwg will be on friday

342
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,879
session two we'll look at these topics

343
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
we don't currently have any other

344
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,280
business scheduled

345
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,000
and we do expect some discussion of the

346
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,240
atss

347
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
um

348
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,760
atss

349
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,080
work

350
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,799
in 3gpp which is a work item in the side

351
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,440
meeting probably following the friday

352
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,480
session i will send announcements

353
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,600
to the

354
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,880
to the list

355
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,120
with details about how to participate if

356
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,840
you're interested

357
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,640
any other agenda items or anything else

358
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
that you feel you wish to mention on the

359
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,720
chair slides then we've just

360
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,400
the first of our

361
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,360
topics for today

362
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,240
maybe the only agenda bashing will be if

363
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,720
when i go to the meet echo i don't find

364
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,640
slides for michael's item 3.1 we will

365
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,320
take michael at the end of the session

366
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
rather than the beginning because

367
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,600
that will give us time to work out how

368
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,719
we're going to get slides to you

369
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,559
we have michael's site here by magic so

370
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,320
michael you'll be

371
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
on first

372
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,840
to talk about a ctp

373
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,320
nut so this is a

374
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
item which we're encouraging discussion

375
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,400
on to figure out what the working group

376
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,600
should do

377
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,799
with a

378
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,640
id that's been around for probably one

379
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,159
of the longest

380
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,520
on our list

381
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,640
and

382
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,240
it's one that we need to determine what

383
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,640
the next steps are so michael go ahead

384
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,559
and talk and at the end we'll ask what

385
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,280
those next steps should be over to you

386
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,240
michael

387
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,799
okay thank you um

388
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,840
can you go to the next slide

389
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,000
yeah so this is this is about a draft

390
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
which has been around for a long long

391
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,480
time

392
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,480
um we had working group last call um

393
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
we got um

394
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,799
there was a transition

395
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,440
of the transport ads so we got two

396
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,159
reviews from magnus and martin

397
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,120
and

398
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
right now we have an alternate proposal

399
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,159
from ericsson which i

400
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,480
provided a link to go to the next slide

401
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
so

402
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,559
to given

403
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,039
a very high level view why we are

404
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,400
talking about sctp and net

405
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,120
it basically comes down that an an sctp

406
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,679
endpoint can have multiple ip addresses

407
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,080
but only a single port number

408
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,840
so

409
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
the partner my concept is shared between

410
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,640
udp tcp dccp

411
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,440
udp light and http but when it comes to

412
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,520
this multi-homing thing

413
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,280
it's only a single port number and that

414
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,600
has the consequence that if you have

415
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,799
multiple path towards your peer

416
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,760
if you want to change the part number it

417
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,159
has to be done

418
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,799
consistently on all the paths

419
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,320
so

420
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,360
assuming that the middle boxes are not

421
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,799
communicating to each other this means

422
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,760
you

423
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,559
can't translate the port number

424
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,919
and

425
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,039
this

426
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:51,840
has

427
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,559
then as a consequence what are you doing

428
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,400
if you have local port number collisions

429
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,159
so if you have two endpoints local

430
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,400
endpoints inside the private networks

431
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,200
which want to talk to the same

432
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,840
appear and they choose the same port

433
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,120
number udp or tcp based net would just

434
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,880
remap the port number and that's fine

435
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,840
and you can't do this for http so

436
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,559
this is why

437
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,080
to address this problem

438
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,799
a long time ago we

439
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,880
figured out that you can use the port

440
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,559
numbers and the verification tag which

441
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,039
is sap specific field

442
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,240
um like a connection identifier and then

443
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,600
you can

444
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
handle these local port number

445
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,280
collisions

446
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,039
so that's why

447
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
we thought it's a good or the authors

448
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,039
thought it's a good idea to specify

449
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,880
something um

450
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,960
http specific next slide

451
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,600
so this is basically a summary of the

452
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,880
comments

453
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,159
um

454
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,200
we got from the leds i haven't marked

455
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,720
with jd says

456
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,559
some of the comments were given by both

457
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,840
ads and

458
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,000
some only by one but it doesn't matter

459
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,799
um

460
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,559
we should address them

461
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,039
all or try to so the first one is that

462
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,200
um ip fragmentation handling um at the

463
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,000
net was an issue but i think we can deal

464
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
with that like using the same

465
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,440
terminology as done for udp or tcp

466
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,039
so that's not very hard

467
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,920
the

468
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,219
[Music]

469
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,400
the the question was how to

470
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,120
control the net friendly behavior which

471
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,080
is endpoints have to behave

472
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,000
in a specific way

473
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
when they are dealing with this net

474
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
scenario and

475
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,360
um the idea

476
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,480
was

477
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,840
was um just um if if one of the local

478
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,159
addresses is a private one you do this

479
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,240
or you have a socket option that's laid

480
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,640
out we can make that clearer that's not

481
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,720
that complicated um improved

482
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,840
multi-homing support was

483
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,400
um was asked for this means we can

484
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,600
have more even more examples um

485
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,880
showing that

486
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,000
um

487
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,919
it was asked for

488
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,320
that the nets support multiple external

489
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,360
addresses so we were focusing on the

490
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,440
simple case that only one external

491
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
address is available but this actually

492
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,600
means you have to have another field in

493
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,480
the netbinding table

494
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,760
then the remote address was taken out of

495
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,559
the net binding table based on a

496
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,150
research paper from

497
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,840
[Music]

498
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,400
australia

499
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
and that simplified a lot but

500
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
the question was

501
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,799
please bring it back at least if we are

502
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,600
not using this advanced version

503
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,919
um the the sap specific version of net

504
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,200
um it was asked

505
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,919
if the processing of http packets can be

506
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,120
simplified so that the net

507
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,440
function does not have to power the

508
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,120
packets

509
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,480
and

510
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,720
behave differently based on the chunk

511
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,320
type

512
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,440
when to add the state and whether an ad

513
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,240
function should send packets at all

514
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,679
because

515
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
right now the document

516
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,240
according to the document the net

517
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
function will send packets

518
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,120
and the last one is um the

519
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,200
the notion of http associations has to

520
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,640
be changed um because you

521
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,520
must support multiple associations with

522
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
the same port numbers

523
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,440
and that means you have to distinguish

524
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,720
them between

525
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,559
you have to distinguish them using the

526
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,159
verification tag

527
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,080
um

528
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,880
the issues here are have

529
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
ordered in a specific way

530
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,960
the

531
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,120
more easily to address one are on the

532
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,720
top of the more substantial ones are on

533
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,640
the bottom so if you go to the next

534
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,960
slide

535
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,600
i have listed possible ways forward um

536
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,039
the the first one is to stick with the

537
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,480
with this method

538
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,559
we are currently proposing

539
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,640
um

540
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,799
adding the

541
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,360
entries to the net table will add

542
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,159
complexity which is or i mean this is

543
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,559
already not

544
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,760
trivial so it adds complexity it gets

545
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,440
complexibility but we can address issue

546
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,360
two to five

547
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,120
um the nuts

548
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
the the the fragmentation stuff is just

549
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,799
wording i mean

550
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,480
you can't do anything wrong

551
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,520
um

552
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,039
we do have uh always uh the possibility

553
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,840
that the endpoints do not support this

554
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,600
additional mode so there is a fallback

555
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,960
mechanism on basically just using the

556
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,679
fallback mechanism taking out all the

557
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,760
sctp specific things

558
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,400
um is a possibility which would address

559
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,480
issue two to seven

560
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,440
um

561
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,840
so that would mean don't use the

562
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,799
verification tag don't disable restart

563
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,200
um add the external

564
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,039
remote addresses to the nut binding

565
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,880
table and basically this comes down to

566
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,559
a net function

567
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,880
which is not http aware it's just

568
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,399
outgoing packets establish

569
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,440
a relation you don't change port numbers

570
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,600
and that's it the drawback is that um

571
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,440
in case of a local port number

572
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,000
collisions you can't do anything um

573
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,720
so

574
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,039
the association can't be established

575
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,640
so that's the

576
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,360
well i would say um

577
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,960
the the

578
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,600
this especially this does not change the

579
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,919
definition of the association in the

580
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,039
endpoints

581
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,720
so this seems to be

582
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,799
addressing most of the issues the third

583
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,720
alternative is to drop this document at

584
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
all and go with the

585
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,320
ericsson proposal

586
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,440
or

587
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,840
the fourth way is to drop the work at

588
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
all and say

589
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,640
um if if we come up with a document

590
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,840
which

591
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,200
describes an almost http unaware not

592
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,039
we don't have to do

593
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,840
uh the work here

594
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
these are the four options i see and i

595
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,880
think it's the last slide right gauri

596
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
it is the last slide

597
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,960
and the fifth option

598
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
is propose something else

599
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,799
but do it now

600
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,840
so okay yeah i mean yeah

601
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,760
and my default option could be four or

602
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,559
could be one or two i mean um

603
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,559
literally we need people to come to the

604
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,240
mic and say whether

605
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,159
one or two is acceptable

606
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,000
as a way forward we've been working as a

607
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
working group on this for a while if

608
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
anyone who's commented or anyone who has

609
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,720
new insight

610
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,159
wishes to comment on whether one or two

611
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,559
is acceptable

612
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,960
i guess if you don't care then my job's

613
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,240
really easy

614
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,600
we've had a lot of review it's been

615
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,279
around for a lot of time we can go ahead

616
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,520
but if you care to

617
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,918
take up options one or two

618
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,919
can you offer some comment that

619
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,679
about this or agree to offer some

620
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,480
comment on the list

621
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,480
on the chat

622
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,600
colin asked if there are um

623
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,720
people having large-scale nets

624
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,399
i'm not aware of that

625
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,559
what i am aware of is

626
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,279
an implementation done by the australian

627
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,559
university

628
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,760
for freebsd and based on that

629
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,840
they did experiments and measurements on

630
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,039
scalability they took out they suggested

631
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,360
to take out the

632
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,440
remote address from the nut binding

633
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,120
table

634
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,559
yeah that was the remote address

635
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,120
discussion

636
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,559
okay claudio would you like to say

637
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,919
something

638
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:02,960
i mean

639
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
actually you need to speak up a little

640
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,520
bit we can't hear you i'm sorry

641
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,600
sorry it is

642
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,919
it doesn't work

643
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,200
i mean the the point here is

644
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,799
the reason why

645
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,600
i was trying to make some work here is

646
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,520
that rather than a big scaling that may

647
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,159
system may not exist yet

648
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:26,960
the

649
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,720
there is a problem

650
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,480
and if the problem is

651
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,360
that

652
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,799
what we are in instantiating today

653
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,720
in the cloud

654
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,120
so being interested in different name

655
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,279
phrasal and in different virtual

656
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,720
machines here

657
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,279
is network node that have acidity

658
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,399
connectivity so if this was not existing

659
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,320
before now the problem is actually and i

660
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,000
i think that and since the networking

661
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
the panel network using cloud is

662
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,080
provided here now

663
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,440
then we need to have a way forward

664
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
being one of

665
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,399
the ones

666
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,000
here or maybe

667
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,320
a brand new idea but

668
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,960
it is a problem that is just opened up

669
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,760
could i check if people in the room

670
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,279
heard the comment it was very difficult

671
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,760
on the stage to hear

672
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
ah um

673
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,559
can you

674
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,640
hear me

675
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,039
we could see you we could hear you but

676
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,400
it's very

677
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,840
[Music]

678
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,279
even soft is not the right thing it

679
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,200
could be the wrong mic is used

680
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,960
if you if you're using your headset

681
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,480
microphone

682
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,960
but moving the boom closer to your mouth

683
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,640
will probably help

684
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,440
can you hear me now

685
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,200
no it is still the same it is muffled

686
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,840
so moving

687
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,519
moving moving your microphone on your

688
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,399
headset close up to your mouth

689
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,559
now

690
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,200
not really no

691
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,320
hello

692
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,918
i think i have problems

693
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,799
that seems to be an improvement no it's

694
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,679
better

695
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,679
better

696
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,640
try again and speak up

697
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,440
yeah and if you talk loudly we can hear

698
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,840
you hello um but we missed the last

699
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,240
comment i'm afraid

700
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,519
okay you're coming through now please

701
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,240
repeat what you were saying

702
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,120
hello can you hear me now

703
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,880
yes hear me now

704
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,200
go ahead

705
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,840
i can't hear you

706
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,559
so

707
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,279
your microphone is now working so sorry

708
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,600
your microphone is now working and

709
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,000
now you just need you to be able to hear

710
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
us

711
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,039
okay we think i think one of the

712
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,159
comments he tried to make is that

713
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,480
the use case they have in mind is

714
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,080
something cloud based stuff

715
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,200
sure and

716
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,120
uh the document

717
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,279
the the original intention for the

718
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,480
document was not focusing on that

719
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,760
so

720
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,640
um

721
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,159
yeah i mean

722
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,559
michael my comment still is

723
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,320
can people live with

724
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,440
the

725
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
option one presented here and can they

726
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,079
live with option two uh the change of

727
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,839
scenario yeah it was understood in the

728
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,520
wicking group last call and it would be

729
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,440
good to address more cases if it's

730
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,199
possible

731
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,239
and

732
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,159
we need to decide on whether one or two

733
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,719
are acceptable i see martin in the line

734
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,599
and

735
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,520
i'd like to hear from martin i'd also

736
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,079
like to claudio afterwards

737
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,800
and if we can't get an audio connection

738
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,399
we can fold this up on a one-to-one

739
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,480
basis that would be easy so go ahead

740
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,800
martin yeah so martin duke google um

741
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,000
so with ad hat on um

742
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,839
i don't have a strong opinion here as

743
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,399
long as we have you know good consensus

744
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,520
in the group

745
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,879
um

746
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,119
as an individual i'd like to ask michael

747
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,760
as the editor um

748
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,000
if he has a preferred alternative of

749
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,960
these four

750
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,320
what his technical opinion is

751
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,440
well my opinion is

752
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,680
solution two addresses more issues

753
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,960
so it's more work than solution one but

754
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,839
um the issues brought up i mean

755
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,599
i can't argue them

756
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,040
and um

757
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,440
so solution two addresses

758
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,680
more of them

759
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,920
if it makes um

760
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,200
people happy in in a cloud environment

761
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,040
we have to see at least you don't have

762
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,720
to change the endpoints

763
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,880
you have the risk of higher

764
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,680
local port number collisions

765
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,680
okay thank you

766
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,079
thank you

767
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,920
claudio do you want to have one last say

768
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,520
or have you

769
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
decided we'll follow up off list go

770
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
ahead if you can either i can speak or i

771
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,839
can listen to so it is very hard for me

772
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,280
but i

773
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,880
what i say is that

774
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,160
we are running a prototype on option 3

775
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,880
and see what is possible to do

776
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,160
with that it's not ready yet but

777
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,640
hopefully it will be ready soon and i

778
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,440
will

779
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,200
share the result

780
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,160
the idea is that we will

781
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,880
work on the not support for linux and

782
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,760
then

783
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,359
possibly

784
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,320
do some implementation based on user

785
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,240
space http from vst

786
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,920
all of this will be

787
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,839
done in the open source

788
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,520
thank you and we'll follow up on the

789
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,920
list as well of course magnus please

790
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,599
yeah magnus western

791
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,200
my understanding of this problematic is

792
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
that we have three hexes we have one

793
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,280
which is can we support really support

794
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,640
multi

795
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,240
multi-homing well

796
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,040
the other axis is how many concurrent

797
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,200
sessions can we support

798
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,119
and that's the third is then the output

799
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,440
so to say is is how complex the solution

800
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,680
is so you can support multi-homing but

801
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,839
very few sessions with relatively low

802
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,200
complexity

803
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,560
or you can go

804
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,839
and i i think it's a question of

805
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,680
are we fine with maybe supporting

806
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,119
multi-homing

807
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,839
and how about supporting few sessions

808
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,440
and it might actually be sufficient for

809
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,200
the cloud uh

810
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,599
deployment cases

811
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,079
okay yeah and

812
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,680
we'll take collin

813
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,119
colin jenkins

814
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,040
so colin jones um

815
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,800
one i mean the issues in one seem sort

816
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,160
of broken and i don't see how to solve

817
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,880
them in any way but talking about so so

818
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,240
i'm not in favor of that but to also my

819
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,960
understanding of that uh and i could be

820
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,480
confused i don't

821
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,320
really see how that isn't true like any

822
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,560
time you just use the ip address and

823
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,480
have one-to-one mappings

824
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,560
um you have problems that anybody can

825
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,079
just scan through all the ports and now

826
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,160
your your nat is totally ddos like it's

827
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,960
totally trivial to ddos anything with

828
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,040
that type of scenario so i don't

829
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,119
actually really see how two works i i

830
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,920
think that as you dig into that

831
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,839
um you know there's no way to really

832
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,640
tell whether there was a conflict uh you

833
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,560
have to somehow drop the packets that

834
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,480
have a conflict otherwise you have two

835
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,839
two different things trying to use the

836
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,960
same port

837
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
um i mean i've seen many people not in

838
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,119
sctp but i've seen this tried in udp

839
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,800
multiple times and i've never seen it

840
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,520
work and i can't imagine why all the udp

841
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,800
problems with that type of solution

842
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,079
don't exactly map over to sctp as well

843
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,440
so i'm having a really hard time

844
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,119
understanding how to is a viable option

845
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,560
okay um maybe one point um

846
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
so right now

847
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,280
the

848
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,520
the the idea is that

849
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,079
um state can be added only by internal

850
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,359
hosts

851
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,520
and if there is a port number collision

852
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,599
the net box sends a packet back

853
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,520
indicating that so

854
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,839
um

855
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,880
a node in the private network can

856
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,599
can

857
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,720
um

858
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,680
can do a ddos by establishing a lot of

859
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,000
state yes that's true

860
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,040
um

861
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,160
if that if that is not a ddos but by

862
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,920
chance

863
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,640
and the local endpoint is not relying on

864
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,560
that particular port

865
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,720
it can

866
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,800
it gets a notification from the middle

867
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,040
box that this port is taken and it can

868
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,200
choose a different form and reconnect

869
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,598
but a local node can do adidas yes

870
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,640
thank you right we're going to have to

871
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,040
decide one of these ways forward and

872
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,119
we're going to have to decide shortly

873
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,880
after this meeting

874
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,640
there is obviously time to discuss on

875
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,400
list and obviously time to get people

876
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,480
together to find their opinions but we

877
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,960
do have to make a decision because the

878
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,400
working groups have the document for a

879
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,760
long time

880
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,079
so i'd encourage people to try and

881
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,440
follow up on what they've just said at

882
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,200
the mic or what they think on the list

883
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,880
if you're in any doubt please forward to

884
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,119
the chairs and we will try and help

885
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,280
to understand the positions and then we

886
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,839
will call out a possible way forward for

887
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,599
the working group

888
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,400
thank you for the talk

889
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,759
we'll take the next presentation

890
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,400
it was you

891
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,240
and

892
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,800
we have oh i have to press share

893
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,760
okay so magnus on dtls over http go

894
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,839
ahead minus yes so let's see just

895
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,119
trying to eat the mica um so i'm uh

896
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,839
magnus westland um my co-author is

897
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,359
claudio for theory and john matson um

898
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,560
next slide

899
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,800
so we've been working on this draft and

900
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,839
uh

901
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,839
i mean the highest point is here we're

902
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,599
trying to address the user message limit

903
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,280
of detail assist the paper rfc 623

904
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,839
uh we have this communication with gdp

905
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,440
etcetera they have a problem in the

906
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,800
several of their ram protocols

907
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,280
since last meeting we have received some

908
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,000
feedback from liang

909
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,200
we also hadn't

910
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,880
contracted out an implementation of the

911
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,119
specification we got some feedback we

912
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,200
have implemented some of these so far

913
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,119
and it continues

914
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,319
and i have to

915
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,839
remind you that there's

916
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,839
two ipr declarations from ericsson on

917
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,000
this document

918
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,319
next slide

919
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,640
so this update for this towards this

920
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,119
meeting was fairly significant

921
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,760
not in solution space but also a lot of

922
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,400
details clarifications etc about solving

923
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,400
issues

924
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,839
we clarified about the theoretical

925
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,880
message length limitations

926
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,640
and we're saying that basically up to

927
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,400
2.2 to the power 64 minus one byte is

928
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,960
is is i mean you won't really limit the

929
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,720
support of or say the need for

930
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
supporting pointers etc

931
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,000
um

932
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but that's the potential for a message

933
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,960
size

934
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,680
which i think is reasonable

935
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,319
we also look into some of these ssb api

936
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,560
limitations might limit the sender

937
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,680
further

938
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,599
but shouldn't be an issue for a receiver

939
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,880
so

940
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,040
a sender that knows

941
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
he can deal with or ensure that you have

942
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,480
a stack that matches that um we also

943
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,520
looked into stream usage update

944
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,720
there's

945
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,200
this is minor in some sense but actually

946
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,520
most main point here is

947
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,400
detail ssdp before details process the

948
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,640
message doesn't know what's incoming if

949
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,079
that's user data or a detailer's message

950
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,760
that has some impact anyway of how you

951
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,920
can send this so we thought you were be

952
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,040
able to really relax the limitation of

953
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,720
how it's ending and it's up to the

954
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,480
sender so to say to

955
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,760
send on whatever stream they want to

956
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,920
because it's anyway doesn't matter until

957
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,040
the detailer stack process the message

958
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,359
uh we also looked into shutdown

959
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,560
procedures clarifying those we have a

960
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,359
new section on http api considerations

961
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,200
trying to note what kind of

962
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,280
special functionality you might need on

963
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,560
the satb stack to support as well

964
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,319
and the number of clarifications on

965
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,280
various things so it's a fairly large

966
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,720
update if you looked at the draft and

967
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,480
the diff so

968
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,119
next slide

969
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,040
so i want to remind you about what we're

970
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,960
really addressing in this draft compared

971
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,440
to rfc 683

972
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,040
so it's the message message length

973
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,800
we also have the

974
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,440
sap association handshake now negotiates

975
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,280
to support of details or sdp

976
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,880
we're trying to minimize the impact on

977
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880
ulp protocol

978
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,640
basically having is

979
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,599
so if

980
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,359
what you can support in sctp we can

981
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,359
basically support over data ssdp also

982
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,160
and it's slightly wider than what 683 or

983
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,839
the number of features is that's

984
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,760
slightly easier to use

985
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,400
or say no limits

986
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,599
um

987
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,760
addressing this uh i want to note i mean

988
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,839
that 683

989
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,000
per its original publication it was

990
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,640
using details 1.0 had less limitation

991
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,560
and what it has now since rc 8996 forced

992
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,520
details upgrade to 1.2

993
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,920
because

994
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,920
for example to support a long-lived sap

995
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,000
association details 1.2 has the

996
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,680
renegotiation

997
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,960
security issues which has to do with

998
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,319
there are some challenges there are

999
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,680
implementing security there have been

1000
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,599
some attacks etc so people has a

1001
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,000
tendency to turn it off so availability

1002
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,599
prospects and some challenge

1003
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,000
implementations it also limits the

1004
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,760
number of negotiations to 65k

1005
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,960
and for detail is 1.3

1006
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
there is no renegotiation longer with

1007
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,400
mutual authentication

1008
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,839
the only thing you can do is a key

1009
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,760
update on and that doesn't update the

1010
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,359
mast secret

1011
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,359
which means that you don't re-key sstp

1012
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,280
off either

1013
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,200
so your session length is now much more

1014
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,040
limited due to basically when you're

1015
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,480
running out of stp health key usages

1016
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,319
you have to terminate the session

1017
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,920
restart

1018
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,440
and you will not have any forward

1019
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,920
secrecy during that re any updates you

1020
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,640
do for details 1.3

1021
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,480
so that's basically

1022
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,720
some of these challenges here and and

1023
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,680
then we also have the sntp auth

1024
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,119
i mean uh hmac show one is is

1025
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,640
is aging

1026
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,160
you probably want something newer for

1027
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,359
the future so um but yeah so let's go on

1028
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,560
so that being some discussion on the

1029
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,920
main list but

1030
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,599
from my perspective

1031
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,359
i think there's two realistic ways

1032
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,200
forward

1033
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,920
obsoleting rfc 683 when publishing draft

1034
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,359
src

1035
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,839
which would have been the default

1036
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,560
publishing as an alternative rfc to 1683

1037
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,200
without obsoleting is another

1038
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,200
and that would allow people to update

1039
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,560
683

1040
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,760
and if etc if they want to do something

1041
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,440
try to do something there which doesn't

1042
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,520
infringe the ipr

1043
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,839
um

1044
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,280
or

1045
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,839
see what you can do um

1046
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,880
so i mean 683 has limited applicability

1047
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,599
and has its security issues so i think

1048
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,359
something maybe needs to be done anyway

1049
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,440
but it's

1050
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,160
uh so

1051
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,079
yeah i think we can go into some

1052
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,359
discussion i think michael had a

1053
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,000
slightly different view of this so

1054
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,760
i'd like to take discussion on this side

1055
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,760
if we can yeah and

1056
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,960
as a chair i can say that we would be

1057
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,079
okay if the working group decides to not

1058
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,880
obsolete 68

1059
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,119
686083 using this draft we can make that

1060
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,119
decision later if we wish to as a

1061
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,839
working group so it is a possibility

1062
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,960
so um what do people think about the

1063
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,560
options and what do people want to say

1064
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,400
in response to this particular proposal

1065
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,119
for a way forward

1066
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,119
anybody got any questions or comments

1067
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,040
michael

1068
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,720
go ahead michael

1069
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,559
yeah i'm clicking

1070
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,400
i am

1071
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,920
um

1072
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,520
i i

1073
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,760
i answer to the to the mailing list so

1074
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,559
from a technical point of view i think

1075
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,240
rc 6083 needs to be updated um

1076
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,280
i'm not arguing on any technical

1077
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,760
things right now

1078
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,480
my point is that

1079
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,480
in my view dtls for http is something

1080
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,480
like tls for tcp or dtls for udp so

1081
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,800
um replacing

1082
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,400
an rc which

1083
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,480
which is which you can implement in open

1084
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,240
source and which you can use by a

1085
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,720
document

1086
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,040
proposed by

1087
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,880
a company

1088
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,040
enforcing its own ipr

1089
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,160
seems to me suboptimal i mean up to now

1090
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,960
we have every everything we did in http

1091
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,000
was

1092
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,839
backed up by open source

1093
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,200
and

1094
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
at least when it came to working group

1095
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,119
last call we had some implementations

1096
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,040
and this is not possible here

1097
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,030
so

1098
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,680
[Music]

1099
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,160
that's why

1100
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,040
i'm not arguing technically but the ipr

1101
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,920
stuff

1102
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,200
hold by

1103
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,559
the company

1104
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,559
working on this document is something

1105
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,240
which

1106
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,919
i'm not in favor of

1107
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,720
no

1108
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,160
understood um

1109
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,680
from my perspective i always want to

1110
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,079
ensure that we're

1111
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,240
i would say that we then in that case if

1112
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,520
you're willing to maybe potentially

1113
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,599
drive some alternatives here i would go

1114
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,880
with then

1115
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,960
b so we or at least two word speed is

1116
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,200
for no so we don't get stuck in a

1117
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,280
situation where no progress at all is

1118
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,079
made

1119
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,920
because

1120
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,359
i mean we're doing this work to ensure

1121
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,200
that gdp has a reference for something

1122
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,040
that needs to resolve

1123
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,119
uh and and and

1124
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,680
ending up where we have no progress

1125
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,680
and and just spend a lot of time working

1126
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,280
on it that's

1127
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,680
not productive at all so i wanted some

1128
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,319
direction at least that enables us or 3d

1129
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,240
people to make progress here in the end

1130
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,359
and i i

1131
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,359
i noticed that you might did suggest

1132
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,000
that this should be taken to gdp but

1133
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,559
that also doesn't feel particularly well

1134
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,839
either so

1135
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,800
i i see but i mean if we now decide that

1136
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,440
this goes as an alternative um and it's

1137
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,680
not updating rfc 6083 um i think

1138
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,040
6083 needs an update so this would mean

1139
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,000
bringing up another document at the ietf

1140
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,040
um which doubles the load

1141
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
and i'm so i'm

1142
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,880
i mean and the other point is why should

1143
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,920
anyone

1144
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,359
i mean

1145
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,760
normally things are brought to the ietf

1146
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,720
to work on it in a community which

1147
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,760
improves

1148
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,520
the document quality and

1149
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,640
for me

1150
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,599
a company coming to the ietf wanting to

1151
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,720
enforce its its ipr in a document just

1152
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,839
means

1153
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,240
if if i'm working for a competitor i

1154
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,319
would just shut up and

1155
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,880
don't say anything hope that there are

1156
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,559
issues in the document and once the

1157
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,440
document has been published file iprs

1158
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,240
or even before that file ipr song

1159
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,599
fixing this

1160
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,880
so

1161
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,119
but

1162
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,720
i mean just leaving two documents

1163
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,400
in parallel there and not saying

1164
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,720
anything is also not i mean this helps

1165
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,800
create gpp but

1166
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,559
um

1167
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,960
yeah but so i mean my question to you

1168
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,720
michael are you willing to try to do

1169
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,319
something about finding an alternative

1170
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,640
here because i mean if if no one is

1171
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,559
either doing an alternative

1172
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,559
then we're at like some type of impasse

1173
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,400
and it doesn't make any progress either

1174
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,680
so

1175
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,920
i would be willing on on what i would i

1176
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,839
mean i would be willing to work on an

1177
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,640
update on 6083 that's why i started to

1178
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,880
to i'll be a co-author of your document

1179
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,839
but

1180
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,359
um

1181
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,280
and if people are interested in it i'm

1182
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,119
happy to do so but

1183
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,559
um

1184
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,880
if no one else is interested then it's

1185
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,760
done

1186
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,640
go ahead do whatever you want

1187
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,760
i think i i can comment at this point so

1188
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,079
um i will of course um offer the

1189
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,160
opportunity for a ad to comment if he

1190
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,359
wishes

1191
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,119
but my understanding of what we've

1192
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,119
talked about here is

1193
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,440
that the working group could decide not

1194
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,839
to update

1195
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:01,040
um six or eight three by obsoleting it

1196
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,599
so we we continue this work is is a

1197
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,680
proposal that's on the table that

1198
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,079
inevitably might mean that two further

1199
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,520
things could happen

1200
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,760
another id could emerge which updates

1201
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,760
six or eight three

1202
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,160
or by the time that this

1203
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,079
what we're considering has reached

1204
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,800
fruition we decide that 6083 should

1205
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,000
finally be

1206
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,960
obsoleted anyway because the ipr issues

1207
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,400
have been either gone away or have been

1208
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,240
encountered or

1209
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,559
are well known whatever the outcome

1210
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,640
so there is a way to proceed here which

1211
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,559
means that we continue the work item

1212
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,559
without doing the update with the

1213
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,240
penalty that we may have to publish

1214
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,920
another rfc either to obsolete 6083 or

1215
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,839
to update it as a parallel spec

1216
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,839
and i'm asking the working group and

1217
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,760
we'll do via the mailing list whether

1218
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,119
that is an acceptable way forward

1219
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,119
does my id wish to say anything at this

1220
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,680
point about creating two parallel specs

1221
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,440
or does he wait want to wait and see

1222
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,559
what the working group says

1223
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:16,800
ah i i will confess to not having again

1224
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,640
a terribly strong opinion here um

1225
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,960
it is

1226
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,839
it is a problem if we're in a situation

1227
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,119
where

1228
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,640
you know the bsd implementation which

1229
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,480
thinks the relatively important one

1230
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,880
cannot follow the spec

1231
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,160
so um

1232
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,720
i i i

1233
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,680
i'm initially like fairly sympathetic to

1234
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,520
the way you describe the story that that

1235
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,839
may be

1236
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,559
sticking this starting with b um i mean

1237
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,960
i i don't hear anyone stepping up really

1238
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,839
to write the the you know the the open

1239
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,680
source ipr free

1240
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,200
version of this

1241
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,640
um

1242
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,319
so if if

1243
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,760
if if we want to

1244
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,920
so it sounds to me like the unless the

1245
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,760
ip unless the ipr rights are you know

1246
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,680
loose enough to to allow this kind of

1247
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,599
work

1248
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,319
i it seems to me the outcome will be

1249
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,800
that you have 60 83 still functional

1250
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,079
and then a

1251
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,319
then a alternative to 60 80 you know

1252
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,400
alternative improvement to 6083 that

1253
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,640
will be used by some implementations and

1254
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,880
and i i i don't maybe necessarily

1255
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,720
understand exactly what the

1256
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,960
what the interoperability

1257
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,880
implications of that are and and if

1258
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,400
magnus can answer that that would be

1259
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,960
interesting but um it seemed inevitably

1260
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,720
we're driving in that direction yeah and

1261
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,280
we may have to update 6083 anyway for

1262
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,119
security reasons because the um the

1263
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,760
security part of the spec changes

1264
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,680
so

1265
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,200
things security algorithms will be

1266
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,119
obsoleted so

1267
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,640
that may have to be maintained as a

1268
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,799
separate document if we decide to go

1269
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,240
along that path but i guess we

1270
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,760
acknowledge this by going along this

1271
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,720
path now and given that 3gpp needs this

1272
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,200
um i don't think like doing nothing

1273
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,680
doesn't strike me as a alternative

1274
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,079
either so i know magnus can you speak at

1275
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,440
all to

1276
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,920
the interrupt the interoperability

1277
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,040
issues of a 6083 and this

1278
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,680
so i mean together the current draft is

1279
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,640
of the new proposal is very clear on

1280
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,400
when you're negotiating the handshake

1281
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,079
using the uh

1282
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,400
this uh

1283
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,160
defined method for detecting it the 683

1284
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,920
you basically

1285
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,839
you have no clear indicator that you're

1286
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,319
going to do 683 unless you you see it's

1287
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,160
sctp off and then there's a detailed

1288
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,680
handshake that's how you detect that

1289
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,880
it's happening

1290
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,160
and and this other one you're doing the

1291
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,160
handshake in the association handshake

1292
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,240
you will detect okay i want to do this

1293
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,960
so you know that this is and and

1294
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,799
if future proposal could do the same but

1295
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,559
with the different identifiers you could

1296
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,960
negotiate which you are doing so i think

1297
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,839
there's

1298
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,599
at least power existence is not an issue

1299
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,760
okay excellent so then um if i

1300
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,200
understand correctly

1301
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,359
if you had a 60-83 endpoint um

1302
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,839
well actually okay so let me back up so

1303
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,359
with your draft if you had an employee

1304
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,960
supporting your draft

1305
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,160
and it

1306
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,520
and try

1307
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,040
they would not see this option from the

1308
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,799
pier and so it would recognize what was

1309
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,000
going on

1310
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,799
with the 6083 endpoint it will see dtls

1311
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,319
payloads

1312
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,720
um and think that it is doing 6083 when

1313
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,160
it's actually doing what your draft is

1314
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,839
doing

1315
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,000
no because so it's actually defined how

1316
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,319
you fall back to 60 to 3 behavior from

1317
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:33,280
from

1318
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,680
from from our specified behavior and

1319
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,040
it's it's you're never going to end up

1320
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,119
there unless you have a policy for

1321
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,040
willingly allowing it because it's

1322
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,119
otherwise it will be security risk

1323
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,839
so okay you will yeah all right i mean

1324
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,119
it sounds like you've got an approach

1325
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,680
and we can we can wordsmith it but

1326
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,520
that's good um

1327
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,040
uh yeah i mean i think ideally there

1328
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,480
would be some sort of minimal update to

1329
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,920
6083.

1330
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,839
again

1331
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:58,799
um

1332
00:56:58,799 --> 00:56:59,680
uh

1333
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,000
it doesn't i don't it doesn't strike me

1334
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,280
as there being enormous amount of energy

1335
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,319
to do so um so it would be nice to

1336
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,079
appear be in a place where we can live

1337
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,359
without one

1338
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,280
right i think that's a

1339
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,599
a fair thing and if that emerges in the

1340
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,280
future that can be always going to do

1341
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,280
maintenance of aspects so this is okay

1342
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,160
as well

1343
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,040
okay

1344
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,760
fine thanks this proposal will be taken

1345
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,400
to the list and i'd happily work with

1346
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,760
the people who've spoken here just to

1347
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,599
make sure that the right proposal words

1348
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:28,799
are written on when we send it to the

1349
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,119
mailing list yeah okay how are we doing

1350
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,839
on time we're a bit short um yeah let's

1351
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,160
skip this then so and

1352
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,920
there are additional slides shall we

1353
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,160
yeah there was in time permits to

1354
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,640
discuss an issue but it's actually

1355
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,440
so

1356
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,720
yeah um i think people can read those uh

1357
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,240
i will post to the main list about the

1358
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,079
issues or other things when we work with

1359
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,000
it so we we have a few smaller there's

1360
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,440
one thing with the first of those is

1361
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,920
around details 1.2 is a bit

1362
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,000
annoying but i think we probably have

1363
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,760
one some way forward

1364
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,280
we'll have to figure it something out

1365
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,280
but yeah okay thank you yeah

1366
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,839
please continue to discuss on the list

1367
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,440
woo can we take one more talk

1368
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,680
short no

1369
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,520
you're asking me yeah i'm asking you

1370
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,799
because you're in the room

1371
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,040
which

1372
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,720
how do we proceed on the lfs ops draft

1373
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,000
in the few minutes we have remaining

1374
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,599
even if we don't don't do the status

1375
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,200
review on it

1376
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,040
yeah let's just skip ahead to the

1377
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,680
question and have some discussion yes

1378
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,440
please

1379
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,720
if there's room

1380
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,319
for the next session we can go from

1381
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,119
there

1382
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,200
yeah we'll find room to discuss properly

1383
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,880
but let's raise it

1384
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,079
so the

1385
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,359
you you have

1386
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,839
the l4s

1387
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:57,200
ops as the editing document you want to

1388
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,280
cut straight to the question and give us

1389
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,040
a very quick run through in one minute

1390
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,480
to where we are are you online sure uh

1391
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,040
yep i'm online

1392
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,640
um yes let's get forward

1393
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,119
yeah keep keep going um

1394
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,720
keep going

1395
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,000
um one there's one to do um left in the

1396
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,359
draft um and so i'll be asking for

1397
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,119
input from the working group on how to

1398
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,880
um address that

1399
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,480
uh that open question

1400
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,400
um in the next slide

1401
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,240
is the

1402
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,200
um so no no updates to draft since the

1403
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,359
last ietf um i do have a work in

1404
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:40,400
progress draft o3 at this point only has

1405
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,839
some typo fixes some misspellings etc

1406
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:46,480
um uh

1407
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,319
certainly new contributions would be

1408
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,760
accepted if there are uh additional

1409
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,359
uh materials that need to be covered in

1410
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,599
the draft but i've not um

1411
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,079
heard any contributions or comments of

1412
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,839
that

1413
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:01,440
nature since the last idea

1414
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,040
so the original plan for this document

1415
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,880
was for it to remain a draft during the

1416
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,280
l4s experiment and

1417
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,000
the

1418
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,920
question here is is that still the

1419
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,760
desired path forward

1420
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,040
um

1421
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,599
or should we be moving towards uh

1422
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,160
finishing this and publishing as an rfc

1423
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,520
i'll

1424
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,720
give it to

1425
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,118
comments

1426
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,640
all right i'll do it myself i'll insert

1427
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,359
myself in the mic um i would suggest

1428
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,040
that it would benefit those who want to

1429
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,280
work with l4s to declare victory on this

1430
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,640
move it forward as an rfc shortly after

1431
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,119
or with the alpharest drafts and then

1432
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,640
immediately open a bisdraft uh to

1433
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,119
capture things we learned dirt

1434
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,400
learned during the alpha price

1435
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,599
experiment um as

1436
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,160
your slides show the draft is pretty

1437
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,599
much stable i don't think there's any

1438
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,599
major contributions and i think getting

1439
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,000
it out a bit more broadly is probably a

1440
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,200
good thing for all concerned

1441
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,240
okay any other comments

1442
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,720
yeah martin duke google um

1443
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,799
during the l4s experiment is an

1444
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:15,359
interesting phrasing to me like

1445
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,319
like how long is that

1446
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:21,759
at least one itf cycle

1447
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,400
well that's that's no time in itf time

1448
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,160
um i would just

1449
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,119
i i have no i no no idea martin but i

1450
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,280
would suggest having a draft open to

1451
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,520
collect lessons learned as people learn

1452
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,760
them would be a good thing and then

1453
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,680
sometime the future we get to we we get

1454
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,960
to have this slide on the best draft

1455
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,240
fair enough i mean the question is

1456
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,160
directed more to greg than to david's

1457
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,680
proposal um

1458
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,760
because i mean like you know

1459
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,040
in theory the air force experience

1460
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,359
continues until we publish ps

1461
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,319
which seems like too long um

1462
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:57,920
uh like i i don't know

1463
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,079
i mean i guess my question would be to

1464
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:02,160
what extent are operators like

1465
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,319
either already running this or or like

1466
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,640
poised to start like tomorrow

1467
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,440
um like what are we expecting like very

1468
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,440
quick operational experience to to

1469
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,440
emerge in in like the next few months or

1470
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,880
is it gonna be years and years before we

1471
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,920
have

1472
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,680
additional learnings to

1473
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,640
improve this document

1474
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,599
i would anticipate it's um

1475
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,599
on the order of

1476
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,039
small numbers of years before

1477
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,000
we have significant deployment and and

1478
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,480
operational experience um

1479
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,480
not not weeks or

1480
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,319
short numbers of months okay well then

1481
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,960
as an individual um i would say that uh

1482
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,039
that that answer tells me that maybe

1483
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,440
david's solution is a good one

1484
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,200
um but i'll give i know we're short on

1485
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,759
time so okay thanks mirrors in the queue

1486
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:58,720
yeah just a very quick plus one to

1487
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,960
publish it right now okay i mean the

1488
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,559
options we have in the working group to

1489
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,319
consider are whether we freeze the

1490
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:05,520
document

1491
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,960
and we hold it because we think we're

1492
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,359
going to immediately update it in the

1493
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:12,319
short number of its cycles or we opt to

1494
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,440
publish

1495
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,520
so this is what greg's raising and this

1496
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,200
is what we'd like feedback from we've

1497
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,200
heard a few comments here we will of

1498
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,880
course ask on the list to see if there

1499
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,960
are any further comments but we've heard

1500
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,559
the comments thank you ever so much for

1501
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,400
contributing thank you for coming to

1502

and we will continue on friday with a

1504
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,520
much longer slot

1505
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,280
and do come and join us on friday please

1506
