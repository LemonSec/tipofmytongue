1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,160
well you can't get into restaurants

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,519
restaurants they want to restaurants

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,839
it's 2 30 local time we intend to start

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,760
on time a very busy agenda so

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,560
so uh

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,200
welcome to idea 113

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
routing working group

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,239
and we'll start with meeting

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,800
as usual not well please make yourself

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,120
familiar with how your contributions and

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,599
participation in itf is treated

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,160
ipr disclosure at routing working group

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,719
will ask you to declare ipr

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,280
when the individual document progressed

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
towards working group document and

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,239
before working group last call unless we

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,680
have received all ipr statements for all

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,000
authors and contributors documents won't

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,960
progress

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,720
uh let's review our agenda quickly there

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,640
are more explanation on the wiki so i'll

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,880
be very quick

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,320
uh we'll have uh young for qos thanks

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
for authors we are pretty much ready for

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,880
working with plus call last reviews apn

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
will update us with all the progress

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
we've made over the last couple of eight

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,479
years we've got number of research

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,200
topics a lot of interesting new work as

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,600
well as update on rfc 5798 thanks ac for

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,240
taking it up

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,960
uh we don't have any rc's since 112.

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,600
we've recently adopted point to multiple

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
and bfd for vrp

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
uh working document

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,840
the qs model as i said is getting pretty

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,479
much ready for working what's called

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,479
uh reebok standard as well bgp peak is

44
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,200
pending ad review

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,959
it is here too

46
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,639
to remember

47
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,440
uh so thanks for uh stuart bryant for

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,239
reviewing uh tilfa draft

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,360
there's still a couple of reviews that

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
needs to be addressed by the authors

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
uh atnbgp has reviewed couple of

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,319
by a couple of people we need more

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,840
reviews here

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,480
and authors of the service six egress

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,080
protection draft have requested working

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
group plus call so we are about to start

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,319
the process

58
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,000
and uh please use our wiki to

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,840
get more information about progress of

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,360
the drafts about work that's going on

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,680
there's a new work coming in

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,280
so we are ready to start

63
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,879
engine you are going to start sharing

64
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,920
criteria preloaded already

65
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,480
center is asi um

66
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,800
yeah you can do the slide sharing

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,599
yourself just click the share preloaded

68
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,000
slides

69
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,040
okay so you will be uh moving the slides

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
for me right

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,840
um you i can do it or you can if you

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,560
prefer to do it yourself it's also okay

73
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
you can do click the share preloaded

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,519
slides

75
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
oh i'll do it for you then

76
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,280
okay

77
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,879
all right i can start right

78
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,280
yes please okay

79
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
so hello everyone my name is asim

80
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,200
chaudhary and

81
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,920
i am going to cover qscang model

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,159
next slide

83
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,159
okay

84
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,200
so in the latest version of the draft we

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,159
have added a configuration for

86
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,640
randomly detect and weighted randomly

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
detect

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
we have

89
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,600
taken care of lot of young doctors

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
command we have

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,600
added a lot of acronym same definitions

92
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
we have improved the language and

93
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
explanations

94
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,840
and we have had a lot of references as

95
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,199
well

96
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,120
and in addition we were facing some

97
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,040
warning draft warnings we have taken

98
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,639
care of those

99
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,360
and based on those modifications we have

100
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,680
come up with version 7 of the draft and

101
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,840
we have published it

102
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,638
next slide please

103
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,720
all right so if we are looking to

104
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,600
randomly detect configuration

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
it's something which fall under

106
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,759
algorithmic drop

107
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,320
and drop algorithm drop algorithm is

108
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
appended to the queue configuration now

109
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,440
the queue can be configured in line

110
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,160
versus a queue can be configured as a

111
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
template

112
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,120
so

113
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,800
so under the queue we have drop

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,759
algorithm and under the drop algorithm

115
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,560
we have case statement for randomly

116
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,240
detect or weighted randomly detect

117
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
now if we talk about randomly detected

118
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
configurations

119
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
we have a minimum threshold value and

120
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
maximum threshold value and there are

121
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,479
corresponding units to it

122
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,360
so

123
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,160
the units could be in bytes or in time

124
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,759
like millisecond

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,720
or it could be in percentage

126
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,039
and uh there is a configuration for

127
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,080
weight

128
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
now what is weight

129
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,639
is a decay factor in calculating the

130
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,800
average queue size

131
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,840
now weight value is two's exponent

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
so for example if somebody configure a

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
weight value of 2

134
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,639
then 2 raised to power 2 become 4 and

135
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,639
that means the instantaneous value of

136
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,039
the queue will account for 25

137
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,800
and the previous

138
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,199
average queue size will account for 25

139
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,880
75

140
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,880
and so and so forth it reflect or effect

141
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,080
uh the

142
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,120
the

143
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,720
randomly detect

144
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
algorithm functionality accordingly

145
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,360
now we also have provider configuration

146
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,960
for max probability value so it is the

147
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,680
probability of dropping a packet at the

148
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
max threshold value

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
we have allowed the configuration of

150
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
units for e2

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,520
and the unit could be in per cent or per

152
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560
thousand

153
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
or per million

154
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,400
and and could be also a probability

155
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,919
denominator

156
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,919
so for example if somebody wants to

157
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,000
configure like you know i want to drop

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,520
one packet off for every four thousand

159
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
packet then he would configure

160
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,759
probability denominator

161
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,840
and set the probability value as four

162
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,000
thousand

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,880
so

164
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
also you know if you look into randomly

165
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
detect configuration we have allowed the

166
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,319
configuration for ecn enabled that is

167
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,800
explicit congestion notification

168
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,759
and what does that mean is

169
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,919
instead of dropping the packet if you

170
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,919
find that the packet need to be dropped

171
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,720
so if the ecn is enabled and the packet

172
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
has ect bit enabled

173
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,160
then uh instead of dropping the packet

174
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,919
it will be marked the congestion

175
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,160
experience bit will be marked and it

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,720
will not it will be sent the packet will

177
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,560
be sent and will not be dropped

178
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,840
next slide please

179
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,759
all right so so vt red

180
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,319
is very very similar to randomly detect

181
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,639
except that we have multiple profiles

182
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,840
per queue

183
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
and that means every single profile

184
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,319
represents one color of

185
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,199
traffic so for example if we have a dhcp

186
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,440
value of af41 we can configure that as a

187
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,000
profile and which will have its own

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,919
minimum value and maximum value

189
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,680
uh and corresponding you know

190
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,639
probability value and weight value

191
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
and so and

192
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,120
you know similarly we can have a dhcp

193
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,240
value af 42 f43 or af21 as separate

194
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,560
profiles uh under the same queue

195
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,000
next slide please

196
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,320
all right so uh as next step uh we have

197
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,600
got you know a lot of uh comments to be

198
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
taken care of

199
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,760
we have already worked on quite a few so

200
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,360
far

201
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,760
and we are working further to address

202
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
that

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
you know some of them involved improving

204
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
nomenclature

205
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
enhancing descriptions

206
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,519
correcting some of the definitions

207
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,080
formatting one or two sections

208
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,200
and further improving the references

209
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,399
and also we are you know working on to

210
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,320
improve further explanation into the

211
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
draft

212
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
also you know while working on the draft

213
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,839
we actually had uh added a lot of

214
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,200
features to the extent that you know

215
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,040
we have

216
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,640
you know if feature for a lot of actions

217
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,560
which we thought that some vendor may

218
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,279
support and some vendor may not support

219
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,080
but eventually we found that you know

220
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,040
it is causing uh too many features to be

221
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,279
there and frankly speaking those are not

222
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,760
required so we want to simplify the

223
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,800
draft to get rid of some of the features

224
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,360
uh which are anyway common features and

225
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,200
expected to be implemented

226
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,480
and so we'll be uh simplifying the front

227
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
uh draft further by removing some of the

228
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
features

229
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
also uh

230
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,279
for the statistics uh

231
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,760
we had created a separate draft for the

232
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,560
stats for the qs model the reason that

233
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
time was uh

234
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,600
that it it required a lot of discussion

235
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,079
for every single counter and we thought

236
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,760
that we'll be taking too much time and

237
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,920
we can separate it out

238
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,880
uh but over a period of last several

239
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,440
months we have quite stabilized the

240
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600
counters we are not

241
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,680
further changing

242
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,200
except that the blue red counter we have

243
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,920
added this time so it's a pretty stable

244
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,440
draft and we agree on those counters and

245
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
so we want to merge back that particular

246
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,720
stats

247
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,920
module

248
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,000
back into the qs

249
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,519
model so that we have a common

250
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,760
model for configuration as well as for

251
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
statistics

252
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,240
um yeah i would like to address and see

253
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,360
some of the comments from the working

254
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
group on that

255
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,839
thank you very much if there are any

256
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,360
questions i'm ready to address that

257
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,000
any questions

258
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,720
uh i see there's comments from adrian on

259
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,040
the chat so probably we could

260
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,440
do it offline thanks really good work

261
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,839
and we are getting

262
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,399

yep

267
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,639
i'm uh ac linden from cisco uh

268
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,279
i d yeah

269
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,680
dogra isn't here isn't on the call but

270
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,519
he's the

271
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,120
team lead for the ios xe um

272
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,720
implementation of brp

273
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
version three and steve natas was the

274
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,000
original not the original offer of vrp

275
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,360
but the original offer of the of

276
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,639
or the

277
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,160
offer of our of

278
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,120
our of rfc

279
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,880
5798 which took it to v3 and

280
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,079
consolidated stuff that was in both the

281
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,040
existing rfcs and um

282
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,079
and a draft on

283
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,399
uh vrp for

284
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,240
ipv6

285
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,800
next slide

286
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,160
now unless unless you've been living

287
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
under a rock

288
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,560
you're aware that a lot of the major

289
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,040
vendors my cisco

290
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,600
and others have adopted um

291
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,720
a plan to try and

292
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,920
uh replace their uh documentation

293
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
replace all the terminology that is

294
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,880
non-inclusive into inclusive

295
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,680
and at the same time this was happening

296
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,399
you know a few years back and then about

297
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,000
a year later the ietf came up with a

298
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
with the same and and

299
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,040
others i'm not really keeping up with

300
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,120
other standards organizations but other

301
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,240
standards organization did the same

302
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
so

303
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,160
as you're you know from dating back to

304
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,279
80s

305
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,600
the whole terminology of master and

306
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,440
slave was very common in uh networking

307
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,959
protocols

308
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,320
you know in both in the ietf and ieee so

309
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,120
what what the main motivation was

310
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,959
we looked at

311
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,320
vrp version 3 and rfc

312
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,040
5798

313
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,399
and we could see that

314
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,959
just issuing the draft that updated it

315
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,079
it was almost as if every paragraph

316
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,199
included the state master i mean

317
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,320
uh there there definitely wasn't a page

318
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,560
that didn't have it and what we chose

319
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,120
was to leave

320
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
it wasn't master and slave it was master

321
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,120
and backup in in you know in brp since i

322
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,800
was involved with the first one it was

323
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,519
about in 1994

324
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,120
that the vrp version 2

325
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,079
uh became a standard um

326
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,160
ever since then it's always been ma

327
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,959
master and backup so we're retaining

328
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,160
backup

329
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,880
but we're replacing master with active

330
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,240
which seems to be very uh

331
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
a very natural choice

332
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,920
it seems like it's consistent with other

333
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,160
h high availability

334
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,000
protocols and things to have an active

335
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,680
and a backup

336
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
and at the same time since we're doing a

337
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,000
biz we're fixing all the errata

338
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
errata actually there wasn't that many i

339
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,360
fixed them

340
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,959
uh after

341
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,240
aditya did the initial uh changing of

342
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
all the uh terminology

343
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,240
and and and another thing now this time

344
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,120
we're hoping to get some good reviews i

345
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
don't i remember when

346
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,800
57 98 biz came through i didn't think we

347
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,600
got

348
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,360
i i reviewed it

349
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,519
really well but i don't know that we got

350
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,600
as many reviews as we should have

351
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
now we might investigate it taking it to

352
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,240
internet standard i don't know i think

353
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
i'm pretty sure since this is just

354
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
really a terminology change i'm sure we

355
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,360
can i'm hoping we can just leverage

356
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,600
interop testing that's been in the in

357
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
the past we'll start a thread on that

358
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,079
it's not a the last one isn't a isn't a

359
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,399
high priority it's just that if we can

360
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,519
do it as a byproduct of doing this biz

361
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,440
we'll do that as well

362
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,680
next slide

363
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,759
there's other rfcs there's also the vr

364
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,600
there's rfc 6527 which has the vrrp

365
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,720
version 3 miv now we don't have a film a

366
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
firm plan but uh

367
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
aditya says he's

368
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,079
interested in doing this so uh i think

369
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,839
he'll i i think he'll um

370
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,279
watch this space once we get this one

371
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,360
adopted for this

372
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,199
would you want to take questions now or

373
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,240
then

374
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
yeah i'll take them now

375
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,199
here

376
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,000
cair patel arcus hey ac quick question

377
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,800
um

378
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,399
it's great to see you replace the

379
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,800
terminology here um are you planning to

380
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,279
do the same with the yang model for this

381
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,480
protocol

382
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,680
oh

383
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,360
does it mean are you a plant in the

384
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,839
audience

385
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,040
i don't think so

386
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,240
it's the question

387
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,120
or the

388
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,759
the slide after the next one okay super

389
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,800
thanks

390
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,680
greg mirsky

391
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,839
the uh jumping um ahead of ac i just um

392
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,720
let you know uh i already uploaded their

393
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,839
updated

394
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,439
uh bfd and vrp document uh aligning with

395
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,160
the terminology and thank you and i

396
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,039
support this work

397
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,959
okay

398
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,760
oh oh the draft yes that draft

399
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,559
i

400
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,199
actually i did i didn't i didn't mention

401
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,280
any drafts in this presentation only

402
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,039
full rfcs because

403
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,240
i

404
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
just assumed if this gets accepted as a

405
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,000
working group document people will

406
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,039
update

407
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,280
the dra the inner working draft between

408
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,520
bfd and brp and any other drafts that

409
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,639
pertain to vrp

410
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
this one uh

411
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,679
uh f once once once we get this accepted

412
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,760
and maybe it goes through a reuse cycle

413
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,480
this is a very short draft rfc 90

414
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,360
7910 i'll contact

415
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,799
the offer

416
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,320
uh

417
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,480
jeffrey and i'm sure it wouldn't take

418
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,080
much to do a biz on this as well

419
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,960
it's an informational draft too and next

420
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,840
slide

421
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,120
yeah uh i'm a co-author of this draft

422
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,160
the yang model 8347

423
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,280
so

424
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,960
i plan once again once this one settles

425
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
a little bit you know at least gets

426
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,160
uh accepted as a working group document

427
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
and maybe i'll start i'll start work on

428
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
this one

429
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
we we know how to do both for the mibs

430
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,880
and the

431
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,520
and even the uh

432
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,760
even the yang models

433
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,320
it's a little painful but we know how to

434
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,720
do it we can deprecate i think we can

435
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
deprecate uh the old tables and and and

436
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,360
bring in the new tables

437
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,440
okay are you going to say something

438
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,080
yeah careful archus hey um

439
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
we we would support this work and as

440
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,600
soon as you change this uh we uh we'll

441
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,720
be more than happy to show

442
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,679
interoperability with um the new rfc as

443
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,360
well as the model okay

444
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
yes that that that's a that's a good

445
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,760
point you know like the mibs

446
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,559
whereas the code changes are pretty much

447
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,640
just cosmetic for the base protocol you

448
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,880
know the show commands or whatever

449
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,919
uh

450
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,039
the mib the mibs and the the mib and the

451
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,960
yang model will require

452
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,919
deprecation of old uh

453
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,880
old tables in the case of erp and old uh

454
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,840
yang nodes in the case of um

455
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,160
of the yang model we're gonna we

456
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,960
so we we plan to do that i know i know i

457
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,360
i did do some work i'm gonna it's gonna

458
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,520
take more investigation to see what the

459
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,640
least intrusive way to do this the good

460
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,559
news is i don't know of any up uh

461
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,039
implementations of of this draft i could

462
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,520
ask oh i could ask uh

463
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,080
the main offer who's shoe fan i'll ask

464
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,960
him if he knows of any and kiara's

465
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
showing finger so arcos has an

466
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,120
implementation

467
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,280
all of this as well okay okay

468
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
yeah i guess i guess i guess i should

469
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,880
that that the

470
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,600
second sub bulletin is wrong then

471
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,639
and the final slide

472
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
i think i think this is a good place for

473
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
it i think vrp since we don't have the

474
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,320
vrp working group and then we could

475
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,880
possibly discuss this terminology but

476
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,720
really

477
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,760
we've i think active is a natural choice

478
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
i know in things like this it kind of

479
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,640
gets in to be a naming con test and

480
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,960
people will put out a

481
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,480
suggestion

482
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,679
just for the sake of putting one out but

483
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
unless you have a real good reason to

484
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,880
choose something other than active uh

485
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,840
we really don't need any suggestions

486
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,120
and i'm requesting working group

487
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,760
adoption

488
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,400
uh chris

489
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,679
hey

490
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,480
hi ac um i was just gonna make a comment

491
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,559
about the yang i think

492
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,440
i

493
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,280
i think you'll be able to run them

494
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,520
together right so that it won't be it'll

495
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,760
be backward compatible right you could

496
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,679
you can have the old names and the new

497
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,919
names return the same data

498
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,159
yes yes a matter of fact we did

499
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,039
something with that with uh

500
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,480
with

501
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,360
i mean i i i'm not i know you're you're

502
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,720
up on all the tool kits and and other

503
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,799
things uh there's other people at my

504
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,799
company who do all that that that kind

505
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,960
of stuff but i remember we did the same

506
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,159
with when we did the ndma model for the

507
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,840
uh

508
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,559
the yang routing model

509
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,840

525
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,480
okay

526
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,000

527
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,440
be done back

528
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,799

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,360
that's what i mean you got it ying zhan

530
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,840
yeah

531
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,840
okay so uh we'll talk to our ad

532
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,919
with regards to

533
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,919
right place i think routing is the right

534
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,799
place to treat all vrp bus drives

535
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,120
but we need to confirm and ac thank you

536
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,799
for taking the work it's important to

537
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,760
use inclusive language

538
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,760
albert any comments or

539
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,799
sure alberto donald

540
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,400
so as long as we're here why don't we

541
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,440
ask

542
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,520
if there's interest

543
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,400
in the

544
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,799
room here and virtually of course

545
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,840
to take on this work

546
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,039
here um

547
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,799
i i believe it probably the this is the

548
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,240
right place right there there's no point

549
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,400
in uh spinning anything else up

550
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,600
so why don't we ask that and then we

551
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,120
make the decision of whether we do it

552
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,200
here or we do it somewhere else okay so

553
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,880
we'll take it to the list right

554
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,679
oh you wanna ask me right now yes

555
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,559
dear hockey working group do you think

556
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,640
routing is the right place to do

557
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,400
re-spins or erp beast drops

558
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,799
ham

559

some chat people are

562
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,639
agreeing with this

563
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,640
okay we have to create a poll

564
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,080
and then we can vote on that okay

565
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,600

the updates of apn next please

583
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,200
i will first go through the history of

584
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,360
the apn at ietf

585
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,840
it has been three years since we first

586
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,279
started the work

587
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,600
and thanks to the feedback we received

588
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,159
from the community and the guidance from

589
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,120
isd we have been progressing

590
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,720
after we proposed the framework in 104

591
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,840
and we held our first assad meeting and

592
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,640
we gathered our initial interest team

593
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,600
and we started exploring valuable use

594
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,480
cases and in 107

595
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,840
we applied for above for the first time

596
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,000
but it was rejected

597
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,720
and we were suggested that there were

598
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,480
similar attempts in the ietf history we

599
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,520
analyzed all the buffs in ietf

600
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,039
and we further clarified our scope and

601
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,360
published the new drafts

602
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,080
and further we held our second side

603
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,039
meeting

604
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,240
and we invited the people who were aware

605
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,000
of the history

606
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
and

607
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,960
also he gave us the advice on how to

608
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,279
progress the apn

609
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,520
and the further

610
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,480
we had our second above application it

611
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,799
was tentatively uh approved but not held

612
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,640
finally and we were suggested to

613
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,919
clarify the work in wider community

614
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,080
that's why we presented in the four

615
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,360
areas in one one one zero

616
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
and our third above application was

617
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,720
withdrawn

618
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,080
and we were suggested that a full apn

619
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,880
focus the interim meeting will be

620
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,600
arranged in rtgwg

621
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,399
thanks to this arrangement we were very

622
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,039
well prepared for our buff

623
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,000
and our fourth wolf was

624
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,320
approved and held

625
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,440
over 200 people attended this world

626
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,880
and from all the seven itf areas it

627
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,880
showed clear interest

628
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,000
and very active discussions we got a

629
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,039
clear

630
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,760
summary from the chairs and the guidance

631
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,279
from ad that is that we should publish

632
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,720
some solution drafts to show people what

633
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,520
are in my in our mind

634
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,559
and from the both we also got

635
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,919
some questions and we categorize them in

636
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,760
total 38

637
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,880
issues

638
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,720
and we systematically work on them and

639
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
address those issues

640
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,360
and based on that we clarify the drafts

641
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,760
and publish the new drafts and updates

642
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,600
the old ones

643
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,840
and uh

644
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,279

647
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,080

648
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,880
have

649
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,840
okay so we have uh presented the sixth

650
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,279
time in rtdwg and we had two set

651
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,679
meetings and four buff applications and

652
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,799
three hacksaws and currently we got over

653
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,120

660
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,679
yes so after the

661
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,000
apn buff we had received a lot of

662
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,279
feedback

663
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,760
from the buff and uh

664
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,559
we we've gone through and compiled a

665
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,880
list of 38 open issues from the buff and

666
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,240
through that we had gone through

667
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,760
systematically

668
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,159
and addressed every every one of the

669
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,880
issues that came up from the apn

670
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,399

671
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,240

immediately following the book uh adrian

673
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,240
had uh put together a nice summary of

674
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,320
you know feedback from the boss so just

675
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,279
compiling everything just the entire

676
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,440
um of what what it transpired through

677
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,520
the buff and and then going through it

678
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,679
and systematically closing out you know

679
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,640
all all outstanding issues so we made

680
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,039
here we do fuel and made you know some

681
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,000
really good progress um at lea you know

682
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,240
you know getting a grip on anything that

683
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,559
was outstanding and closing everything

684
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,000
out

685
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,159
this has all been documented on the

686
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,720
github link and it's it's in the top

687
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,880
right hand corner um if anyone's

688
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
interested in and looking at it that has

689
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,760
all the uh details of the uh

690
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,320
of the feedback feedback and closure of

691
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,439
all the issues next slide

692
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,720
so from the uh feedback and issues uh

693
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,840
there was two key draft updates uh from

694
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
the discussions that we had and one of

695
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,120
the key issues that came up through

696
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,919
the above was was related to

697
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,840
apn work and apn and and and related to

698
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,000
the limited trust domain

699
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,440
and and how that works so and a clear a

700
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,559
clarification

701
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,760
with that is related to apn is also ipn

702
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,200
is only applied

703
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,519
to an edge to edge tunnel encapsulation

704
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,799
within a limited domain so from a from a

705
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,279
apn head end to an ingress node to an

706
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,559
e-respe but it's encapsulated so as soon

707
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,360
as the packet hits the egress pe where

708
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,840
the de-encapsulation happens so from a

709
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,880
tunnel source to tunnel destination

710
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,600
at that time destination the uh

711
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,240
the apn header is removed and then the

712
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,080
pat and then the uh

713
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,720
native packet is exited so

714
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,399
any overlay technology mpls or srv6

715
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,760
where there is a where there's an

716
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,399
encapsulation that would be applicable

717
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,360
to apn uh you know it would within that

718
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,080
uh limited domain framework

719
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,000
the other question that came up uh

720
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
within the drafts and we it within the

721
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,880
uh

722
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,440
and when we've updated the drafts to uh

723
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,240
reflect as well as uh issues that were

724
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
closed out was related to uh an

725
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,399
encryption domain and security issues so

726
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,120
with that so with the apn attribute the

727
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
attribute is acquired based on existing

728
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,880
information in the packet such as a

729
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,799
five-top little q and q

730
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,480
um

731
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
provider and customer vln at the edge of

732
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,880
the apn network and then added added to

733
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,519
the data packet so the clarification

734
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,799
there was

735
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,519
related to an encryption domain and when

736
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,000
encryption you know is present so with

737
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,559
apn the attribute is acquired based on

738
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,399
existing information packet header and

739
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,960
then the clarification is the source and

740
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,880
destination address and the incoming

741
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,159
thereto or mpl's encapsulation incoming

742
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,720
physical or virtual port information or

743
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,039
the fields of the five tuple if they're

744
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,080
not encrypted so just other fields not

745
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,320
just the five tuple as there may be

746
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,960
fields within the fight within the

747
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,519
standard five tuple may may not be

748
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,919
readable may be encrypted so

749
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,000
the clarification related to that

750
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,320
related to an encryption domain

751
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,399
go on third question

752
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,840
lars go ahead

753
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,159
hi yeah alex i got either actually

754
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,919
reaction to the last slide where you

755
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,000
talked about the github issues because

756
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,440
it's been it's been a while but if i

757
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,120
remember correctly i raised an issue

758
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,799
that i thought was sort of pretty

759
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,399
fundamental and simple

760
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,519
namely

761
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,520
what happens if the application makes a

762
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,119
request that the network for whatever

763
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,280
reason can't satisfy and

764
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,760
the issue was closed

765
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,520
and because with the resolution to be

766
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,879
discussed

767
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,359
and um no discussion as far as i know

768
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,800
ever happened at this point i sort of

769
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,239
felt a little bit like um you know my

770
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,040
um

771
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,639
attempt to engage wasn't really being

772
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,040
taken seriously so i i stopped and i'm

773
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,639
hoping that wasn't the case for other

774
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,879
issues that were closed but personally i

775
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,399
sort of feel a little bit ambivalent

776
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,480
about describing that all issues were

777
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,760
addressed when

778
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,839
i feel mine at least wasn't thank you

779
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,079
thank you lord

780
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,079
you know after you know i've run through

781
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,639
this deck if um if there's any questions

782
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,719
i will have we'll have a brief period

783
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,199
that we can go through any questions uh

784
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,119
discussions related to any of the open

785
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,599
issues that may or may not have been

786
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,680
closed as you had mentioned so we would

787
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,440
like to we want to be open and address

788
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,839
any any outstanding or anything that

789
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,160
maybe may have been prematurely closed

790
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,920
we would like to you know be openly

791
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,119
addressed any any questions

792
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,359
thank you

793
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,839
you're breaking out

794
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,880
um please continue we will take it over

795
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,720
yeah okay

796
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,078
we can go to the next slide

797
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,359
okay

798
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,440
so we would like to ask the routing

799
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,520
working working group for adoption of

800
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,119
the framework related documents

801
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,359
at this point uh we feel we feel that

802
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,359
there is a lot of interest and support

803
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,320
for this work um

804
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,760
we think that in general the routing

805
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
architecture work you know

806
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,000
that we have with the framework document

807
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,640
is a good starting point um you know

808
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,520
that describes the the uh apn

809
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,800
architecture

810
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,280
and i think we you know we feel that we

811
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,079
are

812
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,680
at a good good point with the

813
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,560
development of this uh solution

814
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,760
uh

815
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,560
move forward with adoption

816
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,960
thank you

817
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,320
thank you gun so uh

818
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,720
this is the third update in routing and

819
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,680
uh in consultation with our ide we

820
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,640
strongly feel that

821
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,760
routing is not really a right place for

822
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,200
progress in this document so the options

823
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,760
are to create

824
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,599
another working group with very clear

825
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,119
milestones

826
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,280
and dates and how we proceed after

827
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,680
or proceed towards independent

828
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,359
submissions

829
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,079
so if alvaro wants to comment on any of

830
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,320
that

831
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,839
sure i guess i'll

832
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,200
comment um

833
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,079
so just to clarify um

834
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,440
the request

835
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,359
is for adoption of the framework and the

836
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,119
documents that are up there

837
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,560
not for the adoption of the solution

838
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,119
documents

839
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,480
so it was mentioned before in the slides

840
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,079
there so i don't know 10 plus documents

841
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,720
out there somewhere

842
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,359
so thinking about that

843
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,720
what that means is that

844
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,480
there were probably

845
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,400
if there is interest right you know

846
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,920
that's the first of course skating

847
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,040
question right if there's interest from

848
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,160
the community

849
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,839
to work on any of this

850
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,000
uh there will probably need to be

851
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,839
additional discussion

852
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,839
on what any solution would look like

853
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,920
beyond the framework which is one of the

854
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,640
reasons why we believe that if there is

855
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,640
interest i keep saying this because

856
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,160
that's the the really important part

857
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,359
it wouldn't be appropriate for the

858
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,520
routing working group to take that

859
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,599
on but it would be better to have a

860
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,680
focused discussion somewhere else

861
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,359
so i think we we should start there

862
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,000
right and see if there's questions here

863
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,839
i see yari standing in line somewhere

864
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,160
um and if there is interest for us to

865
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,880
continue the discussion on adoption

866
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,119
and if there is then we can figure out

867
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,160
um

868
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,400
what appropriate next steps would be

869
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
and where we can constrain some of the

870
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
discussions

871
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,760
thank you

872
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,359
thanks alvaro sounds great

873
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,280
so next step is for us to send email to

874
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,640
working group

875
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,720
oh

876
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,520
yeah go ahead

877
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,240
yeah sorry i didn't want to jump the

878
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,079
line i was just uh waiting for

879
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,720
opportunity so did you want to finish or

880
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,280
publish gossip

881
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,760
yes i just wanted to say that uh

882
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,599
in general i'm actually quite interested

883
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,320
in

884
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,119
in this application every networking

885
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,240
area uh in in in general that i'd like

886
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
to enable some collaboration between

887
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,920
applications and

888
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,079
and networks um

889
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,320
but unfortunately on this particular

890
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,440
topic or proposal we've had some

891
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,720
time passed by because like uh i guess

892
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,480
from my perspective we've been maybe a

893
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,079
little bit too

894
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,400
ambitious in terms of what we're trying

895
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,640
to achieve and that has courts caused

896
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,000
some

897
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,240
some issues if if i remember that the

898
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,400
latest buff conclusion there was

899
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,480
actually two major issues

900
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,400
issue number one was that

901
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,920
do we actually need new end caps and um

902
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,560
protocols to carry stuff or our existing

903
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,760
ones

904
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,480
sufficient so that that was one issue

905
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,560
the other issue was that

906
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,240
several members of the community felt

907
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,040
that

908
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,480
that if you have two general mechanisms

909
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,640
for carrying information

910
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
in in the package in this manner then

911
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,720
there's a danger that they'd be used for

912
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,800
you know highly granular

913
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,680
application or user identity or or

914
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,520
location identity or

915
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
some similar things so that might be

916
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,839
privacy wise um not great so i'm

917
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,079
a interested in uh like what was the

918
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,000
fate of these two issues and i'm sure

919
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,079
you haven't actually checked the

920
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,119
the

921
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,280
github repo but i will if you post a

922
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,839
link there somewhere

923
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,680
um the other comment that i had that we

924
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,800
um

925
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,119
separately have been writing some of us

926
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,240
uh uh tommy polly amelia

927
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,960
ted's a document on

928
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,119
in the iab about uh path signal

929
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,760
collaboration draft iab path signals

930
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,560
collaboration i think it is zero zero

931
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,520
and um that document tries to set out

932
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,280
some guidelines on when

933
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,839
like collaboration can can happen and

934
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,359
when it cannot

935
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,200
for for various reasons whether it's

936
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,119
privacy related or

937
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,800
whether it would you know somehow limit

938
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,560
the evolution of the network in the

939
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,440
future or would endanger some some issue

940
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,640
so

941
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,440
um

942
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,520
i'm not saying that our zero zero draft

943
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
has all the right ideas it probably

944
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,760
doesn't but it will be a useful exercise

945
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,560
to

946
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,200
take that and run it against the current

947
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,240
proposal that we have for apn and see

948
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,440
whether um all the

949
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,319
uh

950
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,119
uh suggestions are complied with or not

951
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,640
and and that could lead to either

952
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,480
changes in apn or changes in our

953
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,680
document i'd be happy to uh

954
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,359
work on that together with some some

955
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,119
other people if if you're interested

956
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,000
it'd be

957
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,599
nice to have a test case for for that

958
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,280
document as well

959
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,160
um

960
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,839
i i don't have a comment on this like i

961
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,599
don't think this framework sometimes i

962
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,440
think some of these high-level questions

963
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,480
are kind of

964
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,400
very high level that need to be decided

965
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,160
the approach needs to be decided before

966
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,720
you nail down the framework but

967
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,240
but i'm not going to comment otherwise

968
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
in that thank you

969
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,640
uh yeah the link to the repository has

970
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,480
been posted in the chat so you can use

971
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,680
it i will post my link to our document

972
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,560
also in a second

973
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,040
joel

974
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,599
i i expect mostly this will come out on

975
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,760
the list in the discussion but the

976
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,920
assumption that

977
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,160
this framework is the right place to

978
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,880
start on how do applications work with

979
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,319
the network

980
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,720
seems to be a false assumption and the

981
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,560
the improvements

982
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,720
from the addressing of the issues don't

983
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,040
really change that i do not i would love

984
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,599
to see us figure out a good way to get

985
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,200
applications to interact with and

986
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,440
request services from the network

987
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,040
no that is a valid thing that's

988
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,800
something we need it should take into

989
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,560
account the privacy stuff that yari and

990
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,319
company are working on and lots of other

991
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,000
things

992
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,400
but this framework is not the right

993
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,760
starting point it it assumes that the

994
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
problem is fundamentally a routing

995
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,880
problem

996
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,760
and

997
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,000
i don't at all think that is the place

998
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,640
the problem should even be starting

999
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,319
there have been more buffs than you can

1000
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,760
shake a stick at which basically

1001
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,240
concluded no this didn't make sense to

1002
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,359
work on

1003
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,000
the way it is being approached

1004
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,079
and so i think that the problem is more

1005
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,920
fundamental than

1006
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,720
just

1007
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,040
fixing this framework thank you i will

1008
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,359
thanks joe

1009
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,960
so uh we'll take to the list we'll send

1010
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,319
email to routing with cc

1011
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,880
apn and we'll take it from there then

1012
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,680
so the link to the repository posted

1013
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,440
please review whether your comments have

1014
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,280
been answered

1015
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,800
and

1016
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,680
we'll move to the next presenter

1017
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,079
so lynn

1018
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,400
you can see yes yep

1019
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,800
can you hear me

1020
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,480
yeah uh hello everyone uh

1021
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,560
this time uh uh we will uh update two uh

1022
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,520
old draft uh problem uh statement and

1023
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
the semantic address

1024
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,560
also we have uh two new drafts

1025
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,200
today i only give a little bit more

1026
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,839
discussion about third draft interactive

1027
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,640
instructive routing

1028
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,200
next slides please

1029
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,520
so here i just uh quickly go through uh

1030
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,400
our whole objective uh our objective is

1031
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,680
to uh explore open solution for layer

1032
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,880
three

1033
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,760
uh for large scale uh eru constellation

1034
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,079
for internet access and

1035
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,680
antenna integration

1036
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,839
nk integration is a requirement from

1037
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,759
3gpp for next-gen

1038
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,640
radio access

1039
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,240
and the satellite level is a huge and

1040
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,680
link is huge and also the isr is used

1041
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,440
not like a current

1042
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,240
space link a starlink

1043
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,400
and it provides global coverage and most

1044
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,240
importantly is a

1045
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,920
is following the regenerative mode in

1046
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,520
3gpp

1047
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,160
so most people ask me question which is

1048
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,599
transparent mode it only has a l1 uh

1049
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,560
work so we are not working for that part

1050
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,760
what we expect and what we do is we just

1051
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,920
try to provide basic iep technology for

1052
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,160
satellite network and

1053
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,720
we try to seek the feedback from working

1054
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,599
group

1055
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,560
and

1056
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,480
obviously this topic is pretty broad and

1057
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,480
this presentation cannot cover all

1058
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,200
solutions maybe more draft we are coming

1059
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,480
and

1060
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,400
we will not do anything regarding to

1061
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,680
3gpp relate to 3gpp next file space

1062
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,760
this is a review for the problem and we

1063
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,960
only have a little update for the draft

1064
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,000
and if you want to see more explanation

1065
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,960
here we have another set of slides more

1066
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,400
information there

1067
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,040
and in the slides we i answered most of

1068
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,520
the questions collected in the previous

1069
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,680
meeting and also in the

1070
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,400
ietf e2 set

1071
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,240
mail discussion

1072
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,440
and also i added the 3gpp engine run

1073
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,000
requirement of cellar network where the

1074
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,640
iep infrastructure is required to

1075
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,599
provide the connectivity

1076
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:56,400
uh

1077
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,760
also in the slides i have a simulation

1078
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,319
for mobility links and the path you can

1079
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,119
see how dynamic of the network

1080
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,560
looks like

1081
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,880
next slides

1082
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,079
here is the update for the semantic

1083
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,490
address and

1084
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,960
[Music]

1085
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,800
we only have uh

1086
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,599
add one section 32-bit cinematic address

1087
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,359
and

1088
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,440
this picture shows what is the address

1089
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,119
will be look like

1090
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,119
we have three indexes

1091
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,520
and you can either use it with in ipv6

1092
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,079
or using independently

1093
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,640
next slice please

1094
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,880
now we come to the new uh draft uh

1095
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,200
satellite interactive routing so the

1096
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,079
purpose is to provide a a

1097
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,720
rotting solution for satellite network

1098
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,119
why we need to do this because we have

1099
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,480
uh

1100
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,200
if we use igp or bgp we have uh

1101
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,119
following uh challenges

1102
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,240
uh link uh keep flipping and the link

1103
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,480
matrix keep changing

1104
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,319
then unsteady link also flipping

1105
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,480
also the possible link interruption at

1106
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,480
the polar area

1107
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,119
above the uh

1108
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,160
will cause huge igp protocol message

1109
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,800
flooding if we use igp of course

1110
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,640
there's only one protocol right now in

1111
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,520
industry to to do the advanced reporting

1112
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,680
so igp will face a lot of problem for

1113
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,440
this and will

1114
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,920
automatically reduce the service time

1115
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,559
next slide please

1116
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,520
this is a

1117
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,440
picture how the

1118
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,480
satellite network looks like it has two

1119
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,200
set of uh satellites moving to two

1120
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,880
different directions

1121
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,720
and uh we have a terminal uh connect to

1122
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,200
satellites uh

1123
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,839
connect with user also we have a

1124
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,920
terminal ground state a gateway ground

1125
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,839
station connect to internet also connect

1126
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,200
to satellites

1127
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,520
all these links are keep changing and

1128
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,720
the link metrics are also keep changing

1129
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,520
and the uh in addition to the

1130
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,359
mobility of satellites the ground

1131
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,160
station also keep moving because the uh

1132
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,800
has earth's rotation

1133
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,839
so next slice please

1134
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,040
so if we use igp for uh to provide

1135
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,319
ipconnectivity definitely we can do it

1136
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,319
but the problem is that huge number of

1137
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,160
links there and the link is keep

1138
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,599
changing so which will result in the uh

1139
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,400
service time dramatically reduced here

1140
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,119
we have formula uh some paper analysis

1141
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,079
that says only 20 less than 20 percent

1142
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,319
time will be service time all the time

1143
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,240
will be re in the convergence

1144
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,799
next slide

1145
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,800
so uh when we consider the solution we

1146
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,559
have to think about the what is the

1147
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,200
spatial characteristics of the satellite

1148
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,480
level

1149
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,640
first for satellite network according to

1150
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,200
3gpp it's just the kind of carrier

1151
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,400
network or the transport network

1152
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,359
so

1153
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,920
the only provided traffic transport

1154
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,640
traffic between satellites or

1155
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,000
between the ground station and

1156
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,599
satellites

1157
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,720
and the aerial constellation

1158
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,920
has very ordered topology even it's it's

1159
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,760
extremely dynamic

1160
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,160
so first of all it's a multi-layer grid

1161
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,720
network even interleaved and moving to

1162
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,240
different direction

1163
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,319
second is that its

1164
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,640
link number is limited

1165
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,520
about

1166
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,119
four to six

1167
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,040
and also the

1168
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,599
address as we are proposing the semantic

1169
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,640
address their addresses can be self

1170
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,000
explained

1171
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,839
so we can use that to identify

1172
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,440
satellites

1173
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,319
so the last is a satellite position is

1174
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,599
predictable

1175
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,200
because

1176
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,640
everything is

1177
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,280
following the physical laws and the if

1178
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,480
we know the

1179
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,440
orbital elements we can predict predict

1180
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,400
the

1181
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,359
adjacency and also predict the link

1182
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,440
matrix because the space

1183
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,160
environmentation is has much less

1184
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,119
interference like in our atmosphere

1185
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,760
next slides

1186
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,880
so here we have the uh principles for

1187
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,680
our hybrid solution first we want to

1188
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,440
make

1189
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,319
maximize the usage of the computation

1190
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,880
and in the routing to reduce the message

1191
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,240
so for example we can compute compute

1192
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,640
the network topology

1193
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,359
and the link metrics also predict which

1194
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,440
satellite can be can connect to which

1195
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,520
ground station

1196
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,920
second principle is that we won't borrow

1197
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,760
the igp

1198
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,599
for the satellite network topology and

1199
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,680
the state detection

1200
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,040
so uh

1201
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,839
one

1202
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,920
proposal is

1203
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,400
related to the ospf we can

1204
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,800
use the ospf to

1205
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,680
to

1206
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,920
maintain the link state

1207
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,760
uh third one is that we can

1208
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,559
utilize the semantic address uh for the

1209
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,160
routing purpose

1210
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,480
the last is that we want to minimize the

1211
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,960
routing overhead because if we directly

1212
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,000
use the ipv6 or second routine

1213
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,119
and we will see a huge number of the

1214
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,280
overhead so we want to reduce it that's

1215
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,280
the purpose of the last

1216
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,359
draft next slides

1217
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,160
so here i just quickly go through the

1218
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,160
how the interactive routing works it's

1219
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,400
very simple it's kind of a source

1220
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,079
routing basically we have a

1221
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,200
source to calculate the parts

1222
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,220
like this the

1223
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,359
[Music]

1224
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,040
from terminal ground station to

1225
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,359
destination ground station

1226
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,440
we are a couple of satellites

1227
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,680
then we can easily convert this to be a

1228
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,359
couple of segments

1229
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,920
and the segment is either on the same

1230
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,400
orbit or on the adjacent orbit

1231
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,119
and after com compressed to be uh

1232
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,280
segments we can convert to be

1233
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,680
instruction directly because the we have

1234
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,079
very limited number of the forwarding

1235
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,920
direction and also very limited number

1236
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,359
of the links

1237
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,240
so for example they we we define the

1238
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,839
instruction as a function and arguments

1239
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,640
we have a set of functions to guide the

1240
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,680
satellite

1241
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,040
falling to

1242
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,119
which direction actually we only have

1243
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,520
six direction measuring

1244
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,720
and then we check the arguments value to

1245
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,880
see if we reach the endpoint of the

1246
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,640
segments so finally we have very simple

1247
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,000
uh uh

1248
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,400
instruction list we can embed it in the

1249
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,200
packet next slide in one minute

1250
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,160
sure

1251
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,000
next slide

1252
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,200
so here we give the uh uh

1253
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,240
one uh user plan uh

1254
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,880
example which is a tunnel less we just

1255
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,680
use the introduced new routing type to

1256
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,760
embed the

1257
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,800
instruction to be packaged next slides

1258
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,040
yeah here is a summary of the

1259
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,040
interactive routing i don't go through

1260
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,960
each of them but compared with the

1261
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,280
current solution definitely we have

1262
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,480
we can see the advantages either in the

1263
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,000
lookup or the

1264
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,520
memory or the

1265
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,960
overhead size for the package also

1266
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,800
reduction for the isl link bandwidth

1267
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,720
that's all

1268
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,720
thank you any questions

1269
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,680
can just be a generic response

1270
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,119
uh you need to put yourself in the queue

1271
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,839
and then

1272
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:57,249
[Music]

1273
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:07,400
dance take it to the mic

1274
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,520
uh john go ahead

1275
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,760
um so this is is pretty interesting um

1276
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,359
but i have kind of a basic question i

1277
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,200
don't think has been addressed which is

1278
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,559
um

1279
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,160
is this a good candidate for

1280
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,160
standardization i mean to to my

1281
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,640
knowledge and this is not my field um

1282
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,000
these satellite constellations are um

1283
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,480
proprietary networks that are launched

1284
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,680
and managed by a single entity so

1285
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,520
um

1286
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,880
i'm not going to argue about the the

1287
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,720
value of the research i'm just wondering

1288
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,720
is this a thing that's a candidate for

1289
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,839
standardization thank

1290
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,520
you yes actually for that question i

1291
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,480
have uh

1292
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,040
some answer in my problem statements

1293
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,559
workshop uh why i can't

1294
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,559
need to do this i have listed some

1295
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,359
reasons yeah

1296
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,440
okay thank you i'll take a look

1297
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,480
so in general

1298
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,480
uh

1299
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,160
you're asking for significant amount of

1300
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,000
work that is

1301
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,400
large and requires either new routing

1302
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,000
protocol at least some changes to mana

1303
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,599
potentially

1304
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,520
uh what are your expectations there's

1305
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,000
significant number of drafts that are

1306
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,599
progressing kind of asynchronously

1307
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,680
what do you expect

1308
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,160
yeah we agree this is a pretty broad

1309
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,119
topic

1310
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,079
and

1311
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,920
right now there's no dedicated working

1312
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,240
group in the uh uh

1313
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,119
idf uh at this moment we just seek the

1314
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,599
comments from different

1315
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,119
to see what we can proceed

1316
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,799
okay thank you

1317
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,079
let's

1318
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,040
let's continue with next one

1319
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,200
uh there was question from

1320
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,440
engine the draft is informational is

1321
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,760
that intentionally or you plan to change

1322
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,520
the status eventually

1323
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,880
linseries still to you

1324
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,359
hello can you hear me

1325
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:34,079
yeah just give me one minute uh

1326
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,280
so if lynn comes up he can address it

1327
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,200
i see

1328
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,160
people uh positively reacting and asking

1329
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,040
to continue this work in uh itf it's

1330
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,440
still unclear where and when so

1331
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,440
we'll continue the discussion uh please

1332
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,480
go ahead insane

1333
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,359
okay

1334
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,799
hello everyone

1335
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,839
and i'm easton leo from channel mobile

1336
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,920
and today i will present the

1337
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,880
considerations for the protection of sr6

1338
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,400
networks

1339
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,839
next slide please

1340
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,839
and uh first we uh use the uh protection

1341
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:19,680
of sr6 network um by the sr6b and the

1342
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,680
battlefront first parts or

1343
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,319
t parts by using the policy

1344
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,079
and

1345
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,520
if we use the t parts we recommend the

1346
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,319
compressed segment list encoding

1347
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,040
and for the protection of the sr56

1348
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,480
network firstly is the parts protection

1349
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,799
including the local protection and the

1350
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,720
e2e protection

1351
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,720
and the secondly is the service

1352
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,160
protection

1353
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,040
also including the local protection

1354
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,920
protection and the third one is the

1355
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,079
coexistence of the service protection

1356
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,760
and the power protection

1357
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,160
and the third part uh

1358
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,720
i will introduce the running code status

1359
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,640
in the chain mobile

1360
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,440
and the fourth part i will give a very

1361
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,319
quick overview of further examples

1362
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:11,279
next slide please

1363
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,079
for the past protection and and the

1364
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,280
first is the

1365
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,839
local protection and definitely we use

1366
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:20,880
the

1367
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,680
tfa and and if

1368
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,720
if the

1369
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,720
compressed

1370
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,799
sr6 is enabled

1371
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,280
uh in the network i will recommend the

1372
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,960
gsr6

1373
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,599
the repair node should try to use the

1374
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,200
compressed seed

1375
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,920
to encode the tfa repair parts

1376
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,480
and to the e2e protection

1377
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,599
and

1378
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,480
the candidate parts with the second the

1379
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,880
highest

1380
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,079
preference

1381
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,200
uh can be selected as the backup parts

1382
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,319
and if all the candidate parts fail

1383
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:57,280
and

1384
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,040
we should use the

1385
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,280
be parts

1386
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,319
and for the limits check uh

1387
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,319
and for the local protection we can use

1388
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,119
the bfd for the interface or for between

1389
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,040
the neighbors for the

1390
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,000
policy or for the t parts and

1391
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,559
we can use the bfd for the policy

1392
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,440
next side please

1393
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,920
and for the service protection

1394
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,119
and

1395
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,520
it means that the egress pe deployed the

1396
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,880
same

1397
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,599
service like the vpn

1398
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,079
if the

1399
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,720
primary egress pe fails we can switch

1400
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,960
over to the backup pe

1401
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,119
and the for the local repair we can use

1402
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,640
the sr6 seagrass protection draft

1403
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,000
uh and

1404
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,640
with the mirror seat and

1405
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,520
for the e2e we can use the ingress node

1406
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,760
switchover and

1407
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,400
steals the full flow

1408
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,119
to the parts of the backup

1409
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,119
egress pe

1410
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:04,079
and the

1411
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,520
liftness check

1412
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,880
recommended

1413
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,760
use the vfd for the locator

1414
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,319
or the p address or

1415
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,920
for the specifically used

1416
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,480
service seat

1417
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,960
and the co instance

1418
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,880
of the service protection and the path

1419
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,280
protection we have

1420
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,799
two strategies

1421
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,480
and the first one is the egress note

1422
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,760
first and the second one is the t first

1423
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,640
next slide will uh show more clearly

1424
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,079
next step piece

1425
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,720
and for the strategy and

1426
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,720
for the primary and

1427
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,400
next hub we uh for the post of this

1428
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,200
strategy we use the

1429
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,160
te parts to the p2 and the primary

1430
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,599
egress pe

1431
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,400
and

1432
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,720
for the egress node first

1433
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,119
strategy

1434
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,119
one the primary next hub fails and

1435
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,920
we will switch over to the

1436
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,599
sr6be parts to the p2

1437
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,119
and the button for the t first strategy

1438
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,520
we will switch over to the

1439
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,319
te parts to the p3 and

1440
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,079
move move to a

1441
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,240
backup egress pe

1442
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,440
so

1443
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,079
that's a main difference of the two

1444
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,000
strategies it can

1445
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,039
meet the

1446
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,200
different requirements

1447
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,839
of the operator

1448
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,240
so next slide please

1449
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,119
okay

1450
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,640
this is the

1451
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,480
radical status in chat mobile we we have

1452
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,319
finished the

1453
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,480
lab interrupt test

1454
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,799
last year

1455
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:00,000
by using the gsi 6

1456
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,400
for the above protection solution

1457
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,240
by using the the

1458
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,960
controller from the channel unit tags

1459
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,400
and

1460
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,839
by the device

1461
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:15,280
from the huawei h3c and dte

1462
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,559
and also we have a finished child

1463
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,440
of the gfsix protection

1464
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,280
with above solution

1465
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,960
in three province branch networks

1466
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,280
last year

1467
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,920
next slide please

1468
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,839
uh the next uh several slides i will

1469
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,960
give a very quick uh overview uh for the

1470
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,640
examples

1471
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,839
next slide please

1472
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,200
firstly it's the

1473
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,400
sra 6be deployments and

1474
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,760
for this

1475
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,160
for this example

1476
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,880
we deploy the

1477
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,680
be parts to the p3 and p4 and the

1478
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,160
primary p and the backup pe

1479
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,119
and

1480
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,319
we

1481
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:09,280
also uh deploy the vfd for the locator

1482
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,280
of the both of the

1483
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,319
pes

1484
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,359
and

1485
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,920
odd nodes enable the tfa nexus type

1486
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,240
piece

1487
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:21,200
if the

1488
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,359
be parts failure

1489
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,440
just use the

1490
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,119
trva repair

1491
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,880
parts to

1492
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,039
protect the

1493
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,880
traffic

1494
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,839
next slide please

1495
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,640
and if the

1496
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,119
egress pe failed

1497
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,559
uh the p1 will check the switch over

1498
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,680
uh to the sra 6b be part to the backup p

1499
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,520
and the p4

1500
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,400
nexus please

1501
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:01,920
for the sms 6te diplomats is it is uh

1502
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,799
more complicated

1503
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:07,119
and for the

1504
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,559
uh to the uh

1505
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,400
primary exact pe

1506
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,640
we deployed

1507
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,520
uh

1508
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,400
one policy uh with the

1509
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,319
primary candidate parts and the backup

1510
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,319
penetrator pass with

1511
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:23,280
both both of the parts are the strict te

1512
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,240
parts

1513
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,039
and we recommend use the

1514
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,240
bfd

1515
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,119
uh

1516
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:30,240
with the

1517
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,680
forward parts

1518
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,119
and the

1519
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,000
rewards parts

1520
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,000
have the have the same parts

1521
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,880
in the back direction

1522
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,000
and we also deploy the

1523
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,359
be parts to the p3 for the

1524
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,599
primary egress pe

1525
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:52,799
and for the

1526
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,920
backup pe we deploy the

1527
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:01,119
loose te parts and also the rb parts

1528
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,919
next slide please

1529
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,440
uh for the

1530
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,559
for the policy to the egress p uh

1531
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,400
primary b class pe

1532
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,079
uh when the strict

1533
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,240
parts failure

1534
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,599
the p1 will check the switch over

1535
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,960
to the backup parts

1536
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,400
uh in the same policy

1537
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,520
next slide please

1538
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,440
if both of the other parts fails

1539
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,079
and the the p1 will check the

1540
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,119
the switch over of the first priority

1541
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,319
backup

1542
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:44,160
uh that is that means the sr6b

1543
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,480
parts to the p3

1544
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,440
because we use the egress node first

1545
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,559
strategy

1546
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:52,640
here

1547
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,240
if we use the t

1548
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,039
first strategy it will switch over

1549
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,240
uh

1550
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,400
to the uh p4

1551
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,400
policy yeah

1552
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,440
next slot please

1553
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,760
and if the

1554
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,559
primary egress p the p3

1555
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:13,680
fails

1556
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,960
and we the p1 will switch over to the uh

1557
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,319
e6t

1558
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:24,400
lose parts to the p4

1559
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,000
thanks does please

1560
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,680
minute

1561
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,960
okay okay i'll be quick uh

1562
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,039
for the for the loose parts failure uh

1563
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,960
if the

1564
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,720
if the failure happened to the to the uh

1565
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,200
long endpoint node

1566
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,559
we can use the trfa repair parts next

1567
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,799
please

1568
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,880
it will happen to the uh

1569
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,319
endpoint node we can use the switch over

1570
01:07:56,319 --> 01:08:00,319
to the be parts and then the desk or

1571
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:03,119
next last piece

1572
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,920
any questions and comments

1573
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,680
yeah we've got people lining up

1574
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,078
jeffrey

1575
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,839
jeff we cannot hear you

1576
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,520
sorry i'm fighting with echo jeffrey has

1577
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,600
how are you provisioning your bfd return

1578
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,920
path

1579
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:35,279
uh

1580
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,600
uh we we have

1581
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,520
uh provide

1582
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,479
a

1583
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:41,839
other draft

1584
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,158
for the for the parse uh

1585
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:45,600
consistency

1586
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,479
for the

1587
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:47,839
spfd

1588
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,920
in the vfd

1589
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,560
working group that you have the details

1590
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,080
is this the

1591
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,439
bfd directed

1592
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:58,960
draft

1593
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,399
yeah yeah yeah

1594
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,719
okay that was the answer thank you

1595
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,719
okay

1596
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,319
from juniper

1597
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,600
um i

1598
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,960
can't remember the slide where you

1599
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,799
showed the primary path and the backup

1600
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:13,600
path

1601
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,920
to a different egress e i think it was

1602
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,839
slide 14 but i might be mistaken

1603
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:23,600
so my question is uh maybe uh

1604
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,520
okay i'll assume p e4 is the um not sure

1605
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,080
here which is the primary in which was

1606
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,080
the backup

1607
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,359
my question is

1608
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:36,719
what happens if the cepe link on the

1609
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,880
primary egress uh fails

1610
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,560
that bfd um is my understanding is the

1611
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,600
session is towards the pe node egress p

1612
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,198
note and the egress p node is still

1613
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:51,359
alive

1614
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,000
so you won't be able to fall back to the

1615
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,520
backup

1616
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,360
candidate path

1617
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,400
uh the bfd session wouldn't tell you the

1618
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,679
fault in that case and

1619
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,880
in in in that sense why is this

1620
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,040
protection not done at the service level

1621
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,800
at the bgp level

1622
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,880
thank you

1623
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,360
okay thank you

1624
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,120
are you going to answer it or you prefer

1625
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,080
to send it to the list

1626
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,520
because i believe tara cast number of

1627
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,520
questions

1628
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,600
derek would you send your questions to

1629
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,239
the list please

1630
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,320
dark

presentation i'm really happy to hear an

1639
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,880
operator can share their real issues and

1640
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,360
considerations from the test and and

1641
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,080
deployment right it definitely can and

1642
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,440
help us

1643
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,199
uh on on how to develop the network in

1644
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:23,520
the future and guide us to uh uh

1645
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,239

i might have missed it but uh

1650
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,560
what's

1651
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,880
specific about srv6 here or what's

1652
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,640
what can not

1653
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,719
be done with sr mpos what's different

1654
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,480
uh i don't think we are going to get an

1655
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,920
answer could you please send it to the

1656
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,440
list i don't see any reactions here

1657
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,040
okay then we are moving to the next

1658
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,519
speaker

1659
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,960
so it's going to be bark braga instead

1660
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,320
of and just to say a few words

1661
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,480
uh we have discussions with transport

1662
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,640
area people on this draft

1663
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,960
it touches upon routing actually quite a

1664
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,640
lot and as many other presentations

1665
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,280
you've seen we are looking to

1666
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,520
ways where hosts can interact with the

1667
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,400
network so it's one of those

1668
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,840
please go ahead

1669
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,880
thank you jeff um can you hear me

1670
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,080
yeah

1671
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,120
excellent

1672
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,840
so yeah i'm gonna present hpcc plus plus

1673
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,000
here and this is an enhanced high

1674
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,159
precision congestion control

1675
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,480
uh suite

1676
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,239
work together

1677
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,960
with rui

1678
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,480
and and the team here presented on these

1679
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,040
drafts

1680
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,360
okay so um let's reiterate what are we

1681
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,600
trying to address here

1682
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,960
so

1683
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,800
we started with a

1684
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,080
focus on looking at cloud providers

1685
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,840
environments

1686
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,679
and there are a couple of things that

1687
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,320
happen in the recent years

1688
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,280
that

1689
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,600
drove our interest

1690
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,960
starting with the high performance

1691
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,120
storage

1692
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,199
and the change in the storage

1693
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:40,239
environment recently

1694
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,640
drove a much higher throughput and lower

1695
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,760
latency

1696
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,080
access to the storage

1697
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,600
and we see

1698
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,120
order of magnitude of million iops and

1699
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,239
about 50 to 100 microsecond response

1700
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:55,440
time

1701
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,320
and this is a kind of uh

1702
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,040
go

1703
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,360
order of magnitude uh less than what it

1704
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,480
used to be

1705
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,400
before ssds and energy uh were

1706
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,520
introduced to the networks

1707
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,159
uh another angle is a high performance

1708
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:15,199
computation or hpc

1709
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,880
with the rise of distributed deep

1710
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,800
learning

1711
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,239
with the move

1712
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,400
to having a more

1713
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,719
kind of heavy loaded

1714
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:26,840
applications on the network the use of

1715
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,480
gpus to drove much more

1716
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,320
bandwidth in traffic towards the network

1717
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,719
fpgas and asics

1718
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:37,040
all these shifts put a lot of pressure

1719
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,560
in the network

1720
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,560
because the compute become much more

1721
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,040
capable and much more demanding

1722
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,280
in terms of the communication patterns

1723
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,159
in between these devices

1724
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:50,560
as well as lower latency because

1725
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,800
because the computation is distributed

1726
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,800
there is a lot of dependencies

1727
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,800
between the various nodes

1728
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,520
um and this dwarf latency even further

1729
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,640
down

1730
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,840
towards sub 10 microsecond requirements

1731
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,400
and even below that

1732
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,400
in addition to that resource or memory

1733
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,239
disaggregation in the network so their

1734
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,600
servers

1735
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,000
kind of architectural changes and how we

1736
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,199
built

1737
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:18,719
the servers or the compute elements

1738
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,640
basically because we disaggregate all

1739
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,840
these components used to be in the

1740
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,400
same

1741
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,199
same box or chassis if you will now when

1742
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:29,360
we dislocate them we

1743
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,719
present latency from the network

1744
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:33,600
and

1745
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,719
in order to overcome it we need to

1746
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,320
give services that are even lower

1747
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,960
latencies

1748
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,760
than what we already discussed so all of

1749
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,080
these kind of drove us

1750
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,360
towards looking into solutions to enable

1751
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,440
higher bandwidth consistent bandwidths

1752
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,600
and lower latency as well as consistent

1753
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,280
latency

1754
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,640
grad

1755
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,880
yes

1756
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:08,480
a couple questions so uh first um

1757
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,600
um there have been uh comments uh the

1758
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,920
draft before the meeting

1759
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,870
and uh i just wonder if uh offers uh

1760
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,040
[Music]

1761
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,840
notice them

1762
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,040
yes i think we will dress it probably at

1763
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,800
the end of this deck

1764
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:32,080
okay uh another question is um that's

1765
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,400
something that uh i think that i didn't

1766
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,040
ask um in my comments

1767
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,960
uh is it related to what what greg is is

1768
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,880
it related to what was already presented

1769
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,120
now or is it more general

1770
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,880
ah moon okay i'll wait then thank you

1771
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,400
okay

1772
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,960
thank you great

1773
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,159
okay next slides please

1774
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,679
all right so if we kind of take a

1775
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,080
deeper look um

1776
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,840
these were the applications but now when

1777
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,640
we look on how the network is actually

1778
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,560
or the whole study is actually

1779
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,120
serving these applications

1780
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,920
then what we see is that

1781
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,199
hyperspeed networks networks

1782
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,199
chips actually form hyper speed

1783
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,320
networking

1784
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,840
what does it mean we talked about the

1785
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,679
application again but now

1786
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,440
not only that the application has been

1787
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,400
changed but also the hosts or the nic if

1788
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,600
you will

1789
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,159
has been changed and we see more and

1790
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,120
more

1791
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,679
uh demand and installations of hardware

1792
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,000
awful being in the nick

1793
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,159
so if you look kind of on the history in

1794
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,320
the past

1795
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,880
and especially considering tcp and the

1796
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,400
like

1797
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,679
what we have seen is some offloading

1798
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,360
mostly related to

1799
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,120
things has to do with hashing and so on

1800
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,000
a little bit um handling uh you know the

1801
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,320
messages and cut them into pockets and

1802
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,520
so on

1803
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,800
but uh a fundamental change happened um

1804
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,960
with uh harder offloading

1805
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,719
uh that has to do with rdma or remote

1806
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,199
direct memory access

1807
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,760
that means that a lot of the transport

1808
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,080
actually is being offloaded

1809
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,679
into hardware so no need to go into cpu

1810
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,199
and software anymore in order to handle

1811
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,840
networking

1812
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,320
and this cause

1813
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,520
kind of

1814
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,600
audio of magnitude

1815
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,760
jump in latency and bandwidths

1816
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,679
in the network

1817
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,480
in order to be able to keep up

1818
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,159
with these demands

1819
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,840
this is why we were looking into

1820
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,159
real-time conjunction control because

1821
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,080
there is a lot of data and communication

1822
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,000
running in the network meaning more

1823
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
pressure on the network

1824
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,159
and it becomes harder and harder for the

1825
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,800
network to be able to serve

1826
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,159
these requirements coming from the

1827
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:03,840
servers

1828
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,400
next slide please

1829
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,800
um so

1830
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,040
what are the challenges that related to

1831
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,600
condition control in high-speed networks

1832
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,520
that we discussed

1833
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,400
um convergence upon congestion so

1834
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,360
if condition happens in the network

1835
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,960
then how

1836
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,239
fast

1837
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,080
would the network be able to solve this

1838
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,600
congestion

1839
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,640
and and and basically reduce the load in

1840
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,000
order to be

1841
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,679
able to

1842
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,080
prevent the condition

1843
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,239
and also how fast

1844
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,080
will it be able to

1845
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,040
pick up

1846
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,840
one's congestion result

1847
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,280
so these two

1848
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,280
challenges

1849
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,600
we try to address

1850
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,199
running multiple applications over

1851
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,040
converged networks so as you're well

1852
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,000
aware

1853
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,800
these cloud environments that we began

1854
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,840
with and

1855
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,280
later on thought about other use cases

1856
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,159
they may run multiple applications um

1857
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,040
and uh the the requirement is to be able

1858
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,000
to

1859
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,480
uh not have dependency between them

1860
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,719
and this is why costs and buffering your

1861
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:17,280
scholars resources uh in the network as

1862
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,679
you're well aware

1863
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:23,040
in addition because uh current um

1864
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,280
conditional algorithms

1865
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,920
whether using ucl or not um

1866
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,560
has a lot to do with many parameter

1867
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,840
tuning

1868
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,440
it has to do with the fact that the

1869
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,560
visibility into the network is limited

1870
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,679
and then

1871
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,000
some kind of heuristics has to be to be

1872
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,679
made

1873
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:44,480
next slide please

1874
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:50,080
here i will uh kind of present um

1875
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,080
i should say an opportunity

1876
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,520
that has to do with uh the uh evolving

1877
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,639
uh telemetry capabilities in the network

1878
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,639
so when we're looking into uh invent

1879
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,400
telemetry um

1880
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,760
or uh

1881
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,360
and when i say invent elementary and

1882
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,679
maybe this is at least partly

1883
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,920
address uh some of greg's

1884
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,280
questions

1885
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,719
uh we refer to that as the capability of

1886
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:16,239
embedding

1887
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:17,840
a telemetry

1888
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,639
on

1889
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:21,360
an in-flight packet as it drives student

1890
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,520
the network

1891
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,320
what we see in recent years is that new

1892
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,159
networking asics that are coming to the

1893
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:29,440
market

1894
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,719
have these type of capabilities

1895
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,520
and they are already deployed

1896
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,960
in the in the today's cloud and networks

1897
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,320
as i mentioned packets can collect

1898
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,519
elementary on their route

1899
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:47,360
and in terms of

1900
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,800
standardizing

1901
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,719
these

1902
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,320
capabilities

1903
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,159
we see efforts

1904
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,040
in couple of places um

1905
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,960
one of them that might be most relevant

1906
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,600
here in this phone is the itf

1907
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,880
uh iom specification which is being

1908
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,719
worked on in as part of ippm

1909
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,360
which standardizes basically the data

1910
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,560
structures

1911
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:17,440
uh to enable uh these capabilities

1912
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,840
uh there is a work uh under uh p4.org

1913
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,639
um that's called int

1914
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:28,159
and there is a graph suggestion uh uh

1915
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,719
under the name of ifa that was suggested

1916
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,320
for ippm that

1917
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,480
is not progressing as a

1918
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,880
as a working group after this stage

1919
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,480
one minute

1920
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,199
next slide please

1921
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,679
so can we use this new tool um as a

1922
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:49,199
precise feedback for congest control

1923
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,040
potentially yes and this is what we were

1924
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,960
looking at

1925
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,679
based on very precise visibility into

1926
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,360
the network

1927
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,480
sender

1928
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,960
and hosts in general can adjust the rate

1929
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,120
potentially they can adjust also the way

1930
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:03,920
the

1931
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,920
of the routes that the packet may take

1932
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,440
in the network uh based on uh this uh

1933
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,880
feedback

1934
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,679
next slide please

1935
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,360
so um there are a couple of formats as i

1936
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,280
mentioned because of time i won't get

1937
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,840
into too many details but we are not

1938
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,600
asking to discuss the format of the

1939
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,840
packets here just the requirements

1940
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,080
from the inventory

1941
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,760
specifications to be able to support

1942
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,440
data that is needed from the network for

1943
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,080
this purpose

1944
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,639
slide please

1945
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,199
so we address uh all the challenges that

1946
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:41,600
we discussed uh fast convergence so we

1947
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,320
have a good visibility for the senders

1948
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,320
near zero kills we do not need to rely

1949
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,800
on q build up anymore

1950
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,600
and way less parameters to configure

1951
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,520
because of again this precise feedback

1952
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,960
that we get from the network and we can

1953
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,639
take better decisions

1954
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,600
from congestion and routing perspectives

1955
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,960
next slide please

1956
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,440
so how do we see what hpc plus plus is

1957
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,520
and this is related to uh

1958
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,239
jeff comment at the very beginning the

1959
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,920
way we see it is this is basically a

1960
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,320
service it comes to serve

1961
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,639
the networking

1962
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,159
entities whether

1963
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,400
it is transport or wiring engine

1964
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,159
but based on this data that is being

1965
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:25,040
built in the endpoints we can take

1966
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,560
better decisions

1967
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,280
and serve the applications better

1968
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,199
and this is why

1969
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,159
you know

1970
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:33,760
when we came to discuss also with some

1971
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,080
of the transport teams because it is

1972
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,960
transport agnostic

1973
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,560
basically

1974
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,600
then

1975
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,520
there is no specific transporter details

1976
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,480
to

1977
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,440
and

1978
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,760
it is also routing

1979
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,760
a protocol agnostic it's basically a

1980
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,760
service that can be used

1981
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,159
by different entities in the network

1982
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:57,638
next slide please

1983
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,840
and uh we will be more than glad to get

1984
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,280
the uh working group feedback um

1985
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,239
uh on the details and on how to proceed

1986
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,000
thank you

1987
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,360
so as i said there's an ongoing

1988
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,239
discussion with transport area

1989
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:15,440
ads

1990
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,280
and uh we'll keep you updated what's

1991
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,800
going on here

1992
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:23,440
and we've got uh david black

1993
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,840
oh lars he has more dots

1994
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,400
excuse me

1995
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,759
please let laras go before me

1996
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,159
hi laura sagar speaking as an individual

1997
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,719
with no dots so um

1998
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:39,760
i think this is certainly interesting

1999
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,760
for transport and i think the congestion

2000
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,280
control part of this would certainly

2001
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,120
need to be standardized there and there

2002
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,360
are like ways in which we do that

2003
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,800
i'm sort of

2004
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,960
the interesting question for me

2005
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,040
in routing is whether switches and

2006
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,880
routers would be willing to provide this

2007
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,000
information it's good to see that

2008
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,600
there's already some

2009
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,840
vendors that do so and i think the

2010
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,560
the the problem for this sort of network

2011
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,239
based congestion control was always that

2012
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:05,760
we couldn't get the information we the

2013
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,840
transport couldn't get the information

2014
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,159
from the from switch fabric like ecn for

2015
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:12,000
example right never really took off

2016
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,480
because we just didn't get the bits

2017
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,719
so if this has no change and there's the

2018
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,880
ability the possibility to get this

2019
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,159
information from the network that would

2020
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,159
be great because it opens up all kinds

2021
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,719
of things like hpcc and others and i

2022
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,239
think for routing the discussion would

2023
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,080
be you know is this something that has

2024
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,760
changed on the routing side where the

2025
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,800
network would be willing to offer this

2026
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,440
thank you and that's exactly it

2027
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,440
we are finally getting to the point in

2028
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,360
time where nothing requiring can

2029
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,360
actually communicate back what it does

2030
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,840
so and again the question

2031
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,360
where it should leave

2032
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:52,000
really stays open and uh ongoing but

2033
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,400
this work is kind of really important

2034
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,199
the amount of rdma traffic in large data

2035
01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:59,840
centers is going up exponentially

2036
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,600
they absolutely need

2037
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,679
to keep routing simple so using today's

2038
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:06,960
bgp css sharespace routing they need

2039
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,800
better congestion control to be able to

2040
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,320
change entropy to reduce transmit rate

2041
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,159
and this is really work that's going

2042
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,239
this direction when host can interact

2043
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:18,159
with the network and do something useful

2044
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:19,920
with it dean

2045
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,480
it'd be cool dear mogranovich

2046
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,600
so

2047
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,280
here's i have a

2048
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,679
concern that with the speeds that we are

2049
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:30,639
approaching and the latency that is

2050
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,560
you know that we are seeing we are

2051
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,000
hitting that

2052
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,800
information by the time it arrives being

2053
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,800
computes and being propagated back to

2054
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,000
the source

2055
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
might be already old

2056
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,960
so we have to if this really wants to

2057
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,920
work i think we should consider

2058
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,440
that we have to put in a pole mechanism

2059
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,600
like a like because today we do all the

2060
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,520
routing on the push mechanism that we

2061
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,960
should also do a routing based on the

2062
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,800
pulling mechanism in order to try to

2063
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,960
avoid the congestion con to

2064
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,639
to find the solution for congestion

2065
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,199
control very good comment and please do

2066
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:07,440
send your comments to the list

2067
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,120
and i believe authors would be more than

2068
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,199
happy to address them and we have to

2069
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:12,320
move

2070
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:16,320
to the next presentation thank you

2071
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,320
thanks barack

2072
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:37,760
good trying to use the new tool just a

2073
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,280
little bit getting a bit used to

2074
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,040
um this is a

2075
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,280
a draft that comes out of research we've

2076
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,000
done

2077
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,719
on dlts and provider networks we try to

2078
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:50,800
better understand what dlts as a

2079
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,800
technology is doing to

2080
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,159
networks and we thought sharing the

2081
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:56,000
insights here with the routing working

2082
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,840
group may be quite useful because we're

2083
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,679
seeking input as well

2084
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:02,000
um

2085
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:03,920
i'm trying to see how okay now it

2086
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,639
finally comes sorry took a bit so

2087
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:09,360
the war games to understand how um

2088
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,960
what's the impact of dlts if you run

2089
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,639
dlts it doesn't question why we're using

2090
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,400
dlts we're taking any dlt application

2091
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,440
there is

2092
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,440
but what happens to your network

2093
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,280
when you have dlts running on top and

2094
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,040
and the footnote here is quite important

2095
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,880
we started our insights they were all

2096
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,280
experimental we started them based on

2097
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,280
proof of work based dlts ethereum at the

2098
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,960
beginning and we're still that's one of

2099
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,080
the pieces that we're looking at other

2100
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,679
dlts as well

2101
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,840
we want to engage and we took this work

2102
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,280
first and we took it actually into the

2103
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,840
iic there's an ic white paper on the the

2104
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,920
industrial iot consortium

2105
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,840
you can read the white paper link is in

2106
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:42,960
the

2107
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,480
is in the draft and we wanted to turn

2108
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,840
this into a living document we want to

2109
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,760
get more insights in particular from

2110
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,679
from folks who understand routing

2111
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,199
um quite well

2112
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:52,480
so you want to want to engage with the

2113
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,000
community

2114
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,480
and and both want to extend on the

2115
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,120
impacts as well as on the opportunities

2116
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,520
to maybe mitigate some of the impacts

2117
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,520
so we have a structure you can see here

2118
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,000
where we we talk about dlt concepts so

2119
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,040
that's a little bit to understand how

2120
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,600
dlts work i'm not going to go into this

2121
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,600
a bit about the communication in a dlt

2122
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,360
so what does the dlt really do in terms

2123
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,280
of communication to your network

2124
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,520
um some of the challenges we're seeing

2125
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,040
as well as the experimental insights

2126
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,120
that we currently have as well as some

2127
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,239
of the opportunities for network

2128
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:24,560
innovations that we also see moving

2129
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,040
along that may may help us there

2130
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,040
so what's the typical communication in a

2131
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,719
dlt for those of you who

2132
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,320
who are maybe not that familiar with the

2133
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,560
dlt really does the dlc is a form for a

2134
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,040
distributed consensus consensus system

2135
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,719
and we have a client that commits a

2136
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:41,280
transaction request to the dlt

2137
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,920
a miner or a peer generally we call them

2138
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,080
peer largely in the draft more commonly

2139
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,840
known are miners for instance for proof

2140
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,440
of work dlts

2141
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,520
commit a found block to the dlt as a

2142
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,080
piece of the system of the ledger and

2143
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,560
any client or another miner may read the

2144
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,400
blockchain from the dlt that's kind of

2145
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,239
like the typical communication pattern

2146
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:03,120
or the interactions you see in a dlt

2147
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,520
in all of this it's important that these

2148
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,080
operations are inherently multi-point

2149
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,679
and the nature of that multi-point is

2150
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:11,360
something we in particular investigate

2151
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,280
with quite some interest because that's

2152
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,120
one of the biggest issues in the dlt

2153
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,199
we've seen

2154
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:19,040
the communication pencil how do you

2155
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,120
translate this um the the key aspect

2156
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,040
that's being used

2157
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,639
in the um

2158
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:26,719
in the dlts is the so-called pool of

2159
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:28,960
peers to talk to so the

2160
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,600
appears you're communicating the um

2161
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,280
request the dlt

2162
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,520
information to and this is a very very

2163
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,120
simple um

2164
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,719
flowchart um i see there's something

2165
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,239
going wrong in the flowchart in one of

2166
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:43,440
the return paths apologies for that you

2167
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,440
find another picture in the draft

2168
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,600
so it works off a list of dlt pieces

2169
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,960
which is being distributed through the

2170
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,639
network and these dlt peers are usually

2171
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:53,920
described as ip addresses ports and

2172
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,159
and with the ports the protocols you you

2173
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,880
you're maintaining it does no discovery

2174
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,199
so it builds a list of peers that it

2175
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,760
understands it could communicate with

2176
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,239
and then it picks randomly from those

2177
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,480
peers a number of notes to communicate

2178
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,639
with transport security is trying to

2179
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:11,679
establish

2180
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,920
a capability exchange that's um

2181
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,000
pertaining to particular protocol

2182
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,040
aspects security aspects you may need to

2183
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,040
support but also hyper capabilities do

2184
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,960
you have a gpu for instance if you do a

2185
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,360
proof of work dlts

2186
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,719
on the left hand side you see the

2187
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:29,120
incoming peers you may also be contacted

2188
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,199
by an incoming peer who does the same

2189
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,120
thing on their side so there's a lot of

2190
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,760
chatty communication happening

2191
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,320
and in the end a successful peer is

2192
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,880
being added to the so-called pool of dlt

2193
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,800
peers by configuration to give you an

2194
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:43,840
idea

2195
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,880
in ethereum these are by default 50

2196
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,280
peers you're communicating with

2197
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,679
these 50 peers keep changing over time

2198
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,440
so if you think 50 is a relatively small

2199
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,719
number when you run the numbers and

2200
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,000
trying to understand how much in a

2201
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,280
certain amount of time you're actually

2202
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,400
talking to

2203
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,719
you end up at thousands

2204
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:03,120
because the pool of dltps keeps being

2205
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,920
randomized over time and there's they

2206
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,760
all go through this mechanism of node

2207
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:08,880
discovery

2208
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,040
you do a type of tls type of transport

2209
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,199
security capability exchange

2210
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:14,639
and up to the pool you're being

2211
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,400
evacuated from the pool after some time

2212
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,480
etc etc etc

2213
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,440
and that's

2214
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,040
kind of one of the biggest things that's

2215
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,840
happening in the dltps now my buttons

2216
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,719
disappeared okay there you are

2217
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,000
while you're doing there's a question

2218
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,159
whether the pool is bounded

2219
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:30,880
um

2220
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,000
it's configuration it's all

2221
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,239
configuration 50 it is in the beginning

2222
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:36,239
by default configuration you can set

2223
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:38,480
this larger but um we run it in the

2224
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,560
default configuration for ethereum

2225
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,520
thanks

2226
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,199
so the problem is the the one thing is

2227
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,880
you you require information to reach

2228
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,480
other peers um

2229
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,960
in dlts like ethereum you have bootstrap

2230
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,360
notes so you sign up to the dlt you give

2231
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,120
up your ip address the bootstrap note

2232
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,280
seat the actual node discovery it

2233
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,960
maintains the ip addresses of all the

2234
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,719
miners plus the port information so

2235
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:00,320
you're also indicating whether you have

2236
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,719
support for udp tcp

2237
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,480
the new dlt members as you saw in the

2238
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,920
previous slide they need to discover and

2239
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,320
maintain these addresses all the time

2240
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,600
upon joining and they are being

2241
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,199
refreshed as i mentioned several

2242
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:12,560
thousands

2243
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,560
also clients don't know anything about

2244
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,159
the capabilities so i go through this

2245
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,159
whole thing about a contact a potential

2246
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:19,679
miner i have an ip address i go to the

2247
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:20,880
ip address

2248
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,480
i wait for the connection and you notice

2249
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,840
the waiting for the connect is very bad

2250
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,199
if the ip address isn't actually

2251
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:26,800
reachable because you have a timeout so

2252
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,159
you're just waiting 30 seconds for

2253
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:29,120
nothing

2254
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,199
you inquire the capabilities and any

2255
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,040
disconnect if they are not matching

2256
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,719
and again if you run this actually in an

2257
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,080
experimental setup you'll notice there

2258
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,679
are a lot of disconnects just simply

2259
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,520
because folks are not meant to talk to

2260
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,560
each other

2261
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:41,679
right a lot of these thousands of

2262
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:43,520
connections are actually

2263
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,760
unsuccessful connections

2264
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,480
so miners may never reply

2265
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,080
finally if you have the pool then

2266
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,000
obviously you end up mapping

2267
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,320
the sending of transactions onto unicast

2268
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,800
communication right so that negatively

2269
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,159
impacts efficiency because you do

2270
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,639
unicast replications like in in many

2271
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,080
overlays

2272
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,000
and it also impacts the completion time

2273
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,520
because you have to keep doing this as a

2274
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,239
replication rather than a multicast

2275
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:10,719
the the last problem that we outlined is

2276
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:13,280
that you need to expose the ip address

2277
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,679
that's never a very very good idea in

2278
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,239
particular if you if you look at the

2279
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,560
idea behind the dlt and that is

2280
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,320
communication between possibly

2281
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,800
inherently untrusted parties well hang

2282
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,080
on a second why am i giving my ip

2283
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,800
address to these people right i mean i'm

2284
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,560
not trusting them even on the ledger

2285
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,840
information but i'm trusting them with

2286
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,360
my ip information

2287
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,800
so you set an ip

2288
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,159
address it leads to privacy issues

2289
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:38,000
security issues

2290
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:38,880
um

2291
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,320
it's difficult to handle ip atlas

2292
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,320
changes because they have to propagate

2293
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,400
from the bootstraps into the miners if

2294
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,920
you change your ip address you may still

2295
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,520
have and this is also happening quite a

2296
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,080
bit in the discovery process

2297
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,400
the uh you're actually contacting ip

2298
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,760
addresses they're all they're already

2299
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,080
outdated and you notice this by waiting

2300
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,239
30 seconds right nothing's happening

2301
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,320
supporting mobility is another issue

2302
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,799
obviously

2303
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,679
so there's always a slight lag in this

2304
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:07,840
one the experimental insights there at

2305
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,679
the moment taken from the irc white

2306
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:11,360
paper we're also already working on

2307
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,800
newer ones that we will put in another

2308
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,159
update there they're constantly coming

2309
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,400
in with running the experiments as they

2310
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,080
the days go by

2311
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,000
the different types of their dlts as you

2312
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,520
can imagine from the from the pool

2313
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,239
before from the chart there's so a

2314
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,080
fairly large number that such is simply

2315
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,320
not reachable there the ip address is in

2316
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,679
the bootstrap node

2317
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:32,000
good luck you try to reach them the ping

2318
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,360
never comes back

2319
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,280
they may just signal we call them just

2320
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,199
signaling because you're going through

2321
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:38,560
the capability exchange and nothing is

2322
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,080
really happening you have mismatching

2323
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,440
capabilities

2324
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:42,880
but you also may end up in the end

2325
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,000
talking to

2326
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,920
an actual node after capability exchange

2327
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,280
but they're sending you useless data

2328
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,719
uses data

2329
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:50,239
the data you start with at the very

2330
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:51,600
beginning is the blockchain you want to

2331
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,520
synchronize on the latest blockchain but

2332
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:54,800
you may never end up with actually

2333
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,119
getting any useful data from them

2334
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:58,800
last but not least you actually have

2335
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,040
miners you finally talk to usefully so

2336
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,199
that's the last type we identified and

2337
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:08,159
only 16 of the nodes are actually useful

2338
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:10,080
the rest is rubbish

2339
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,639
and depending on what stage you fail it

2340
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:14,400
is big robby small rubbish that it

2341
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,719
depends right 42 percent of the traffic

2342
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,639
is wasted we found this out so far and

2343
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:20,320
we're refining the data at the moment to

2344
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,199
split

2345
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,600
where the waste actually does happen

2346
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,760
um i said we have the additional kpis

2347
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,840
that we will put into an update after

2348
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,159
113.

2349
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:31,840
so what are network innovations we're

2350
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,840
outlining this in section seven and

2351
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,199
section eight and we're just starting

2352
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:36,639
there and we're also reaching out in

2353
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:38,239
some of the research space and eight

2354
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:39,679
finn is going to talk about one of these

2355
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:40,960
things

2356
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,199
two presentations after this one

2357
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,119
so references to ongoing traffic we have

2358
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:46,719
there there's some opportunities that

2359
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:49,679
we're looking into in multicast there's

2360
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:51,600
a whole discussion around why is it you

2361
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,000
can't really quite use multicast if you

2362
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,320
look at the random nature of these pools

2363
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,239
you might guess why that's the reason

2364
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,960
it's extremely dynamic multicast

2365
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,400
we also link in the standardization

2366
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,800
efforts in the ieee dlt

2367
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,880
work that's ideal to interrupt work

2368
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,400
that's been done in a couple of site

2369
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,880
meetings the semantic routing that

2370
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:13,440
adrian's going to talk about later dynrg

2371
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,520
and we want more input there so what are

2372
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,520
we we're having a

2373
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,520
going to the last not quite the last on

2374
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,960
the last slide you see a side meeting

2375
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,080
that's happening tomorrow where we

2376
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,320
actually do talk a bit more about this

2377
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,840
so what's next

2378
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,480
we want to extend our work more to

2379
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,480
understand more about other dlts as well

2380
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,880
we've already received input from

2381
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,400
folks instead of hanging a second there

2382
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,000
are other dlts

2383
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,040
i know apart from ethereum we know that

2384
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,320
but we would like to get insight from

2385
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,480
people who do work with them

2386
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,719
other proof of work systems

2387
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,480
proof of stake which works significantly

2388
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,920
different in the impact on the overlay

2389
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,199
management

2390
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:51,119
insights into ethereum as well we're

2391
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:53,600
doing this already as i said as we speak

2392
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,440
other network innovations

2393
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,440
the use of ip multicast list that's

2394
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,360
something dino works on

2395
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,800
that we're going to talk also about

2396
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:01,920
tomorrow

2397
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,280
and the impact of those network

2398
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,639
innovations if you assume doesn't we're

2399
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:06,880
going to take innovations what would be

2400
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,960
the impact how would you mitigate the

2401
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,800
impact we observed

2402
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,960
over traditional ip and that's something

2403
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,400
we also work on

2404
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,679
most importantly we're looking for

2405
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:17,360
collaborators so this is meant to be a

2406
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,119
living draft

2407
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:22,800
so hopefully we get other people to join

2408
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,239
you're eating into your next

2409
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,480
presentation already significantly yeah

2410
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:27,280
yes

2411
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,159
so

2412
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:29,840
we need the why someone the reason doing

2413
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,000
this as as i mentioned

2414
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,239
stay over there

2415
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:35,600
is to better understand the impact of

2416
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,000
dlt so folks who have had insights into

2417
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,840
dlts place contact us we're very

2418
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:40,960
interested to

2419
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,040
incorporate that in any updates

2420
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,880
any possible mitigation if you worked on

2421
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,119
epic innovations where you mitigated

2422
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:49,760
some impacts we observed very good any

2423
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,920
contributors please drop us an email

2424
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:52,960
there's also there's a bit of

2425
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,560
advertisement there for a site meeting

2426
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:55,600
tomorrow

2427
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,679
that's going to happen on dlt and

2428
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:00,320
networking it will have the spins of

2429
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,840
impact of dlts and networks and the

2430
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,199
other way around we're going to talk our

2431
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:04,719
dino is going to talk about lisp and

2432
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,080
what they've done we're going to talk

2433
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,440
about a bit more

2434
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,760
detail of what i described today already

2435
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,440
some of the new insights

2436
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,679
so if that fits for anybody 6 000 pm

2437
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,760
local time please join that's just the

2438
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,040
site meeting by the way it's not going

2439
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,159
to be

2440
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:19,600
official oriented or whatever that's

2441
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,360
just people coming together and talking

2442
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:22,960
about this topic so if you're interested

2443
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,480
in please join us there's a question

2444
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:29,119
from nicola smiley nicola go ahead

2445
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,400
hi this is nicola um one question have

2446
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,400
you looked at the security implication

2447
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,400
i'm thinking for example about routing

2448
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,480
security i think there was some research

2449
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:39,760
on uh

2450
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,679
you know uh using for example uh

2451
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:44,719
hijackings for stealing bitcoin or i'm

2452
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,960
also thinking about dos for example for

2453
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,840
a leader based

2454
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,840
uh you know bfts um

2455
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,199
is it is it something that you have been

2456
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:56,480
looking at or just uh not yet or so so

2457
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,159
our current focus has been largely in

2458
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,520
quantitative performance but the

2459
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,199
security part in recent discussions so

2460
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:02,560
it's not in the draft at the moment but

2461
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,760
certainly something if you could send me

2462
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,040
for instance the research that would be

2463
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,199
great and as i mentioned if

2464
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:08,880
i'm not trusting the dlt but i'm

2465
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,639
throwing my ip address out so it's it's

2466
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:12,080
quite clear that there are a lot of

2467
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,600
interesting privacy and security

2468
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,600
implications you know on that and i'd

2469
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,280
really like to hear more about that

2470
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,719
all right i'll see you at the meeting

2471
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:21,360
then yeah thank you thanks

2472
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,400
and

2473
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,400
next presentation

2474
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,560
yours as well

2475
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:30,800
do i need to request that again uh

2476
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,480
engine

2477
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,440
you're loading slides

2478
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:39,040
yeah it's coming up good thanks

2479
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,960
you've got five minutes

2480
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,679
oh i met

2481
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:44,840
so

2482
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,800
we

2483
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:47,760
gotcha

2484
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,719
or we can move it for you if you want

2485
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:52,480
that one didn't show up before

2486
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,159
getting used to the remote tool is a bit

2487
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:55,440
buggy

2488
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:56,880
in places

2489
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:57,679
so

2490
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:00,560
this is a draft um goes away from from

2491
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,119
dlts but even though we are also seeking

2492
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:06,159
obviously input by the wider community

2493
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:08,400
this draft talks about is purely

2494
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,920
observational we look at how the

2495
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,440
internet has evolved from what we

2496
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,199
usually in particular

2497
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:14,960
very often simplistically teach people

2498
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,400
on what the intent is really doing and

2499
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,719
that's reachability and it's it's

2500
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,800
title continuing the internet to evolve

2501
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,000
the internet riding beyond mere

2502
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,639
reachability

2503
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,239
it's intended to seat discussions and

2504
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,159
how we can continue with the observed

2505
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:32,000
evolution of the internal routing system

2506
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,760
and i said that the draft is positioned

2507
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,920
as being purely observational

2508
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,520
we're not proposing any solutions we're

2509
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:38,800
just saying that's what's going on how

2510
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,119
do we want to continue doing this

2511
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:43,280
we want to engage with the community on

2512
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,520
to identify on possible next steps so

2513
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,960
that this routing evolution that we've

2514
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,440
been observing for the many many years

2515
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:52,080
actually continues

2516
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,760
structure of the draft there as well so

2517
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,639
we i'm going through two three and four

2518
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,159
uh section

2519
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,320
in in in these slides

2520
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:01,760
uh but there's also obviously more

2521
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,360
discussion on the on the issues which

2522
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:04,560
which i ask you to look through the

2523
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,679
slides in more detail

2524
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,000
so we start with the original purpose so

2525
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,360
this is kind of what we usually tell

2526
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,719
people of how the internet works all

2527
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:14,400
right um so originally it's designed to

2528
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,639
enable forwarding iep packets to a

2529
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:18,880
destination address that's good

2530
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,480
we have a locator semantic for ip

2531
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,159
addresses that's fundamental for doing

2532
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:23,600
this

2533
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,199
usually assigned the context for network

2534
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:27,600
topology so that we can get some

2535
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,239
sort of management of this address space

2536
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:31,760
we have distributed decision making and

2537
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,760
intermediary routers

2538
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:36,480
which sometimes also leads to issues

2539
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,960
uh uh uh and and writing problems in

2540
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,400
particular which some of the extensions

2541
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,480
are are particularly interesting

2542
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,000
key when looking at this is what's the

2543
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,600
method for forwarding for selecting the

2544
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,679
path and what's the criteria for doing

2545
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:48,480
so

2546
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,360
right

2547
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,040
traffic engineering may help you to

2548
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,639
avoid some of the routing problems so

2549
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:54,400
this is how the routing system really

2550
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,480
started but

2551
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,440
okay

2552
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,360
but there are many many extensions to

2553
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,679
this reachability part and i said the

2554
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,320
draft has gone through an exercise of

2555
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,119
listing those and and going through

2556
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:09,760
in the end 58 references that we found

2557
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,080
so far we by no means claim to be

2558
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,840
exhaustive but we just wanted to start

2559
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,760
somewhere 0.

2560
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,280
so you observe and survey those

2561
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,719
extensions

2562
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,719
and we list them based on what's the

2563
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:22,800
purpose for the extension what's the

2564
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,480
approach what's the underlying technical

2565
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,320
approach and you can just you know we

2566
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,000
can debate some of those

2567
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,600
taglines that we used

2568
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,040
and what are the examples what are the

2569
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,800
known solutions so we want to have the

2570
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,880
evidence part right

2571
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,880
and ultimately we hope that this may

2572
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,600
lead to some sort of taxonomy that looks

2573
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,000
at the capabilities of a routing system

2574
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,679
and the approaches for achieving those

2575
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:44,719
routing systems that's kind of what

2576
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,960
we're after with this section

2577
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,320
at the moment this is on the right-hand

2578
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,000
side it's just a snippet obviously of

2579
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,440
the entire table because the table has

2580
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,520
12 purposes which is the

2581
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,560
left most column 26 approaches in 58

2582
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,400
examples and i said not claiming to be

2583
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,000
exhaustive here

2584
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,679
so the key observation though that we're

2585
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:04,080
doing with that is

2586
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,920
is that the internet internet writing

2587
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,159
has been evolving so whatever we are

2588
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:09,679
saying about internet routing maybe you

2589
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,679
know all it does is reachability not

2590
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,199
really quite there's been a lot of stuff

2591
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,840
going on obviously that has been

2592
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,520
tweaking and changing things here and

2593
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,600
there in order to do certain purposes as

2594
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,760
we defined it using certain approaches

2595
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,840
that's the the observational part that

2596
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,080
we have in this draft

2597
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:28,560
but if you do those we also discuss in

2598
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,280
section four what are the possible

2599
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,440
issues when you take these approaches

2600
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,800
and start playing around with the

2601
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,320
routing system in order to achieve the

2602
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,920
purpose that you have in mind right that

2603
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,199
goes beyond pure reachability

2604
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:42,880
yeah and we outlined a number of them

2605
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,080
that are discussed in more detail in the

2606
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,840
draft limiting routing capability

2607
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,840
semantics so you fit the new purposes

2608
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,199
into the limitations of the old

2609
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:50,560
realizations there are a couple of

2610
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,080
examples that are given there for

2611
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,000
instance on content naming

2612
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,920
great idea to extend the

2613
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,600
purpose of the routing but unfortunately

2614
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,280
if you stick it into

2615
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,600
the limitations of an ip address you're

2616
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,000
limiting the actual new purpose itself

2617
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,560
right that's one of the examples we give

2618
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,080
complexity and efficiency because one

2619
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:10,719
minute yes or you have um repetitive

2620
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:12,239
encapsulation you have security

2621
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:13,920
fragility and operability number of

2622
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,239
issues that are being listed

2623
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:18,080
so we ask the routing working group in

2624
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,560
the draft at section five

2625
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,280
is to recognize that the evolution of

2626
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,719
the internet routing system has to take

2627
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:26,400
a wider architectural approach

2628
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,480
and not just start sticking

2629
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,159
extension here and there knock yourself

2630
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,159
out with the packet whatever you want to

2631
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,520
do

2632
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,480
there's a lot of research and

2633
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,639
development routing systems ongoing

2634
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,719
research being published developments in

2635
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:40,480
companies and these works must be

2636
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,800
brought into the process of the itf and

2637
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,800
we believe it must be brought to the itf

2638
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,000
before

2639
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,520
we start sticking it into a new

2640
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,679
specification because that's relatively

2641
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:50,560
late

2642
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,719
and we believe looking at the

2643
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:54,560
routing working group charter that is

2644
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,080
that the routing work group should play

2645
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:57,760
a role in all of this because as it says

2646
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,760
and we are quoting the the charter there

2647
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,040
the routing area working group is

2648
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,199
chartered to provide a venue to discuss

2649
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:04,080
and that's kind of like what we are

2650
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,239
looking for to discuss evaluate and

2651
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:09,280
support new proposals

2652
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,440
so we're establishing five uh three

2653
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,199
sorry five three actions in the in the

2654
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:15,360
traffic that we're suggesting either to

2655
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:17,119
establish suitable offers with efforts

2656
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:19,440
within routing working group

2657
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,760
or to support the establishment of

2658
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,239
suitable efforts as a standalone working

2659
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:25,840
group which could be for instance called

2660
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,199
the future of internet routing that's

2661
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:29,280
just the suggestion

2662
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,119
or support the establishment of suitable

2663
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:33,440
efforts within the irtf where these

2664
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,600
efforts directly lays back with the

2665
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,199
routing working group through regular

2666
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,719
updates in its meeting so what's going

2667
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:41,040
on at the moment there right so these

2668
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,880
are the suggestions we are making in the

2669
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,480
draft

2670
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:47,360
and what we ask for is commons

2671
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,199
both on the recognition

2672
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:51,760
and the uh the suggested actions either

2673
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,760
here on the list we also have this the

2674
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,600
the manifesto that i linked in here

2675
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,239
which luigi uh published last year with

2676
01:47:58,239 --> 01:47:59,920
other courses

2677
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,119
and

2678
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:02,639
important what we want to say is we are

2679
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:03,760
not

2680
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,000
asking to risk this is something that in

2681
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,239
exchange was was put to us we're not

2682
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:09,600
asking to risk the investment of the

2683
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,880
internet

2684
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,679
um

2685
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:13,920
just to make architecture a process on

2686
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,679
the contrary we want to ensure that we

2687
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:17,360
have a continued evolution without the

2688
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:18,960
issues that we observe in the actual

2689
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,800
draft so when i ask you to throw this

2690
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,159
all away

2691
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:23,840
and open the

2692
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,199
discussion for

2693
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:27,600
the pure research purpose but actually

2694
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,360
really ensure that we can continue doing

2695
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,280
routing evolution

2696
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,800
sustainably and i would really need your

2697
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,440
stuff now thank you thank you uh while

2698
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,520
agent is loading andrea draft a couple

2699
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,600
of comments so there is no concept of

2700
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,679
subgroup within group

2701
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:42,960
in atf

2702
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,239
rtf

2703
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,960
probably two knowledge had a research

2704
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,520
group focused on evolution of internet

2705
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,880
so

2706
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,600
bringing it to rtf if you are doing

2707
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,840
research probably the right thing to do

2708
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,520
obviously you can also ask for working

2709
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:00,320
group in itf but this far i don't think

2710
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,560
there's enough

2711
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,280
meat on the bonds to really do this

2712
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,080
so

2713
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:07,600
if there are significant interest we can

2714
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,440
definitely have an interim meeting

2715
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,760
focused on what you're trying to do

2716
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,639
so please send an email to the list and

2717
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:15,920
see whether you can gather enough

2718
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,239
interest to continue this work here

2719
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:21,440
practically it feels like irtf probably

2720
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,840
would be the good place to continue this

2721
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,880
effort

2722
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,920
okay thank you thank you thanks

2723
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:30,880
uh adrian

2724
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,159
yes i'm requested slide

2725
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:35,840
and

2726
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,320
engine

2727
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:42,960
slide share requested but nothing

2728
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,360
happening

2729
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,480
uh

2730
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:47,840
robin could you please send your

2731
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,679
question to the list sorry we are really

2732
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:51,520
running out of time

2733
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,760
okay

2734
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:59,599
oh cunning they're not in order right

2735
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:02,320
okay um

2736
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:05,760
i will squeeze this into the last 11

2737
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,080
minutes uh no problem and spend most of

2738
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:10,480
the time reading the the long title on

2739
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:11,920
this slide

2740
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,400
um so this is about things that we think

2741
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,480
that researchers should look at when

2742
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,760
they're doing work um and proposing new

2743
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:26,480
approaches for internet routing

2744
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,960
and we've come up with some challenges

2745
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:32,239
which are in the the draft noted at the

2746
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:34,560
bottom of this slide

2747
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:37,280
the main things uh we're looking at are

2748
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,199
things that are not always looked at

2749
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:40,400
properly

2750
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:43,119
when new routing proposals are made

2751
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:45,920
things like stability and scalability

2752
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,320
security privacy manageability in

2753
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,639
particular

2754
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,800
and interactions with other parts of the

2755
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,159
network

2756
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:55,040
um

2757
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:56,239
so

2758
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:59,840
that work breaks down into examining the

2759
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,960
fragilities in the current system uh in

2760
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:05,360
particular what what breakages do we

2761
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:07,199
often see

2762
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:10,320
and the architectural considerations

2763
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,800
um whether this is evolution or

2764
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,599
revolution

2765
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,400
and then questions that we think that

2766
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,239
research and development should be

2767
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:23,119
spending more time on

2768
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:24,639
working out what the deployment

2769
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:26,239
architecture is

2770
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:29,760
what assumptions of traffic patterns are

2771
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:32,400
are influencing the way the design is

2772
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,880
done what is the techno-economic

2773
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,719
motivation in other words why are you

2774
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:38,880
actually doing this work is it just

2775
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,119
because it's fun or is there some

2776
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:43,840
driving force

2777
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,239
and then beyond that uh the research

2778
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:48,320
principles

2779
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,560
that are quite often neglected

2780
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:51,679
are

2781
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:52,960
looking at

2782
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:55,679
realistic networks and realistic traffic

2783
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:57,760
flows rather than the

2784
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,840
sort of powerpoint linear network that

2785
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:02,639
we often see

2786
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:04,800
used to prove

2787
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,400
new approaches

2788
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,360
and

2789
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:10,080
the ability to independently reproduce

2790
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,159
the research

2791
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:14,960
so none of this is uh

2792
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,840
attempting to criticize uh we're just

2793
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,520
trying to be a little bit more helpful

2794
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:25,440
uh so where this all started was uh us

2795
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,599
looking at semantic routing and we've

2796
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:30,480
we've heard a couple of um

2797
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:33,199
presentations today talk about semantic

2798
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:35,760
routing and semantic addressing

2799
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,520
and this

2800
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:40,800
from our perspective is layer 3 hot by

2801
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,880
hop rooting and forwarding

2802
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,719
so not overlays

2803
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:46,000
um

2804
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,280
not traffic engineering

2805
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,080
uh

2806
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:53,040
it's extending the historic routing

2807
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,040
algorithms that have been used to

2808
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,320
generate

2809
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,480
forwarding instructions

2810
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,880
um where we've had distributed but

2811
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:04,880
identical algorithms or central planning

2812
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:08,000
um and based on information known

2813
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,800
about or gathered from the network

2814
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,480
so originally that was all just

2815
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:15,119
reachability destination address

2816
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:17,360
and as uh dirk has just said we're

2817
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,360
moving beyond that

2818
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,960
um

2819
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,679
semantic routing then is looking at

2820
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:26,400
additional information that is placed in

2821
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,440
the packet somehow

2822
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,280
whether that's in

2823
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:34,000
additional fields or overloading

2824
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,159
existing fields or partitioning the

2825
01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:37,920
address space

2826
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,159
and it's describing the treatment that

2827
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:42,239
the package should receive

2828
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:44,080
within the network

2829
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:47,040
um so the routine decides what the next

2830
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,760
hop is for each piece of information and

2831
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,440
the forwarding acts on those

2832
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,840
instructions uh looking at the

2833
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:57,119
information in packets

2834
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:59,199
so to some extent all routing and

2835
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:01,919
forwarding

2836
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:04,639
so far has been

2837
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:06,800
semantic routing and forwarding but

2838
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,119
we're looking at extending that so you

2839
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:12,400
can get a sort of bigger overview or an

2840
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:16,719
introduction in the draft listed there

2841
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,239
very very quickly uh this figure just

2842
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:21,599
shows that

2843
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:23,760
architecturally it looks like it's no

2844
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,840
big deal we're sort of adding the red

2845
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,159
words semantic

2846
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:31,040
into an architecture but i think this is

2847
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:34,639
an overly simplistic representation

2848
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:35,440
and

2849
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:38,560
uh what needs to happen is a better look

2850
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:41,280
at the architectural implications

2851
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,440
uh and the consequences for the routing

2852
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:46,239
system and maybe a step back and say

2853
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:48,719
what are we trying to build and and why

2854
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:52,320
and how does this all fit together

2855
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:55,840
uh so as background as we worked on

2856
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:59,679
semantic routing we did a survey uh

2857
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:01,239
and we found that there were an

2858
01:55:01,239 --> 01:55:03,840
extraordinarily large number of pieces

2859
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,119
of work

2860
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:07,360
that were

2861
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,960
in this space

2862
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,520
and many of them had

2863
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,760
petered out some of them had failed some

2864
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,840
of them had limited niche

2865
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:18,880
applicability and we started to think

2866
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,360
about the common themes in researching

2867
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:24,880
and testing and developing these ideas

2868
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,679
and the overlaps between other systems

2869
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:30,400
in particular sdn

2870
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:33,280
and their applicabilities in particular

2871
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:36,080
environments and this led us to

2872
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:39,040
formulate uh our challenges and research

2873
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,520
questions

2874
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:44,560
um so why talk to you even about this

2875
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,480
well we think the challenges apply more

2876
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,360
widely to all routine research although

2877
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:52,239
we started with semantic routing

2878
01:55:52,239 --> 01:55:54,960
uh we're not trying to tell this uh

2879
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:57,920
working group what you already know

2880
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,760
and it's probable that they're one or

2881
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,000
two people here who have some experience

2882
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,520
in routing

2883
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:06,800
what we want to do is firm up this work

2884
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,880
with opinions from the real world so

2885
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,800
what have we identified that's not

2886
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,560
really a problem

2887
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,400
uh what have we missed

2888
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,759
and what have we left out

2889
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,480
so i have three slides here which are

2890
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,480
sort of extracted from the draft and i'm

2891
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,719
going to skip them because you can read

2892
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:29,400
the draft and we're running out of time

2893
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:33,520
they basically categorize the challenges

2894
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,599
and the things that people should think

2895
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:36,639
about

2896
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:39,520
as they propose new ideas as they do new

2897
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:40,840
routing

2898
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,920
work as you'll see the last one there it

2899
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,159
does anything need to be standardized

2900
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:48,239
and that comes back to the discussion in

2901
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:49,520
the satellite

2902
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:53,280
work that was raised before

2903
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:54,080
so

2904
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:55,840
what are we going to do with this work

2905
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:58,400
um as authors we're not completely sure

2906
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,520
um

2907
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,800
we don't know where to discuss it uh

2908
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,719
uh we do have a place for discussing

2909
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:08,000
semantic routing that's uh on a disk

2910
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,679
um mailing list and maybe the chairs

2911
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:13,679
here would be happy for us to talk about

2912
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:17,280
it a bit more in rtgwg

2913
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:20,239
we do want to develop the draft

2914
01:57:20,239 --> 01:57:21,840
and we're not sure whether to turn it

2915
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:25,199
into a general document or restrict it

2916
01:57:25,199 --> 01:57:28,719
to the semantic routing work

2917
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:30,159
obviously we're going to polish and

2918
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:31,280
extend

2919
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:35,040
and take feedback from you guys

2920
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,440
and that sort of takes me to this slide

2921
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,679
which is is is what we're doing useful

2922
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:41,599
or a waste of time

2923
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:43,840
are there things we have uh that are

2924
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,960
wrong

2925
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,520
uh what else should we include and where

2926
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,520
should we discuss it

2927
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:51,040
there you go chairs you have two and a

2928
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:52,719
half minutes

2929
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:55,360
uh let's take up a question and uh i'll

2930
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:58,480
try to comment sir thank

2931
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:01,920
you about two minutes for people please

2932
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,360
be quick

2933
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:06,480
okay uh some discussion in korea about

2934
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,320
it so could you please brief us the

2935
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:10,960
process here

2936
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,520
um

2937
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:17,040
i what i can say is we we

2938
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,400
talked to

2939
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:21,840
the irtf chair and he said um

2940
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:25,360
try talking about this in the coin rg

2941
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:26,480
um

2942
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:31,440
we did and uh the coin rg chairs uh

2943
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:34,560
told us that routing is not really in

2944
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:39,199
scope for uh coin rg so um

2945
01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:41,440
we're happy to to have a home but we

2946
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:43,920
don't have one at the moment

2947
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,119
robin

2948
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:46,719
okay thank you okay

2949
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:49,679
uh in my question is that what's uh

2950
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:52,719
means the internet routine so i mean

2951
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:55,199
that's the your new thesis

2952
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:57,679
today talk about the ceramic routine but

2953
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:00,800
uh if we use used for the truly the

2954
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,960
internet so i think that maybe that's

2955
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,440
the research work that take a long time

2956
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,599
i used to use for the limited domain

2957
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:10,800
such as satellite network that's maybe

2958
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,480
engineering work

2959
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,719
am i for my suggestion is better to

2960
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:17,199
distinguish the different scenario for

2961
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:18,159
this

2962
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:20,800
for this internet routine usual semantic

2963
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:24,000
uh address routine that will be helpful

2964
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,320
to distinguish where to have this work

2965
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:32,080
yeah okay that's useful thank you

2966
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:34,960
okay jeffrey

2967
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:35,920
jeff

2968
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:38,080
i adrian two quick comments uh comment

2969
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:40,080
one i think this is useful work and i

2970
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:41,599
would like to see it carried forward

2971
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:43,920
regardless of what group it ends up in

2972
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:46,239
comment number two is that uh you have a

2973
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:48,080
very good list and i'd like to suggest

2974
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:50,080
that you add to it incremental

2975
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:52,080
maintenance of the mechanism that's the

2976
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:54,639
thing that you usually enjoy

2977
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:56,880
nice nice thank you yes

2978
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:00,639
that's it thank you derek

2979
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:03,840
tarksad uh with juniper thanks adrian

2980
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:06,400
for the great presentation haven't read

2981
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,960
the draft i admit i'll promise to read

2982
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,920
it

2983
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,639
it's not a question it's a comment

2984
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:14,960
i see resemblance in semantic routing

2985
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,639
what you're proposing on semantic

2986
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:19,520
routing and some work we

2987
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,440
myself and our co-authors are driving in

2988
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,360
teas working group

2989
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:25,360
where we carry

2990
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:27,280
something in the packet that influences

2991
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:28,400
the

2992
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,000
packet forwarding

2993
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,159
uh or the routing decision um

2994
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:35,599
on the on on

2995
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:37,440
on hops along the path

2996
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:41,360
um i i think this uh work is useful and

2997
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:44,480
just wanted to make that comment thanks

2998
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:46,320
yeah thank you tarek and i should add

2999
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:49,840
that to the uh survey uh and you know

3000
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:52,840
you'll notice that apn um talked about

3001
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:57,199
earlier also influences the the path

3002
02:00:57,199 --> 02:01:00,800
and i think that um

3003
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,040
a question that needs to be looked at

3004
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:06,000
more generally is whether there should

3005
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:06,960
be

3006
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,679
uh an attempt to do a generic

3007
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:11,119
uh approach

3008
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:14,400
uh rather than um

3009
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:17,840
picking environment specific or solution

3010
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:22,560
not solution use case specific um

3011
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:25,920
approaches and ways of doing this maybe

3012
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:28,159
we can come acro come

3013
02:01:28,159 --> 02:01:29,599
away with

3014
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:33,280
some generic encoding that's um

3015
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:36,080
a little more capable of being used in

3016
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,840
many different scenarios i think that

3017
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:41,360
might help the implement implementers

3018
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:44,159
if we can do it in a way that isn't uh

3019
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:46,800
too costly

3020
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:49,280
colin and we cut the here granting

3021
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,520
please take it to the list colin go

3022
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,679
ahead

3023
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:55,280
hi can you hear me

3024
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,320
yeah

3025
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:58,400
yes okay thank you

3026
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:01,599
um so i just wanted to to follow up on

3027
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:04,080
the comments about coinage

3028
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:06,400
about how this has been um handled in

3029
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:08,800
the irtf um

3030
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:12,239
i think that the feedback i gave to

3031
02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:14,560
adrian previously was not to take the

3032
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:16,480
work to coinage

3033
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:18,800
it was the parts of the work overlap

3034
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:22,239
with the scope of coinage

3035
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:24,719
and i agree that coin rg is not a

3036
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:28,080
routing group um but what coin rg is

3037
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,760
looking at is

3038
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,280
how the network is becoming more

3039
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:32,480
programmable

3040
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:34,239
and some of the implications of

3041
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:36,639
in-network computation and programmable

3042
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:39,040
data planes and so on

3043
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:41,040
and that i think overlaps with some of

3044
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:44,400
the um the discussions um

3045
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,560
you know in teas group uh some of the

3046
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,480
discussions about you know as adrian

3047
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:51,280
said earlier about what happens when um

3048
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:53,599
the routing has chosen a path and how

3049
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:55,199
does the

3050
02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:56,960
the data plane handle the forwarding of

3051
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,320
that path

3052
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:01,520
um so i i do think there is uh at least

3053
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:04,000
some overlap with the scope of coin rg

3054
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,080
although that's clearly not everything

3055
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:07,760
here

3056
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:12,239
um i would probably argue that um parts

3057
02:03:12,239 --> 02:03:14,719
of this work also overlap with the ic

3058
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:17,199
energy and perhaps some of the topics

3059
02:03:17,199 --> 02:03:18,400
that

3060
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,000
were mentioned in the previous talk or

3061
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,400
so overlap in that space

3062
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:24,880
because that group's considering um what

3063
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:27,199
happens when the um

3064
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:30,159
you know the routing identifies content

3065
02:03:30,159 --> 02:03:32,000
uh and the forwarding identifies

3066
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,320
contents rather than ip addresses

3067
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:36,800
um but but yes i i certainly agree that

3068
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:38,639
most of this uh

3069
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:42,080
does not seem in scope for the i i rtf

3070
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:43,840
it seems much closer to engineering

3071
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:45,040
although

3072
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:46,239
the feedback

3073
02:03:46,239 --> 02:03:48,000
i've given in the past is that parts of

3074
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,159
it fall within the scope of some of the

3075
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:54,040
the irtf groups

3076
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,599
adrian would you want to respond or

3077
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:01,679
just take no information

3078
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:05,199
i i have nothing to add to that

3079
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:06,880
so the work seems to be really

3080
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:09,520
interesting and it's common theme for

3081
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,280
half presentations here so something is

3082
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:13,760
going on and

3083
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:16,000
personally i would really like to make

3084
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,520
something of this work whether we call

3085
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,440
semantic routing or policy-based routing

3086
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:22,000
on steroids right the willingness to

3087
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,719
extend route lookups beyond destination

3088
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:27,360
ap address is definitely present so

3089
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:29,520
we'll discuss with our id

3090
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:31,119
potentially we could have interim

3091
02:04:31,119 --> 02:04:33,599
meeting focused on

3092
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:36,639
the team and we'll come back please do

3093
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:39,599
stay active on the list and solicit

3094
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:42,480
feedback and try to progress it

3095
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,320
lovely thank you

3096
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:46,400
thank you so much and thanks everyone

3097
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:49,119
and hope to see you in philadelphia and

3098
02:04:49,119 --> 02:04:51,040
hope to see much

3099
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:53,119
many more people in the room

3100
02:04:53,119 --> 02:04:56,119
thanks

3101
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:28,559
you
