uh mopex capabilities and it

118
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,880

119
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,520
attention on that and the

120
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,600
role story acknowledge

121
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,199
probably we will need

122
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,199
drive a working group adoption for it

123
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,160
we just got the new work adopted

124
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,479
on that work about the fast border

125
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,520
router grass detection

126
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,199
uh okay so for milestones

127
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,199
um

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,800
well we have

129
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,199
we proposed changes i don't know dominic

130
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,639
we want to

131
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,120
take lead on this okay well the

132
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
microsoft haven't been updated in a

133
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,039
while and so they're lagging by maybe a

134
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,080
year or two so it's about time to

135
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
refresh those

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,199
um

137
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
so here are the milestones that were

138
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,440
defined

139
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,880
so far and i'm we're proposing new dates

140
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,240
so we've put years but not months

141
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
so um

142
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
can we

143
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
have an estimate for those and so

144
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,479
that we can refresh the milestones so

145
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,400
let's go through them uh their

146
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,759
projection

147
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,880
um

148
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
i think this can be submitted to asg

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,919
within this year

150
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,318
um

151
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,240

152
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
and your jp

153
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,240
or maybe alvaro based on your own

154
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
queue

155
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,840
when you think this would be reasonable

156
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,980

161
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,880
working group can do

162
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
uh my my queue yes is very deep right

163
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520

finding a way to

170
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
drain the queue a little bit faster

171
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,560
there were some documents especially

172
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
last year that were bigger documents not

173
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160

know process as you normally would and

178
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,759
i'll um

179
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,280
try and take care of this

180
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,039
faster

181
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,080
okay thank you

182
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,759
if you were asking for the dow

183
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,400
projection yes

184
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,800
my take is

185
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,919
we had more than one very deep review

186
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,199
recently

187
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,000
and you will see in my updates but uh

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,919
yeah i think we are we are we have

189
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,000
reached the quality of uh

190
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
workgroup call

191
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,560
so i will be happy when you start it

192
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,319
and and my status was uh remo saris was

193
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,479
supposed to give one last review before

194
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,960
walker crystal but since we got one for

195
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,199
from lee one from torres

196
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,639
um

197
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,360
i think remoussary's review can can be

198
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,520
one of those for lasko

199
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,840
as opposed to before let's go

200
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
so may to

201
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
may is fine

202
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,280
may

203
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,080
oh

204
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,759
my god yeah definitely even earlier i

205
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,479
mean

206
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,319
if you start the workplace call now i

207
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680
mean as soon as you know the current

208
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
last goals are completed

209
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,159
um you may start this one and then

210
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,479
it's a matter of amount of max again

211
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,440
this is submission to asg so i guess

212
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,160
this is after id review is that correct

213
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,360
uh

214
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,519
no uh

215
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,880
after working group last call i think

216
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,839
when

217
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,040
it's a projection as the name says no

218
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
projection

219
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,959
uh

220
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
there are some open issues maybe

221
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,880
june or

222
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,560
september

223
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,959
what do you think michael

224
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,040
um i'm just looking and i'm thinking we

225
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,279
we should fix the title

226
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,320
um maybe the title is wrong but um

227
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
uh yeah no i i actually think we really

228
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,200
could push the button before uh

229
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
are at around the next ietf i think so i

230
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,399
think i mean it's it got to maturity

231
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,839
point and then we said oops so uh

232
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,760
i think we just need to resolve

233
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
uh the discussion as to what we need to

234
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,720
do and we'll do that probably maybe

235
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
today even

236
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,519
it's already had a few reviews so i

237
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,839
think so i think certainly by the end of

238
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,440
the summer but i think even earlier

239
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,720
maybe the beginning of the summer

240
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,200
hmm almost is fine on september yeah

241
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
okay

242
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,560
okay

243
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,399
september

244
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,680
and then one more picks and

245
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,480
capability that we have to there do two

246
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
milestones because there are two

247
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,680
documents

248
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
so maybe we

249
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,199
aim for november

250
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,600
i

251
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,120
i think that's

252
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,720
maybe reasonable but that's good it's

253
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,480
going to take us uh i think we're going

254
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
to need some some uh

255
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
some interim meetings to to get to that

256
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,839
because i think there's still a lot of

257
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,680
of open questions

258
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,279
uh that

259
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,320
there and and it

260
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,200
uh

261
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,079
yeah

262
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,200
it would be great to have some

263
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
implementations uh to do something like

264
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,399
this

265
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,839
our team

266
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,279
okay yes uh

267
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,880
will you implement mop x and capex

268
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,519
no okay

269
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
uh thank you for the comment and then

270
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
the well contract work just started so

271
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,240
it will be pushed for

272
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
next year

273
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,200
and then these modifications

274
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,240
uh dominic

275
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,480
or yes

276
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,120
i wrote 2023 so i stand by it

277
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
okay

278
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
and then

279
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,600
yes

280
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,680
okay for

281
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,560
young model friend mpl

282
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,880
um

283
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,079
do you want to work on this topic

284
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,480
i mean this is anybody still working on

285
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
that

286
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,839
okay yes

287
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,120
um then

288
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,720
so the question is do we want to drop

289
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,959
some milestone

290
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,680
or is anybody willing to work on it

291
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,560
to resurrect it

292
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,360
this is the yang model

293
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,600
something we already adopted

294
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,959
and no

295
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,120
it was uh

296
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,959
by a long time ago it was driven by

297
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,959
peter right but it was adopted by the

298
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,160
working group and it's part of the

299
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
milestone so what do we do

300
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,440
yeah

301
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,040
i i don't think we're gonna finish it

302
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,040
okay we can

303
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,000
we can confirm in the mailing list

304
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,760
yes

305
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,959
okay

306
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,959
okay some of the comments that we got

307
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,360
for out every ripple that they they need

308
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,920
as well the young model for that

309
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,399
was a request from the area director but

310
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,399
it's a other public but it's really a

311
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,720
bit young so

312
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
maybe at some point we need to consider

313
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
this for the management part

314
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:08,720
right

315
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,120
other can we remove milestones what's

316
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,959
the process for that

317
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,160
do we need to get approval

318
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,519
yeah hi i'll go right on about anything

319
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,639
yes so the um

320
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,040
the part of the required process is the

321
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,320
charter right we need to change the

322
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,360
charter

323
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,920
um to change the milestones uh you know

324
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,440
you change them you add the lead

325
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,760
whatever i'm gonna get an email to to

326
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,880
approve but in general you know this is

327
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,000
um

328
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
a big part of this is your decision

329
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,360
now as you know i said um the asg is

330
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,240
paying specialization to manageability

331
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,000
and the normal question comes up with

332
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
every draft so where's the yang model

333
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,519
for this how are we going to manage this

334
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,800
network

335
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,040
um

336
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
the one thing that that you know we

337
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,279
probably or you need to discuss in the

338
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,600
working group is you know how do these

339
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,760
networks get managed you know is yang

340
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,000
the appropriate way to do it are there

341
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,440
other tools

342
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,480
um

343
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,760
you know i don't know because if we need

344
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,959
um

345
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,399
work to be done you know we need to work

346
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,680
work to be done because otherwise the

347
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,519
solutions wouldn't be complete uh

348
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,959
ideally we would find people in the

349
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,800
working group that are interested

350
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
um so maybe that's the type of

351
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,000
conversation that we need to have

352
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,920
because not all

353
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,680
uh say iot related deployments are going

354
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,360
to have the same type of manageability

355
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,480
that

356
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
other networks or other types of numbers

357
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,440
are going to have

358
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
so if yang makes sense sure at some

359
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,199
point we need to do it if it doesn't

360
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,560
make sense

361
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
um

362
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,440
then you know maybe not

363
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,760
so we can then negotiate that when we

364
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,839
recharge it at some point so we don't we

365
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,880
don't have a a work item right now as a

366
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,399
yang model for

367
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,760
ripple

368
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,240
okay this is a yang model for mipple

369
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,120
correct right and i would say that

370
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,079
that there's close to zero deployment of

371
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,199
nipple

372
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,320
today

373
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,000
um some of the lighting and building

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,040
people were very enthusiastic about it

375
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
and

376
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,000
i don't know if they're still

377
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,560
enthusiastic about it maybe that that

378
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,880
may be one of the questions we don't

379
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,320
like why i'm saying i don't think we'll

380
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,680
complete it because i don't think the

381
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,199
people that even have a mipple

382
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,399
are are participating anymore and i

383
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,760
don't think i can write a management

384
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,519
protocol for a protocol i haven't

385
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,600
implemented right so

386
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
um

387
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,839
i think

388
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,279
yeah actually

389
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,800
mentioned the ripple and middle

390
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,399
management

391
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,279
data model for those it's mentioned in

392
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,160
the

393
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,680
in the workings in the charter

394
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,920
but yeah probably

395
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,880
there is

396
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,839
people that have some other priorities

397
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,480
pascal do you want to

398
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,519
say something

399
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,279
uh meepo is your my son so uh not that i

400
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,360
like it

401
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,079
now

402
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,880
is not using my runner

403
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,120
so you can refine

404
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
get somebody who is interested in

405
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,320
working on the network which is young

406
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
for repo

407
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,839
how can we expect a great model

408
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
so we can keep it in the charter but it

409
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,839
is the work item right

410
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,519
i have trouble hearing you so

411
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,480
either can you restate slowly or go to

412
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,639
the notes and fix what i just typed

413
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,519
i heard you saying wise and used maple

414
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,800
but now

415
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,399
and i lost the rest of it

416
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,839
let me switch device because

417
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,520
can you hear me better with this class

418
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,119
you just switched my yeah this is better

419
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,919
okay so i was saying people is being

420
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,959
used by myself

421
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,119
uh but

422
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,799
by side is not using young

423
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,160
and until we have an actual deployment

424
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,840
that

425
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,039
uses ripple and my our people had

426
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,360
decided to work with yank

427
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,640
i don't see that we will get

428
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,559
resources to

429
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,080
develop the young model

430
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,799
and

431
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,440
not keeping the charter is okay but the

432
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,120
workata is stored

433
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,000
it will be stored for a while

434
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,720
uh what the white zone ysan is using for

435
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,679
management npl

436
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,679
well they have their home based

437
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,240
management

438
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,240
okay

439
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,360
thank you

440
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,120
it's documented within the weissen

441
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,160
standard

442
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
but it's not

443
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,360
it's not an

444
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,399
it's it's a squad

445
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,600
okay we will take uh to confirmation in

446
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,480
the main list of the removal of this

447
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,000
uh

448
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,440
work

449
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,919
thank you i can't say we necessarily

450
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,320
have to remove it from the charter

451
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,679
because maybe one day somebody will use

452
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,840
young for managing a report network so

453
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,760
let's have the charter idle

454
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,120
but

455
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,479
we are not working on it it's a fact

456
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,600
okay

457
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
thank you

458
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,200
about the next topic

459
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,360
uh self-taught multicast for ripple

460
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,039
do we have some comments on it

461
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,000
yes i uh

462
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,080
i have two comments

463
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,679
well the first one is

464
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,000
benjamin you know is stepping out and

465
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,799
he's doing all his reviews but if you

466
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,840
watch

467
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,600
his review

468
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
he just obtained

469
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,160
but if you look inside the review you

470
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,320
will see why he abstained

471
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,960
and he's basically telling us that the

472
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,799
work group has not done before work

473
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,559
the quality of the document was not good

474
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,840
enough when it

475
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
twitched isg that's what ben is telling

476
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,080
us i'm paraphrasing but please look at

477
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,559
his words

478
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,720
and i was asked to do a review on

479
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,799
version 13

480
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,000
i did

481
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,679
i published it

482
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,880
um i used gentle words but

483
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,799
no sorry we are not talking about how

484
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,039
they be labeled it's sort of

485
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,320
uh they

486
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,000
oh i'm sorry just was not against oh

487
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,039
sorry i chose a sauce

488
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,918
sorry

489
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,919
oh no no no progress on that we just

490
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,600
discussed it with gaston this morning

491
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,679
because we because of the other draft

492
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,320
the the one on the story a non-starring

493
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,240
mode multicast which which i will be

494
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,360
discussing

495
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,919
uh so he said did somebody work on how

496
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,000
that interacts with c-cast

497
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,880
but

498
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,120
that's the only news in years

499
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,559
and so i don't know that anybody's

500
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,480
working on success

501
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
so is there any intention to progress it

502
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
or

503
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,600
does it mean

504
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
it's

505
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,960
the only thing i know is probably a look

506
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,679
at it again with casper to see how it

507
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,960
integrates

508
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,080
with the uh multicast registration work

509
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,840
and the mach 5

510
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,000
but

511
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,880
i have no idea that there will be an

512
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
intersection

513
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,600
so

514
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,960
i don't know anybody's working on it

515
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,200
from years

516
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,520
okay

517
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,039
okay

518
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,720
thank you

519
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,039
and then one character working group are

520
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,559
close next year as well

521
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:01,840
okay

522
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,320
then um okay

523
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
we are going to be fast here there are

524
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,799
open the issues to be discussed today

525
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,280
about uh problem and enrollment priority

526
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,240
then we have additional open items for

527
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,679
obs triple observations and mopeds

528
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,240
and finally well as pascal was stating

529
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,400
that we have a new version of audible

530
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,600
ripple but still is

531
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,640
with the open issues there are tickets

532
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,280
credit for the reviews that we got and

533
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,960
for the

534
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,039
discuss and the abstain of pen comments

535
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,799
um

536
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,159
but yes now the work the this document

537
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,159
have changed the mode of operation to

538
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,400
four

539
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,400
i don't think

540
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,280
there is some outdoors online

541
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,120
i don't think so

542
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,120
but

543
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,960
uh okay but then um

544
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,760
this uh work is uh

545
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
some of the elders want to finish this

546
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,120
work

547
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,559
uh

548
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,280
but we would like to know if there is

549
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,880
interest in the working group to work in

550
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,960
this topic

551
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,600
there is one implementation from 2016

552
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,080
but it was not updated with the last

553
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,240
modifications

554
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,679
so basically we would like to know what

555
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,400
do you think if you want to work on this

556
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,720
topic

557
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,960
yes pascal

558
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,919
well i spent quite some time on this i

559
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,840
did i just do three reviews already

560
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,960
yes we didn't

561
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,840
the work has been very very slow

562
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,159
and at the moment it's very unclear that

563
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,240
what is specified works i mean from my

564
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,720
command and from ben's command

565
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,360
it's very very clear that

566
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
it works at all as described

567
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,039
so

568
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,960
we cannot push the button for

569
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,039
publication request at this time not at

570
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,840
all

571
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
and whether there are enough hands to

572
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,240
work on it i i i could do one more

573
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,480
review in the future no worries

574
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,360
but i will not contribute

575
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,400
and so

576
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
we need active contributor really

577
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,799
implement and

578
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,559
look at my commands it's not even clear

579
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,639
it works

580
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,080
okay thank you very much pascal

581
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,200
uh

582
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
so yes indeed this document they need to

583
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,559
be addressed

584
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
all the open issues before

585
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,840
further

586
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,799
uh further uh publishing process

587
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,960
what do you think alvaro it's not it's

588
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,720
not just saying uh yes or no on the

589
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
question right it's really describe the

590
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,600
mechanism because it's empty and it's as

591
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,200
this level description doesn't seem to

592
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,279
work so it goes deeper than just saying

593
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,320
yes or no to question

594
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,640
okay

595
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,120
well um i'll go over a thunder rolling

596
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,479
id so um

597
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,799
so this document already went through

598
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,559
working with last call and iatf last

599
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,960
call and asg evaluation and i read it

600
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,320
and everything else

601
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,720
and uh yes um you know there are

602
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,440
a number of topics that uh ben brought

603
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,960
up uh he ended up staying abstain

604
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
usually means

605
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,080
there's so much work that needs to be

606
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,279
done

607
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,480
but

608
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,360
i'm not um

609
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,480
i don't have time i'm not willing to

610
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,400
engage in that uh ben of course is

611
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,440
stepping down today as security ad so

612
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,200
you know he doesn't have any more

613
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,520
cycles to to work on this

614
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,159
um and and pascal's

615
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,480
recent review

616
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,039
really concerned me because um

617
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,120
again you know this document left the

618
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,480
working group

619
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,720
um a year ago or so um

620
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,760
we are at a point where

621
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,120
um

622
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,559
i could actually approve the document

623
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,640
there's enough positions to to move it

624
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,679
forward

625
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,640
but

626
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,200
there are enough

627
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,120
holes and things that need to be fixed

628
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,080
that

629
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,159
that's definitely not the right thing

630
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,159
um

631
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,080
the right thing to me seems to be to

632
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,880
return the document to the working group

633
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
uh which is where i think that the

634
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,720
question from ines comes of of was there

635
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,919
interest in the working group to work on

636
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:24,880
this topic

637
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
uh because if there isn't then of course

638
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
we're almost

639
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,799
sentencing the document to death right

640
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,480
because we're returning it

641
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,400
if the worker is not going to work on it

642
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,200
then

643
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
it's probably not going to go anywhere

644
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,840
um

645
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,000
i i

646
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,320
hate to see work that people have done

647
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
you know sort of go to waste

648
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,200
but if that is the state of where we are

649
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,880
with the document and with the interest

650
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,159
of the working group

651
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,760
then you know that's what sometimes

652
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
happens right if there's no interest

653
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,320
there's no interest

654
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,880
so what i think i need to do is

655
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,600
return the document to the working group

656
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,559
and

657
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,240
if or as

658
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,200
you find time to an interest to work on

659
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,120
it then you you can right and and if it

660
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,360
ever comes back

661
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,720
to

662
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,880
me and the aesg then we'll do the

663
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,120
processing at that point but yeah

664
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,840
there's enough

665
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,360
issues outstanding and open right now

666
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
and enough concerns that

667
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,400
that i i can't um

668
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,279
push the document forward

669
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,559
thank you very much alvaro yeah all

670
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,120
right we are here with you so having the

671
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
document to the working group part so we

672
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,200
can address all the issues there

673
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,520
is the way is the right way to proceed

674
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,120
so thank you very much

65 550 i'm sorry um is a classical

689
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,000
quote-unquote distance vector with a

690
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,559
protocol with some

691
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,640
specific adaptation for iot in

692
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,720
particular it's an is appropriate

693
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,840
meaning that there's a sense of

694
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,720
direction in separation

695
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,760
but it's it's a distance vector

696
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,840
family now

697
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,559
there are extreme use cases where it's

698
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,399
probably not what you want

699
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,320
and at one extreme

700
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,480
we can see uh

701
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,320
ripple aodv play that's the pure man a

702
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,679
very

703
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,360
challenging environment where you really

704
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,440
want to establish a little route that

705
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,000
you can use so that's a very extreme use

706
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,799
case

707
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,440
the other extreme use case

708
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,240
is when you you want a

709
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,480
much better tighter control like the

710
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,600
type of

711
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,159
traffic engineering situation

712
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,880
um and this is where the dow projection

713
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,600
plays so you can see it as a

714
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
sdn

715
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,279
variation of ripple

716
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,520
whereas aodv would be a reactive

717
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,000
protocol adaptation of ripple all of

718
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,159
them play with the same messaging the

719
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,399
same basic structures

720
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,640
but they they operate

721
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,559
reactively for iodv

722
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,440
and using um

723
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,120
sdn type controller based routing

724
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,200
for no projection so that's basically

725
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,679
how i would position it

726
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,279
now i built

727
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,600
this slide

728
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,279
the sake of

729
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,679
positioning the different things that we

730
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,960
manipulate with this document

731
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,760
and how it it builds on what ripple did

732
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,440
in the past

733
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
so

734
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,799
first thing there are two kinds of

735
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,120
frauds that their projection can install

736
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,640
inside the network

737
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,840
what

738
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,760
the first type is what i would call a

739
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,880
segment

740
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,600
and it's a serial link it's serial

741
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,399
set of hubs and that's what happens

742
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,880
with a project down which is sent by the

743
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,200
root to forwarding node g which is one

744
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,840
of those black nodes on the top

745
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,360
and the the p down will follow the path

746
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,200
on the reverse direction of the packet

747
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,840
which is true for redid

748
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
and

749
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,960
the the p diode contains that path so it

750
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,520
will basically say a to f to g it is

751
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,240
sent to g it goes all the way back this

752
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,039
path and a which is the ingress will

753
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,720
send the pedal back

754
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,799
to the root and with this we have built

755
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,720
a serial segment that's what we call a

756
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,480
segment

757
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,120
but now one more question sorry a

758
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
segment one should have the ingress

759
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,279
included or not necessarily

760
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,840
segments as an ingress and an egress so

761
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,000
i i should i could have written

762
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,919
uh that a is the ingress of that

763
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,120
particular segment okay

764
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,600
but it's it's it's our naming right i

765
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,960
mean because a segment by itself if it's

766
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,600
if it has a track id for itself it's

767
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,840
already a track but it's just a serial

768
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,799
path

769
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,760
um

770
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,000
normally it's just it's more of a

771
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,960
component of a larger structure

772
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,720
and that larger structure is what we

773
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,640
call a track

774
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
and we build a track by

775
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,760
putting together a number of track legs

776
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,880
and in this in this drawing i have three

777
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,559
track legs

778
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,559
one that goes from egress they are they

779
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,640
all go from egress to egress right in

780
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,159
grass to egress

781
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,480
it's it's a path that you establish with

782
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,760
a non-stirring pidang

783
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,200
and it it pro it provides a uh

784
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,960
loose

785
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,880
uh source right path

786
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,440
between grass and grass and you can see

787
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,760
the first leg is from i to a a to f f to

788
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,480
g g to e and and through that you can

789
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,640
reach the targets ti's

790
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,240
so that's the upper

791
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,559
leg then you have a middle leg which

792
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,679
goes from i to a a to b

793
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,519
b to e and then you can reach the

794
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,360
targets again

795
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,440
what's interesting in this second leg is

796
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,519
the path between a and b

797
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,679
is actually another track

798
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,559
so it's it is itself a track for which a

799
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,760
is ingress

800
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,559
and b is a grass

801
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,640
okay so so a has to re-encapsulate if

802
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,919
you like see that's a terminal

803
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,679
uh but it's it's more complex than now

804
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,120
because for instance the track that you

805
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,360
see between the i and e has three legs

806
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,880
in it

807
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,039
and the last leg is i to b to e

808
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,559
oh by the way um

809
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,120
i say i to b to e i so that i should

810
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,440
have said i to a to e b four but it was

811
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,760
just to differentiate that i was going

812
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,640
uh

813
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,799
via the top so basically when you when

814
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,039
you establish a non-storing loose path

815
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,080
you just

816
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,840
provide what we call the relay in this

817
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,039
picture which are the nodes uh which are

818
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,600
which appear in the source route so the

819
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,640
source route says for instance to go

820
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,760
i to a to e there is a pedal one of

821
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,600
those great pedal on the left which is

822
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,200
set by the root

823
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,799
to increase

824
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,080
i

825
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,679
and the main route the root of the

826
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,440
meteor deck and it says source rod path

827
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,559
is

828
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,918
i to a to e

829
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,440
and a will have a segment to go to e

830
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,080
that will allow it to

831
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
forward towards e but the source rod

832
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,320
pass will just say a to e and that will

833
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,080
in fact imply that you go through the

834
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,678
segment which is fge

835
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,320
okay so a track leg is a loose source

836
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,159
route serial path

837
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,440
between the loose hubs you get segments

838
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,600
and the track is the aggregation of

839
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,279
multiple of those legs

840
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,960
each leg go from ingress to egress

841
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,840
so

842
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,480
this is what i wanted to illustrate

843
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,799
in this uh drawing so you see the

844
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,279
targets that you can reach are those

845
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,159
green

846
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,960
ti's on the right to the set of t1 t2 tn

847
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,679
the legs there are three of them iae

848
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,720
which which is advertised as one

849
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,240
non-storing model with the targets ti

850
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,760
second leg is

851
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,720
l2

852
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,519
which goes from ib

853
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,159
e and that's the lower leg again it's

854
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,559
the source rod pulse going to ti and the

855
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,519
last leg is the one that goes across

856
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,159
i a b e and that one actually

857
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,960
re-encapsulates another track between a

858
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,039
and b

859
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,320
sorry thank you uh so from subtracts we

860
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,960
can have segments and legs as well right

861
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,239
well

862
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,079
we can decide our wording but for now

863
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,399
i have written it such a way that the

864
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,960
subtract is like a track it goes from

865
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,119
it goes from the ingress to the egress

866
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,280
so it's only it's any aggre it's any

867
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,918
composition of legs

868
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,560
so so the the track between a and b is

869
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,079
not a subtract

870
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,918
because it's it's it's

871
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,839
what we say in the language is we place

872
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,000
the bucket on one subtract

873
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,839
and what it really means is you place it

874
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,440
on one more legs between i and e

875
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,280
so

876
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,359
just to be able to use the language

877
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,399
easily

878
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,719
uh right now the text uses subtract as

879
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,079
just any subset of the legs

880
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,240
of the track

881
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
and that's because when you do row using

882
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,480
this you will not place the packet on

883
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,000
all the legs in parallel because that

884
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,160
would consume too much energy you will

885
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,680
select a subset

886
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
of the legs and place the packet on that

887
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
subset so you will get redundancy but

888
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,320
you will not waste too much energy

889
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,119
so so that's why the subtracts are any

890
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,480
subsets

891
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,240
uh so any set

892
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,160
which is a subset of the track and the

893
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,319
track itself is the set of legs

894
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,040
okay so the track is really

895
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,440
the set l1 l2 s3

896
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,599
and the subtracts are any subset of that

897
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,520
but empty sets because you cannot route

898
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,160
on the empty set

899
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,520
so it's just

900
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,720
i mean

901
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,320
the language that that we used and the

902
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,800
objects that we're constructing so this

903
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,960
is ripple meaning that we are building a

904
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,800
diode between i

905
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,160
and e

906
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,480
uh the deodag as root which is i

907
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,560
it's actually reversible giving you a

908
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,680
deal dag which root is e by the way

909
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,440
and if the links are reversible the

910
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,640
other will be if the links are not

911
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,000
reversible because they are not really

912
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,359
symmetrical then

913
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,520
you use any in one direction

914
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,079
and the the the track you can see

915
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,839
globally from the external view has a

916
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,119
tunnel between

917
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,640
i and e

918
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,800
and effectively if you follow rfc 9008

919
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,200
you'll find that the targets are

920
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,800
external routes based on all

921
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,040
destinations for this geodec just like

922
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
ripple on their leaves if you like

923
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
and so the the encapsulation when you

924
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,599
reach ingress will be exactly what 900

925
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,560
tells you

926
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,160
so the increase has to encapsulate

927
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,839
towards the egress which is the sixth

928
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,560
hour serving the 600 watts those ripple

929
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,400
newer leaves and then the crest

930
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,599
encapsulates

931
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,280
and um

932
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,040
and and delivers to a target so this is

933
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,320
looking from a distance this is a

934
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,560
classical ripple geodag where the

935
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,119
targets are external destinations

936
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,320
and the ingress is the root

937
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,560
and then and the raw problem is if you

938
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,480
if you look at if you consider the raw

939
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,640
working group the raw problem is to

940
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,720
avoid completely flooding this graph

941
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,240
which would mean too much spectrum too

942
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
much energy

943
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
when you want to reach from i to e if

944
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,000
you flood completely this graph yes you

945
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,400
have the highest possible reliability

946
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,320
but you also consume a lot of energy and

947
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,440
bandwidth

948
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,920
spectrum and since energy and spectrum

949
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,119
are scarce

950
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,440
the row prime will be to select a subset

951
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,520
of l1 l2 l3 for each packet

952
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,800
um i'm also summarizing uh some rules of

953
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,480
how all this work

954
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
works so the track is set up by

955
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,079
distilling legs and segments and the

956
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,920
legs go from the ingress to egress and

957
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,960
the segments uh basically fill the gap

958
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,440
between the loose hops so the segments

959
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,200
are serial hops

960
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,920
the packet gets in a segment hop and

961
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,400
gets out in the same fashion there is no

962
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,839
processing on it but forwarding

963
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,119
non-stirring mode pedal are used to

964
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,040
signal the legs so it's a source rod

965
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,280
path storing mode pedal is used to

966
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,800
signal a segment

967
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,440
it is a serial there is no loose it has

968
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,960
to be completely up by your biop

969
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,839
the fact that we have the segments so we

970
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,400
have the storing mode that enables

971
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,000
the non-storing

972
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,520
to be loose actually it's because we

973
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
complete the gaps with the story that we

974
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,599
can have non-storing loops and in

975
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,280
particular we can leverage that in the

976
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,880
main geodag

977
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,680
to enable non-storing mode

978
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,720
ripple

979
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,119
to have loose source route so you

980
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,760
basically can install segments in the

981
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,040
main geodag

982
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,440
so that your packets will have a shorter

983
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,359
source rotator

984
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,680
and obviously the segments are also used

985
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,119
inside the tracks

986
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,599
uh and and then that allows you to again

987
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,800
to specify your leg as a loose uh

988
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,839
sequence of hops

989
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,000
there is this rule in the document which

990
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
we could discuss but it seemed to be the

991
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
most useful way of doing things

992
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,240
the tracking grass is implicitly a

993
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,880
target when you do no starring mode

994
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,000
you think that uh basically normally you

995
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,680
the stone starting mode installs this

996
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,160
quarter leg this tunnel between the

997
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,000
ingress and egress

998
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,760
well in your routing table you will say

999
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,839
that the egress is reachable by that it

1000
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,560
makes sense

1001
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,079
okay

1002
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,720
okay status of the draft

1003
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,960
and the other rules you can read them

1004
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,920
so we've published 24 21 was a huge

1005
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,760
review by taurus i can never thank you

1006
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,320
enough but we discussed that the atf 12

1007
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,800
huge restructuration because taurus 3

1008
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,200
came from outside of the of the group

1009
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,400
and so he asked for more restructuration

1010
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,320
to help the first time reader et cetera

1011
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,680
et cetera so we did that huge

1012
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,480
restructuration and also also good

1013
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,560
technical points then we had michael's

1014
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,520
review

1015
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,839
and then again it went kind of deep

1016
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,880
terminology clarification

1017
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,280
uh also mapping to that net uh which is

1018
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,760
the relay nodes are the the hops

1019
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,680
the loose ups and the forwarding nodes

1020
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,000
that's that terminology are the hubs in

1021
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,839
the segments one in one out

1022
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,880
then we have 23 with liz review and like

1023
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,560
i said we have those three very deep

1024
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,880
reviews very happy with them

1025
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,359
and lee some of his his questions were

1026
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,440
easy to answer so kind of did it with

1027
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,200
version 23 but then there are four

1028
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,280
issues if you remember that we discussed

1029
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,040
at an interim which were harder

1030
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,800
so we we discussed the four issues on

1031
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,040
the list and i published basically the

1032
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,520
result as 24.

1033
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,560
so my my view is that 24 fixes all the

1034
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,760
the kitab issues one of them was how

1035
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,560
many targets you can have in the dao

1036
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,359
and uh lee wanted more than one but

1037
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,680
how can the controller reach more than

1038
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,760
one maybe it can maybe it cannot maybe

1039
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,280
the path that would reach them all is

1040
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,200
not as good and there are policies in

1041
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,880
play and we did not want to enter that

1042
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,760
game

1043
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,920
so what i said is okay to have multiple

1044
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,440
targets but

1045
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,760
um we we guarantee you need to reach the

1046
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,040
first one in order and then the the

1047
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,480
controller will do its best to reach

1048
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,079
also the others but it really depends on

1049
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,440
what can do

1050
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,200
but then there are um

1051
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
more uh

1052
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,520
discussion about the federation flag in

1053
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,760
the sau is a link between two siblings

1054
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,200
the actual or not

1055
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,359
which was introduced for lease review on

1056
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,839
23 and and the text was improved on 24.

1057
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,920
uh since then we have uh done some

1058
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,560
rephrasing on legs and subtracts which

1059
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,920
is uh basically what we just discussed

1060
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,599
um

1061
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,599
i've i had to publish it i could publish

1062
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,680
it now so so we can review that those

1063
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,280
changes they are minor but it's just to

1064
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
clarify the terminology so we can really

1065
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,359
speak about your checks

1066
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,440
and we were waiting for him saris review

1067
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,200
which did not come i mean the request is

1068
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,400
a lot of work

1069
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,480
but i don't think blocks were good plus

1070
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,839
call because we had all those three

1071
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,359
reviews like michael

1072
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,160
uh tell us at the end so that was

1073
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,079
since when world cup let's go start and

1074
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,079
everything i would hope people to

1075
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,440
uh look in that

1076
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
if we want new stages to be more

1077
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,040
specific and stuff

1078
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,800
uh with our flows that they have in mind

1079
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,160
that we missed in particular fields

1080
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,760
there is there is discussion on all this

1081
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,160
but if if people think we are missing

1082
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,319
that would be good

1083
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,040
that's it for me

1084
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,759
thank you

1085
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,880
comment questions

1086
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,800
okay thank you very much pascal we go to

1087
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,800
michael

1088
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,240
now you have control

1089
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,640
do i

1090
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,560
deck

1091
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,760
yeah

1092
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,880
okay

1093
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,720
i just the first time with my with the

1094
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,960
phone you see so there you go okay so um

1095
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,480
uh this document has been did we even

1096
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,160
get as far as working group last call

1097
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,000
and then we stopped again i can't

1098
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,680
remember but um

1099
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,720
uh

1100
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,560
back and forth but that's the story so

1101
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,720
far you see that work there we go

1102
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,599
um so um

1103
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,079
we got quite far uh we merged in another

1104
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,319
document uh with a different metric last

1105
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,520
year

1106
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,640
um and we had a lot of discussions about

1107
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,319
this and then

1108
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,240
uh conrad observed that uh this new

1109
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,480
extension uh interacts poorly with the

1110
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,160
trickle timer

1111
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,280
and

1112
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,720
so then we had a lot of conversation

1113
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,440
back and forth and we settled on

1114
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,920
the proposal that the value would not

1115
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,280
change throughout the dodge

1116
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,720
and so the route would be able to set

1117
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,440
the value the preference for that doday

1118
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,520
and it would it would uh

1119
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,359
there's a word for spread throughout the

1120
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,119
dodge that i forget

1121
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,200
it will propagate through the dough dag

1122
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,119
and that will be it if the root wants to

1123
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,400
change it

1124
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,240
it would need to you know increment the

1125
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,119
dtsm or something like that to reset the

1126
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,640
trickle timer

1127
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,680
um and so we kind of uh reluct i was

1128
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,760
reluctant with that change but i'm like

1129
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,560
okay i guess that's the right answer um

1130
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,800
it it's a compromise

1131
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,560
um and rule and said well actually that

1132
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,880
just doesn't satisfy his need for it all

1133
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,520
i think that we can solve it i think

1134
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,960
that we agreed we could solve this

1135
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,720
problem by adding another lollipop

1136
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,960
counter to this extension

1137
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,119
and that is essentially what i think

1138
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,480
that we're going to be doing it just

1139
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,720
hasn't been done yet

1140
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,040
um

1141
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,160
so

1142
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,680
that was the kind of things that we had

1143
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,599
discussion about

1144
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,000
um i think that the new counter solves

1145
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,400
the problem um i'm going to put that

1146
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,040
into the next revision of the document

1147
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,240
um

1148
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,319
i don't feel i don't feel that confident

1149
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,760
about the whole thing until i've

1150
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,200
actually written some code about it

1151
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,680
which is for me won't be very soon

1152
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,400
so i would really appreciate uh some

1153
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,160
more deep review particularly if you

1154
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,079
have writing code

1155
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,760
um

1156
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,920
i don't think that we'll finish the

1157
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,640
the this this needs some effort and i

1158
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,160
think we've talked with the milestones

1159
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,760
sometime at the end of the year this

1160
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,319
will be ready and i said summer

1161
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,960
i think that's still feasible

1162
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,760
um that's really it discussion

1163
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,839
um if if you if you have questions about

1164
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,440
what is going on i have some other

1165
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,520
slides we can talk to but we only have

1166
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,359
15 minutes left so i don't want to spend

1167
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,920
a lot of time of that if

1168
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,839
if not any other questions from the

1169
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,000
group

1170
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:24,800
pardon

1171
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,520
yes

1172
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,560
in the queue

1173
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,480
oh go ahead please

1174
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,280
yeah i was one of the proponents of uh

1175
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,240
fixing the minimum priority at the root

1176
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,640
because uh i hope i demonstrated on the

1177
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,839
mailing list through a number of

1178
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,839
arguments that it just could not work

1179
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,720
the way it was specified because you

1180
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,160
for one example you would get different

1181
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,240
values from different parents and stuff

1182
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,480
like that and also there was the policy

1183
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,560
to say how you would increment it so the

1184
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,240
the notes could increment in any fashion

1185
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,480
and that was really weird

1186
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,800
uh i think the the

1187
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,359
lollipop is much needed we want it uh

1188
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,680
the reason why it's much needed is

1189
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,160
because you might receive

1190
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,040
uh

1191
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,839
values which are older from some parents

1192
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,119
than others and you want to know which

1193
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,800
is the latest one

1194
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,640
it doesn't really fix the prime that it

1195
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,599
does not balance the dag

1196
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,599
but another argument was whatever was

1197
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,000
proposed there did not fix it either and

1198
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,920
balancing the graph is a very difficult

1199
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,359
problem but it won't be fixed uh by just

1200
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,160
the value that gets incremented uh down

1201
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,200
the geoduck like this

1202
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,880
if you look at it it's a global problem

1203
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,040
and it it has to be

1204
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,839
well

1205
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,839
i looked at it deeply the only way i

1206
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,680
found to fix it is to look at it from

1207
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,960
the outside from a controller

1208
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,839
perspective uh it's it's it's a very

1209
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,440
hard prime to balance something in the

1210
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,839
distributed fashion basically

1211
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:48,559
so

1212
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,559
there's so there's the thing that i care

1213
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,240
about um which is a is a less pro lower

1214
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,680
property or than balancing the graph

1215
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,040
which is that

1216
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,079
um nodes don't try to enroll in parts of

1217
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,200
the graph

1218
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,800
which have no capacity to support them

1219
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,359
so i i think that that that it does

1220
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,079
solve that problem right

1221
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,079
no what's so well

1222
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,040
at the end the draft has but not not

1223
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,240
changing the priority down the diu

1224
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,359
what prevents the note to join is the

1225
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,119
priority we put in the beacon right so

1226
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,480
the question is how do you map the

1227
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,200
priority into the beacon

1228
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,880
now

1229
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,240
so so

1230
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,599
it could be done

1231
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,839
we could work on how

1232
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,640
basically uh someone could could tell

1233
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,440
that

1234
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,520
and maybe we need another value to say

1235
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,280
something like that like the parent

1236
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,040
would say below me i don't want anybody

1237
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,079
or something

1238
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,119
uh but th this will this will take new

1239
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,960
work because for instance do you want

1240
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,880
nobody because of amount of traffic do

1241
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,640
you want and and in which case the

1242
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,640
solution could be slow down the traffic

1243
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,240
or do you want nobody because you don't

1244
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,640
have storage mode resources well most of

1245
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,800
us are not doing story mode

1246
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,359
um or do you want to do it because you

1247
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,800
don't have enough done story mode

1248
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,280
resources where non-storyboard resources

1249
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,839
are really to your children not down the

1250
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,880
gear deck so you don't need for that to

1251
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,599
to control what goes beyond you in the

1252
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,119
dear dark you just need to control your

1253
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,559
own neighbor cash

1254
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,079
and and for that

1255
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,720
your beacon is enough

1256
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,480
you can you can manipulate your own

1257
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,480
beacon to protect your own neighbor cash

1258
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,280
i agree with you that's true yeah and

1259
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,119
for the for the children of yourself

1260
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,720
it's not your concern

1261
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,920
because that does not affect your

1262
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,760
resources it just affects the support

1263
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,280
that you get through

1264
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,559
and now the question if of the

1265
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,000
throughput that you get through is yet

1266
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,359
another balancing which is not

1267
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,079
necessarily related to the children

1268
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,680
right some children can speak more than

1269
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,480
others etc so it's it's it's it's a lot

1270
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,400
more complex than than

1271
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,200
than what the draft seem to enter

1272
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,960
and and so let's keep the draft simple

1273
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,400
that's what he's doing well

1274
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,400
which is not storing if you haven't been

1275
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,640
cash prime fix your beacon

1276
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,000
um

1277
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,319
and if you have a throughput prime

1278
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,240
like i said it's probably a more global

1279
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,079
brand than this and for now is flood

1280
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,319
control so pascal you prefer the

1281
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,480
document as it is right now

1282
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,640
where we've changed it so that you don't

1283
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,880
change the value from the root

1284
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,640
you don't need a new law

1285
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,119
do do we still need a new lollipop

1286
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,400
counter

1287
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,440
i think we do my memory of that is all

1288
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,480
right uh is what conrad said is probably

1289
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,160
that you may get different information

1290
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,319
from different parents if you want to

1291
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,960
make sure which one is the freshest all

1292
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,520
right so is is our four bits enough

1293
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,400
i

1294
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,680
hope so right

1295
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,200
yeah so if

1296
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,440
if we use the traditional uh

1297
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,280
lollipop that we have in section seven

1298
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,200
of 65.50 yeah then we need a eight by

1299
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,960
eight bits right

1300
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,280
uh but do we want that or just do we

1301
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,240
just want a a rotation of in which case

1302
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,119
the rotation inside is is four bits

1303
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,119
well so i think the question is are we

1304
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,720
going to steal some bits from some other

1305
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,520
part

1306
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,680
of the extension or are we going to add

1307
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,520
another bite that's really the the two

1308
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,760
choices right well if you want to have a

1309
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,480
very simple specification

1310
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,000
uh

1311
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,520
you should have one bite because then

1312
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,119
you can just say what we say everywhere

1313
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,119
else just look at section seven

1314
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,640
all right well that's what i'll probably

1315
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,079
say that's what i'll propose in o5 then

1316
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,920
and um

1317
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,079
uh with that i think i'm done are you

1318
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,839
any other other comments from other

1319
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,839
people

1320
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,040
okay

1321
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,079
so

1322
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,800
i wonder how i turn it off

1323
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,319
well i guess i'll let ninez do that

1324
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,319
i did

1325
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,558
okay

1326
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
okay thank you very much michael

1327
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,200
so basically we will need a lollipop and

1328
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,920
then check section 7

1329
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,720
for

1330
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,480
knowing how to do that

1331
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,079
some additional comments questions

1332
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,400
okay

1333
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,599
have some implementations

1334
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:20,400
okay

1335
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,160
some are willing to implement

1336
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,359
comments

1337
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,000
on this one

1338
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,240
okay anyway i think there are people

1339
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,319
that was in the middle east that is not

1340
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,280
today

1341
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,920
participating so i think we will receive

1342
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
more comments on this work mainly

1343
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,319
because as well affects his teach

1344
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,240
work

1345
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,839
okay thank you

1346
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,319
uh pascal

1347
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,240
you should

1348
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,879
be next

1349
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,559
yes

1350
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,200
so i guess it is

1351
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,760
probably time to start working on this

1352
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,480
document in this group

1353
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,400
so just to give you some some context

1354
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,839
about

1355
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,839
what this is and some of you i've have

1356
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,000
heard about it many times

1357
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,400
so the series of therapies which

1358
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,640
represent the adaptation of

1359
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,520
ipv6 nepa discovery initially for the

1360
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,599
context of iot and now it has grown way

1361
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,640
beyond

1362
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,800
uh there are it's it's used in in reef

1363
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,520
to choose in a ripple it's used it's

1364
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,079
proposing evpn

1365
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,520
so basically

1366
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,040
what this series of rfc do is is enabled

1367
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,319
to register

1368
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,720
a node between an address between a host

1369
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,079
and a router

1370
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,200
and

1371
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,200
ask the router to to

1372
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,839
redistribute that address in the routing

1373
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,839
protocol of the day that can be vpn that

1374
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,920
can be a ripple that can be whatever the

1375
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,440
cool thing is that the signaling is

1376
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,880
cryptically abstract to the routing that

1377
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,880
takes place so you can have any routing

1378
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,559
protocol or both

1379
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,800
uh it's still a simple registration with

1380
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,839
the same format exactly by the

1381
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,359
host well i say exactly that there is a

1382
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,880
back field where you can still pass some

1383
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,559
hints to the specific routing protocol

1384
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,800
if you need to but otherwise it's

1385
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,559
basically a routing agnostic uh

1386
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,400
registration that we have

1387
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,400
so this registration was initially for

1388
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,640
only addresses

1389
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,559
but

1390
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,319
we are now with this draft we are

1391
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,760
proposing to

1392
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,040
to extend it to any cast and multicast

1393
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,400
address

1394
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,599
so

1395
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,000
for multicast we already had a ribbon

1396
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,480
counterpart with a mob 3

1397
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,160
yes and

1398
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,000
that was pretty much a mix of storing

1399
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,319
mode and multicast

1400
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,640
but we we don't have anything for

1401
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,040
non-storing mode which appears to be

1402
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,960
uh the

1403
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,960
most important uh

1404
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,839
case for the actual ripple deployments

1405
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,280
so part of what this thing does is

1406
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,400
extend uh 855 as i said for any cast and

1407
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,720
multicast which which the sixth floor

1408
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,720
working group has been looking at

1409
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,559
and so far i mean we have discussions

1410
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,319
and no objections so we i think we're

1411
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,160
pretty good there and then we did the

1412
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,720
ripple counter part in the one hand is

1413
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,640
to extend uh the reaper and wear leaf

1414
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,040
draft rfc now

1415
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,200
to inject any cast and multicast on top

1416
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,200
of unicast but also extend ripple itself

1417
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,440
because if the story the

1418
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,920
geoduck is operating non-storing mode

1419
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,240
we could effectively uh

1420
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,880
leverage that as well for multicast

1421
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,960
using basically a distribution uh

1422
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,280
set of set of tunnels

1423
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,400
using

1424
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,119
eight zero zero eight but across a

1425
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,680
collection of tunnels both just one so

1426
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,440
basically distributing a crosstal at the

1427
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,400
root

1428
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,000
which is what we are proposing with this

1429
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,520
map five

1430
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,280
so as you see out of those three points

1431
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,160
here the last two are really a constant

1432
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,040
for raw as opposed to six low

1433
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,319
six loaded

1434
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,480
is pretty much done with that f505 we

1435
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,440
need to look at the extension to 1910

1436
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,680
and to 65.50

1437
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,640
um so what happened to this draft

1438
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,839
during the atf 112 we we worked on

1439
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,240
cleaning the

1440
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,079
the description of the anycast support

1441
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,640
and improving the backward compatibility

1442
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,280
uh pretty much with in 1910

1443
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,720
and also

1444
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,520
in the sixth law context the eda edac

1445
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,000
exchange had to carry the new flags that

1446
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,359
were introducing to say any customer

1447
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,520
multiples

1448
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,079
since then we we made uh we bumped the

1449
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,880
version to from two to four

1450
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,880
so we looked at uh some concerns some

1451
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,040
feedback we got from weissel actually so

1452
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,079
ysun one one plans to use this work and

1453
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,119
they're pressing us to deliver it

1454
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,480
um

1455
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,400
one issue they had was with the whole

1456
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,920
node multicastly scope group

1457
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,200
ffo2 com com1 and they did not want the

1458
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,359
nodes to have to register to it because

1459
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,839
in normal ipv6 this is implicit

1460
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,160
there was no text saying yes or no so we

1461
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,799
clarified that yes you don't need

1462
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,040
you do not need to register to this this

1463
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,839
is implicit

1464
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:14,640
um then we improve the description of uh

1465
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,319
how address protection works in that

1466
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,200
case

1467
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,960
for multicast and any caskets

1468
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,000
and we also align the description with

1469
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,400
the work which is proposed at best to

1470
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,400
redistribute

1471
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,160
eight five four five and now this new

1472
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,559
work multicast and any cast as well into

1473
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,839
bgp into a vpn

1474
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,200
um

1475
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,000
so the workforce for this group is uh

1476
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,920
manifold but mostly we have to look at

1477
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,720
mob five we manage the collision with

1478
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,880
ripple aodv right which is now four so

1479
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,119
we we have five

1480
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,000
um

1481
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,319
but now we consider whether it's okay to

1482
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,960
do the ingress replication has proposed

1483
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,119
and uh

1484
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,880
basically the draft also describes how

1485
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,799
you do you select one of the possible

1486
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,720
destinations for any cast

1487
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,680
and with this i'm out of my time

1488
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,799
so i won't describe much unless you tell

1489
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,319
me i have more time

1490
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,240
yeah

1491
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,200
so

1492
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,280
so i'll skip on this slide which gives

1493
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,359
you the the most interesting aspect of

1494
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:23,558
the document and we'll take questions

1495
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,280
basically my ask is for you alvaro and

1496
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,599
eric klein actually

1497
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,480
if you could work together on how we

1498
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,839
we do this document

1499
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,160
because it it makes sense for me to keep

1500
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,480
it as one because you specify both sides

1501
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,680
and now you have a complete story

1502
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,760
um sure i'll go over the thumbnail

1503
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,799
so i'm going to delegate that to

1504
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:53,040
our chairs to go talk to the six load

1505
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,000
chairs

1506
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,359
and then figure out um

1507
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:58,559
figure that out right whether we have

1508
00:58:58,559 --> 00:58:59,920
two documents that depends on each other

1509
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,520
or one point to the other or whatever

1510
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,480
that is

1511
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
or we work on one

1512
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,079
if we work on one we need to figure out

1513
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,079
who's going to last call it who owns the

1514
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,520
decision

1515
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,440
uh et cetera but i think you know this

1516
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,839
is a working group uh thing so uh in

1517
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,480
essen dominica you can please talk to

1518
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,040
the six law chairs that would be great i

1519
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,680
will give eric klein a heads up anyways

1520
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,839
so that you know we're all aware

1521
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:26,480
uh on what's going on there you have

1522
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,880
talked about all this in sixth law right

1523
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,280
yes was there it was middle of the night

1524
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,400
for him

1525
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,520
so so

1526
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,440
but he was there

1527
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,960
and and it's not the first time right so

1528
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,079
you're not aware now as the sgs as they

1529
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,760
as she even if you delegate do you have

1530
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,520
a preference like do you want to see two

1531
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,839
documents coming

1532
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:47,200
asynchronously um do you think that

1533
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,280
there is a risk that one document misses

1534
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,960
an aspect and then the other has to

1535
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,880
correctly oh i don't have a preference

1536
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,559
um no

1537
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,000
again you know this depends on what is

1538
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,280
going to go into each of the two

1539
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,480
documents

1540
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,079
and how much you know related they have

1541
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,119
to be

1542
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,559
and whether they are two at the same

1543
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,640
time or two at different times

1544
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,040
uh it depends on the implementation and

1545
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,040
other statuses so no i don't have a

1546
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,319
preference on how you do it

1547
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,240
uh alvaro also in in six low if it was

1548
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,480
two documents it wasn't clear i think to

1549
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,280
six low that that other doctrine and six

1550
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,000
low actually fit their charter

1551
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
so that was one of the actual arguments

1552
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,319
for i think for for having it one

1553
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,000
document somewhere

1554
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,920
not in six low was that they weren't

1555
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,359
sure if they're even fit in sigflow

1556
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,119
uh right so again you know something

1557
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,000
that i think the the chairs

1558
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,760
in that case about their charter with

1559
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,119
eric you need to figure out if it's in

1560
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,400
charter or not

1561
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,200
um

1562
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,880
you know we have all kinds of documents

1563
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,480
that span multiple working groups all

1564
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,680
the time we do this in best in bgp and

1565
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,520
now even pim and other working groups

1566
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,280
where that happens all the time and we

1567
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,680
just agree on how

1568
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,480
the document is going to be processed

1569
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,359
um

1570
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,280
where it's you know usually last call in

1571
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,319
one place

1572
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:05,839
copied to the other one where we need to

1573
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,760
get consensus from both

1574
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,040
but there's a set of chairs that are

1575
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,400
going to own this

1576
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,200
so

1577
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,440
yeah the charter issue is an issue i'll

1578
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,680
i'll talk to eric about that

1579
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,000
but at the same time i'll keep you and s

1580
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,079
and dominique in the loop on that and

1581
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,000
and please talk to

1582
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,520
the six door chairs about it sure

1583
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,920
my hint is that the changes to six lower

1584
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,240
minor we are basically adding some flags

1585
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,559
to say any cast amount of cast

1586
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,640
the big work is on ripple side

1587
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,359
just like you know 9 10 90 10.

1588
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,280
so my end is probably

1589
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,520
raw is a better place but not just me

1590
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,920
okay

1591
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,520
okay thank you very much um

1592
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,839
we will discuss uh with the six law

1593
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,920
chairs uh we are running out of

1594
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,440
committee minutes

1595
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,880
so we are going to send the conclusions

1596
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,240
in the mailing list

1597
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,960
and trigger the corresponding

1598
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,400
threads

1599
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,200
and the meaning some other commands

1600
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,680
yeah i will definitely work with the six

1601
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,598
load chairs and sort that out no worries

1602
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,720
there is a comment

1603
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,839
in the chat atman rashid

1604
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:26,640
uh

1605
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,280
that is like are not both protocols

1606
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,599
dependent uh to each other i mean

1607
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,680
representing japan carson replace not

1608
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,759
okay some additional common questions

1609
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,799
uh michael barger issue a red issue in

1610
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,960
your slide but we can take the main list

1611
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,240
because we are out of time

1612
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,680
okay

1613
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,839
adnan do you want to say

1614
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:56,640
lots and comments

1615
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,119
um okay

1616
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,359
i think we can conclude the meeting if

1617
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:06,960
there is

1618
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,799
no additional comment questions

1619
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,839
okay thank you very much all have a nice

1620
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,839
day

1621
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,400
you hi very much

1622
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,079
your help

1623
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,520
thank you very much big thanks mike

1624
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,599
feels like we should have like a big

1625
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,599
button on the meat echo for the room

1626
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,039
that says

1627
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,680
we're really done now

1628
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,559
like it seems to figure out that we've

1629
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,400
left but i guess does that mean the

1630
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,720
chairs left
