we have rules governing our

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,600
participation uh these the ones here are

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
mainly related to

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,520
uh intellectual property

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,119
um and basically anything you say here

25
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,119
it becomes part of our permanent record

26
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,000
this session is being recorded um

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
everything you contribute at the iepf

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,360
whether by email comment um even uh well

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,600
everything's up private conversations um

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,720
uh

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
come under

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,920
the rules

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
published here if you're not familiar

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,479
with it please go to that link

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
similarly we have

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,520
a code of conduct which

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,360
basically says please treat everyone

38
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,720
with respect

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,439
and

40
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,079
be professional in your interactions

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,479
we're midweek so i think the folks in

42
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,800
the room are probably really familiar

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,239
with how to handle the in-room

44
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,319
participation

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,920
there is the meat echo tool for the mic

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,120
cue it does help us out if you

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,080
use it

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
but if you don't luis is in the room and

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
he'll help us manage the queue

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,160
uh remote participants um

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,360
you know we're

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,680
we're experts at doing remote meetings

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,440
at this point given the last couple of

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,239
years

55
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,920
uh

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,120
uh the blue sheets are fairly automatic

57
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,239
um although there is uh a requirement

58
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,080
for everyone in the room to sign the

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
blue sheet through the meat echo tool

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,400
please do that uh for our note taking we

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360
are continuing to use our collaborative

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,000
uh

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,040
tools

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,319
and please join us there i did drop the

65
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,159
link in the chat

66
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
so that it's easy to just go click on um

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
it's also there's also links in the

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
upper right hand corner of your screen

69
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,239
for those on uh

70
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,560
echo

71
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,560
we have a pretty tight agenda um i'm not

72
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,879
sure we need to go through anything this

73
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,560
is published uh i don't believe there's

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
been any recent changes on it so

75
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
uh all the material is uploaded uh

76
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
thanks to drew for pointing out that i

77
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
uploaded the wrong slide somehow

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519
but that's all been fixed

79
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,319
so we have no new rfcs since the last

80
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,720
meeting or nothing in the

81
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,519
queue

82
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,000
we do have one document with our a.d

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
and

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,200
we have a

85
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,640
a recent

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,080
adoption poll

87
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
and there were some comments and we're

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
going to move towards

89
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,319
publishing that once the issues are

90
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,920
addressed and

91
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
either directly addressed or captured in

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,640
that document

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
we had one liaison that came in um i

94
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,358
think it was just last week yeah

95
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,519
and um

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,519
it's interesting um

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,720
the

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
uh

99
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
it's from uh

100
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,520
the etsy

101
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
nfv group

102
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,040
um that's interesting there is they

103
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
think that there's some gaps there's a

104
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
document that points to those gaps

105
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,160
gaps in work that we've done

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,360
there's an expectation that

107
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,840
as i read it they are planning

108
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
individuals are planning to come

109
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,199
participate

110
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,520
uh here as well as there and contribute

111
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,199
here that's great

112
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,880
um one

113
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,720
question or comment to our aed

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,199
because this came in via email versus

115
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,840
the formal liaison

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,880
process

117
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
and i don't know if that makes this a

118
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,759
communication or a liaison or how to

119
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,600
handle that but just wanted to give you

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,080
a heads up that this uh seemed to come

121
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,639
outside the process uh i did check and

122
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,320
we do have a liaison relationship with

123
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,919
etsy um not sure why uh

124
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,199
john

125
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,800
yeah do you know offhand who our liaison

126
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,199
manager is um anyway we should find out

127
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,840
who it is and check in with them i think

128
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,039
i believe i looked that up uh but i

129
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,120
don't remember i'm sorry

130
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,759
okay let's uh yeah we'll we'll check in

131
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,919
with them once we figure out who it is

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,759
yeah it didn't seem all that critical

133
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,759
because the information got here they're

134
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,840
not asking for any specific action it

135
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,080
just seemed a little bit out of process

136
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,720
uh and i'm not sure if the i i don't

137
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
really understand the etsy organization

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,160
well enough to say that you know maybe

139
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
it had to do with

140
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,360
the subgroup that it was a subgroup and

141
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,080
not the main group

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
all right well thank you

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
robin

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
uh yes

145
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,960
okay hello uh

146
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,319
in fact this uh in fact

147
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,639
atl has another formal liaison with etsi

148
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,720
so i think this how to response this

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,680
liaison can communicate with the ib

150
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,360
liaison coordinator yeah because you are

151
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,759
according to this rules if there's

152
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,520
another formal liaison there's another

153
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,360
responsibility to respond this

154
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,000
liaison

155
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
that's my some

156
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,160
understanding okay i thought i checked

157
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,080
and i thought there was a

158
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
liaison

159
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
relationship um but either way you know

160
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
we're okay because

161
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,479
number one they're not asking for a

162
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,319
response number two they're saying

163
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,680
they're gonna come to say here which is

164
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,479
good and we've talked listed this under

165
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,479
liaison and communications to cover just

166
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,400
the case where people don't have formal

167
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,319
relationships

168
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,440
but thank you for that uh

169
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,960
uh this is just a reminder that if you

170
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
would like to schedule a virtual interim

171
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,400
to contact the chairs i don't think that

172
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,280

documents the status for each of

205
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
these 18 documents is covered in this

206
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
deck

207
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
like in previous meetings i will not be

208
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
walking through each and

209
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,080
every one of those here i will

210
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,040
however double click on a select view

211
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,399
that uh

212
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,399
the others believe are either ready or

213
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,839
close to ready for working with last

214
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,160
call and dwell on them a little bit more

215
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
for the rest of them you can use uh your

216
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
own pace go through the slides and the

217
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,240
reports that are sent out to the list

218
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
and ask questions if any

219
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,800
um so let me jump to slide seven

220
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,600
uh

221
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,120
this is the enhanced vpn framework

222
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,480
document

223
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,720
a new revision for this was published

224
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
earlier this month and the authors are

225
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,399
saying that the document is

226
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,080
almost ready for last call and are

227
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
requesting further review from the

228
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,959
working group

229
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,120
the latest revision has more details on

230
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
the applicability of service data models

231
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,800
to enhance vpn

232
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,920
and also

233
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,360
it has some text clarifying the

234
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,000
relationship between vtn and nrp

235
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,240
so please do go through it and discuss

236
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,519
on the list if this needs more

237
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,600
clarification

238
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
uh i do hear a q i don't know if it's

239
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,399
just me but um

240
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,399
can you everybody else here okay

241
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,920
or do you

242
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,319
see here

243
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
yeah i'm getting a little echo do i

244
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,120
assume that it's just coming back from

245
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,560
the room

246
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,600
okay

247
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,959
so any questions on this

248
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,680
so let me jump to slide nine

249
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,959
uh this is the pcc use cases document

250
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,800
the authors have completed the pending

251
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,760
items

252
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
and now looking to the working group

253
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,279
decides fate

254
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,880
as stated in the previous meetings the

255
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,959
chairs have decided to take this to last

256
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,079
call so the ask for the working group is

257
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,920
to review this in anticipation of last

258
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
call

259
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,200
so let me go to slide 10.

260
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,360
uh this is 3272 best document uh we have

261
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
had a couple of revisions published

262
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,959
since the last meeting and there seems

263
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,920
to be one more update uh covering aqm

264
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,839
that's ready to be published

265
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,079
uh the editors is saying that he has no

266
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,360
more changes to make and we should

267
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
consider taking this to last call this

268
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
is a fairly large document and uh it

269
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,200
could definitely use some thorough

270
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,360
reviews from the working group so please

271
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
do review it uh

272
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,399
in anticipation of last call

273
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,120
the other document that's ready uh is

274
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,399
on slide 15 okay um this is the young

275
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,200
path computation model

276
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,120
rev 17 was published early in the month

277
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,160
rev18 just got published yesterday the

278
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,600
authors believe they are ready for last

279
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,079
call so please do add it to your list of

280
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,720
drafts to be reviewed uh in anticipation

281
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,399
of uh

282
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,800
working with last call so those are the

283
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,120
drafts that are close to lc and that we

284
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,880
wanted to draw your attention to in this

285
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,079
deck

286
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,560
are there any questions on the status of

287
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,399
these or any other working group

288
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,880
document

289
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,200
i don't see anybody rushing to the mic

290
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
okay that's that's all we have for this

291
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,959
slide deck we can move on to the next

292
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,959
presentation

293
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,320
i believe it's done

294
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,079
yes yes hi i will wake up

295
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,279
which is worrying because it's the

296
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,639
middle of the day here

297
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,320
um hi hi everyone so this is a

298
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,000
relatively

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,480
quick update on the actn applicability

300
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,079
to rpoi

301
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,760
so just a reminder we had some fairly

302
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,920
simple use cases these are sort of

303
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,680
functional components

304
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,839
uh across a specific topology here of

305
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,240
sort of packet over optical networks

306
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,839
in the document or if you've looked at

307
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,680
the latest dot document

308
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,959
the the main diffs really are some

309
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,560
um

310
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,959
reordering of the sections and the

311
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,480
subsections

312
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,680
aligning

313
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,600
some of the content specifically to

314
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,079
agreed scope regarding uh segment

315
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,200
routing t end to end uh more on that a

316
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
little bit later we also added some sort

317
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,800
of technical details around

318
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,040
insta link discovery as part of um

319
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
the poi function

320
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,920
and

321
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,120
we are now

322
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,079
um sort of putting substantive text into

323
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,240
our conclusion section

324
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,959
which is really um the

325
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,320
one of the major outcomes from the

326
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,440
document is is what are the gaps uh if

327
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,199
any um certainly we've had a number of

328
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,760
uh uh new pieces of work that have been

329
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,040
sort of initiated uh from this process

330
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
so that's um that's just making sure

331
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
we've kind of captured

332
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
those requirements uh spun out new

333
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,519
documents rare

334
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,959
required

335
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,360
what we will see

336
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
in the conclusion document really sorry

337
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
in the conclusion section in the

338
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,079
document is discussion on

339
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,440
um the

340
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,560
uh

341
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,279
uh the poi capabilities for sort of

342
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,680
discovering topology

343
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,880
setting up

344
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,959
the links whether it's single domain or

345
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,240
inter domain

346
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,920
providing

347
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,160
capability from sort of the underlay to

348
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,639
the overlay

349
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
network

350
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,279
we've also um as mentioned sort of spun

351
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,279
out some new work that included the

352
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,880
inventory model

353
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,720
uh some specific uh requirements for

354
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
the path computation

355
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,680
across particular technologies

356
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,760
as well as some of the discovery

357
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,680
capabilities that required sort of to

358
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,639
provide

359
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,360
automation when setting up

360
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,600
ipf optical

361
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,120
services

362
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,240
and the sort of the the latest section

363
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,360
or subsection in the conclusion summary

364
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,839
of the document is really related to uh

365
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,360
segment routing

366
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,279
sort of more on that a little bit later

367
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,199
so um where are we then with um our

368
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,440
segment routing discussion well there's

369
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,160
been sort of various uh email

370
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
discussions but but a lot of this

371
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,519
discussions happened on our poi call

372
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,240
and we will um we've had a break on

373
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,399
those but we'll resume those

374
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,959
after ietf113 and

375
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,199
the dates and times for those are at the

376
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,120
end of the presentation

377
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,040
what we're trying to kind of discuss and

378
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,720
establish is how the binding between the

379
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
l3bn

380
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,880
and the srt path can be configured

381
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,120
there's a number of options

382
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,880
that are open here

383
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,480
those are summarized

384
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
on this slide

385
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,279
what we don't want to do of course is

386
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,639
come to conclusions uh offline document

387
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,480
them and then sort of bring them to the

388
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,639
working group so we're really trying to

389
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,279
sort of keep the working group involved

390
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,360
with these discussions

391
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,320
we've

392
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
also uh brought as mentioned we've kind

393
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,279
of discussed this with various uh spring

394
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,320
folks

395
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,120
we were considering sort of presenting

396
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
these in the spring uh working group

397
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,759
session later this week but the agenda

398
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,639
was extremely busy already so that there

399
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,040
really wasn't um sort of an opportunity

400
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,120
to kind of do that in in any great

401
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,440
detail so we need to kind of handle that

402
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,759
uh probably uh continuing that through

403
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,360
email and then maybe inviting some of

404
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,880
those folks to attend our poi core

405
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
but but as mentioned these are sort of

406
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,279
ongoing discussions

407
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,160
another area that that's really sort of

408
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,279
had a

409
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,759
a significant amount of discussion is

410
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,279
regarding sort of our inter-domain link

411
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,680
setups so this is not just sort of

412
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,720
horizontal but it's it's kind of um

413
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,680
vertical as well so this slide here

414
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,079
really shows you almost a process

415
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,720
although it's it makes sense to look at

416
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
the figure when you're reading the

417
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,240
documents a little bit more difficult if

418
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,599
this is the first time you've seen this

419
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,480
figure but essentially the mdsc receives

420
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,439
a request to set up uh either an l2 or

421
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,679
l3 vpn service

422
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,199
uh so the ndse will look at the

423
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,079
requirements and then decide uh what

424
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,559
needs to be done uh and specifically the

425
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,720
order of that to fulfill the service

426
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,039
request that it received so that may

427
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,280
require setting up a new optical

428
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,960
tunnel itself

429
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,039
that would then support um

430
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,919
an ip link or a series of ip links

431
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,960
so then the mdse will have to

432
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,360
send the request to the relevant

433
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
optical pncs going back to that sort of

434
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,120
earlier figure that we had of the

435
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,559
topology

436
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,240
um in order to

437
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,480
uh request that optical tunnel once the

438
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,559
optical tunnel uh has been set up then

439
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,400
the mdsc will wait for confirmation

440
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,559
before it then um

441
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,120
sends a request to the pnc

442
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,520
for uh an optical link on multiple

443
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,000
optical links and and this is all

444
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,679
relatively well

445
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,520
described in detail

446
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,919
in the document so you can kind of walk

447
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,760
through that process

448
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,400
where there's kind of a requirement

449
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,559
either for sort of static

450
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,360
or manually configured information or an

451
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
option to have a

452
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,080
a more dynamic method so this may be

453
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,679
things like once the optical tunnel's

454
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,200
been set up the pnc the physical pnc

455
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,679
uh would then potentially be able to

456
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,919
automatically discover

457
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,679
um that this

458
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,440
optical tunnel has been established

459
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,039
through a sort of an adjacency mechanism

460
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,440
uh and that would be discovered

461
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,720
you're potentially through something

462
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,120
like lldp and therefore you know the new

463
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,679
ip link is configured automatically so

464
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,679
these are kind of the things that we've

465
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,480
been

466
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,240
uh document uh documenting um

467
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,160
in the draft and that

468
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,880
that's been the intention i i guess

469
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,840
what we wanted to do was show how all of

470
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,960
these kind of yang models for

471
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,919
um

472
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,320
actn the optical pnc the the the packet

473
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,200
pnc uh which optical models would use

474
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,280
for the service for the optical tunnel

475
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,440
for the ip link and so on and so forth

476
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,880
how are they combined and what

477
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
mechanisms

478
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,720
mechanisms are available for automation

479
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,520
so the big area that kind of needs uh

480
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,160
further documentation at this point is

481
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,600
once the ip link has been set up by the

482
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
the packet pnc

483
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,080
um how do we then set up the srte path

484
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,600
or if this is already an existing

485
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,880
service that needs to be sort of

486
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,559
optimized or we optimized off to some

487
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,640
kind of failure or protection switching

488
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,679
how do we reroute an existing srt path

489
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,360
um through um a different uh ip link and

490
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,200
that's that's kind of working progress

491
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,360
at the moment

492
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,039
so uh next steps for the document

493
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,280
well those are sort of the two big areas

494
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
really i think that we

495
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,840
need to continue so the srt

496
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,918
discussion as well as some of the um

497
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,760
multi-layer link

498
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
ip setup

499
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,080
these are documented

500
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,360
via various issues in our github

501
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,600
and in fact we've got

502
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
several issues i mean more than several

503
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,600
probably sort of actively around 20

504
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,840
issues most of those are relatively

505
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
minor editorial updates um figure

506
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,520
adaptions etc but uh the

507
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,000
list of issues that you see on on on the

508
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,960
slide here um 83

509
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,159
81 80 78 etc those are kind of the main

510
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,760
issues and as mentioned you know we will

511
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,240
continue to highlight these

512
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,559
to the working group and also

513
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,039
engage with some of the spring folks

514
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,960
we will resume our attn poi calls

515
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,760
from march 29th i believe uh we've had

516
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,480
to have two calls uh as as we've kind of

517
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,520
uh

518
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,000
mentioned previously because we've got

519
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,120
quite a number of authors and

520
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,880
contributors that spread across the

521
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,200
various sort of continents around the

522
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,919
world so there's two slots so hopefully

523
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
one of those will

524
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,880
suit a

525
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,120
time zone for you

526
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,919
we

527
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,080
would like to finish the document of

528
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,720
course um there's there's been some

529
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,440
feature creep granted since we started

530
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,000
the work that was to be expected

531
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,919
uh we tried to limit that

532
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,320
of course if we if we keep the document

533
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
alive long enough we've got clever

534
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,480
people who are always going to

535
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,000
raise additional requirements um or or

536
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
use cases

537
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,679
so we you know we've tried to at this

538
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,919
point just sort of draw a line under the

539
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,919
document itself and i think once we

540
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,120
finish um these two sort of

541
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
major areas of discussion

542
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
uh we'll be ready to kind of stabilize

543
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,000
the document maybe go through a um

544
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,080
sort of text reduction exercise make

545
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,200
sure that

546
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,880
we try to keep the document as succinct

547
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,400
as possible

548
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,000
then look for uh working group um

549
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,799
uh last call probably certainly sometime

550
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,200
before ietf114

551
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,799
okay i think that's the final slide i

552
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,960
had any questions

553
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,360
looks like we might have some people in

554
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,720
queue uh

555
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,440
or uh as was in the chat john asked that

556
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,200
we make sure to say our names before we

557
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,120
say anything of course i just violated

558
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,799
that this is

559
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,559
um so uh first thank you please go ahead

560
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,960
uh yeah hi this is dhruv uh

561
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,919
dan one query regarding why did we limit

562
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,760
it to srt only are we saying that srt is

563
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
an example or are we saying that the

564
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,480
scope of the whole document is only when

565
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,280
an ip layer we do srte this plot is not

566
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,520
very clear to me

567
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,640
no i

568
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,000
i i think that was just um essentially

569
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,360
the

570
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
requirement that we had from some of the

571
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,159
authors

572
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,840
um and

573
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,640
we could look to expand on that it just

574
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,960
hasn't been

575
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,440
a specific requirement from other people

576
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,640
we haven't seen it from the working

577
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,960
group so we just wanted to kind of limit

578
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,760
the scope of sort of the use case and

579
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,039
the scenarios that we were looking at

580
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,280
my suggestion would be that we

581
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,120
can easily do this by saying that we are

582
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,840
using srt as an example in the rest of

583
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,559
the document and since ac tn procedures

584
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,799
are anywhere agnostic to it

585
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,480
like you know they can be applied in a

586
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,720
similar fashion so i think using that

587
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
kind of terminology would be much better

588
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,200
than rather having a document that only

589
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,880
focuses on srt and uses the name actin

590
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,679
yeah i do i do take your point um it's

591
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,720
just that even by saying that srt as an

592
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,799
example there is still a lot of sort of

593
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,000
detail

594
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,840
minutiae that needs to be described um

595
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,159
you've so we're dealing with a lot of

596
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,000
potential options even by just saying

597
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
that srt

598
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,600
is the use case that we're using here

599
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,080
but i'll try to all the authors will try

600
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,200
to

601
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,919
um just highlight that this isn't the

602
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,159
only technology that's supported at the

603
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,159
higher layer but it's the example that

604
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,679
we've used

605
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,240
okay thank you

606
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,919
yeah i think that's a really good

607
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,120
comment

608
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,679
one that matches uh how

609
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,600
um the stat the level uh srte played in

610
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,080
the when we adopted the document

611
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,720
you know srte was listed literally once

612
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,320
it wasn't the focus of the document so

613
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,120
that's

614
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,200
that readjustment um

615
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
it would be really good so thank you

616
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,639
uh moving on in the cube

617
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,159
thanks this is daniel a question to to

618
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,960
droop is your concern related to the

619
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,120
fact that we are just

620
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,279
dealing with the tea technologies and we

621
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,000
should should cover also known te

622
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,039
or

623
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,000
uh

624
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,400
the the concern is more related to to

625
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,120
say

626
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,080
segment routing itself

627
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,799
no a concern is like even if rsvpt is

628
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,400
available that should be fine right we

629
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,760
should not limit

630
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,880
that

631
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,200
in ctn poi is only with srt

632
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,320
okay

633
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,159
yep so understood uh

634
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,440
on that drew danielle and lou yeah

635
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,520
and just adding a little color to that

636
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,080
comment um when the document was adopted

637
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,559
i believe srte was mentioned once as was

638
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,720
rsvp mentioned once uh now uh i think

639
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,640
srte i just did a quick search shows up

640
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,679
94 times and rsvp is still one

641
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,600
so um yeah

642
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
a detailed example is great but it's uh

643
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
i think i think the comment is spot on

644
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
uh group's comment

645
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,919
uh moving on in the cube

646
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,039
yeah the problem with we face with this

647
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,640
document is that there are many options

648
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,559
when you start looking at multi-domain

649
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,799
vpn there are many options to do them

650
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
and then you do multi-layer there are

651
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
many options to multi-layer and we were

652
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,120
a little bit afraid that we are going to

653
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,559
explode

654
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,360
on the the set of cases that we need to

655
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,600
analyze so we said no

656
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
all the other cases are not excluded

657
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,039
but we decided we we we said that it's

658
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,279
better to focus only on one case which

659
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,480
is srt

660
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,240
if people is interested to have other

661
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,880
cases we can they can be analyzed

662
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,039
either in a new document or otherwise we

663
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,440
can expand the scope of this document

664
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,799
but take into account that the more

665
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,120
options we put the bigger the document

666
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,760
becomes uh

667
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,240
ideal the ideal scenario is that you

668
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,919
discuss everything in a path controlled

669
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,640
technology agnostic manner and then

670
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,520
expand on examples where

671
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,360
they are specific to that particular

672
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,640
path control technology so take that

673
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
into account and see if you can uh

674
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,039
uh address the rules comment

675
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,559
the generic example and not on the

676
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,360
specific yeah okay

677
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,320
okay okay uh i think you're done dan

678
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,399
right

679
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,760
thanks guys

680
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,240
yeah thank you

681
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,340
[Music]

682
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,760
okay adrian you should have the

683
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,640
slides you were here briefly you seem to

684
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,720
have disappeared

685
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,720
um

686
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,159
all right you should have slide control

687
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,720
and voice

688
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,799
adrian

689
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,600
we are not hearing you

690
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,320
it says you're muted

691
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,880
adrian we can't hear you

692
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
maybe try entering the queue

693
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,200
see if that helps

694
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,279
you don't by any chance have the uh

695
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,880
lower right lower

696
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,760
local mute button

697
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,120
you can just try shouting really really

698
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,360
loud and hopefully i'll hear you

699
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
i'm going to try taking away your slide

700
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,279
privileges and then maybe we can restart

701
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,880
the whole process and then if we're not

702
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,120
we'll ask you to rejoin and then you

703
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,399
know move to the next one and ask you to

704
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,240
join so let's i'm going to revoke slides

705
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,520
from you

706
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,760
let's try to

707
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,080
try it again

708
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,360
adrian i think you should re-enter maybe

709
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,799
you know hit reload on your browser

710
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,279
uh we'll give him like uh half a minute

711
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,919
and if it doesn't work we will move on

712
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:58,880
to

713
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,279
well we'll skip him and come back to him

714
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,200
we were ahead of the schedule by a

715
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,279
couple of minutes i guess this is

716
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,880
helping

717
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,720
this is just trying to get us get rid of

718
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,799
it all right adrian we see you back but

719
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,080
we don't see you unmuted

720
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
yeah now i'm on

721
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,000
right

722
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,720
what happened was when you um i'd

723
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,080
requested uh share slides and you

724
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,799
granted share slides and my mic

725
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,360
disappeared

726
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,840
interesting um that's really bizarre

727
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,720
uh

728
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,200
i certainly write for asking i shouldn't

729
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,760
ever ask right hello you should have

730
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,840
slide control and we can hear you so

731
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,559
please proceed thank you right so uh

732
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,080
network slicing framework um

733
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,600
the thing to start

734
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,039
is this note well

735
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,559
um i

736
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,320
there used to be eight front page

737
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,720
authors uh all the way through this

738
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,919
document

739
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,039
uh and we ran into a bug in the itf

740
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,880
draft submission tool

741
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,080
where having precisely eight authors

742
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,399
caused the date field to get scribbled

743
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,440
on and sent the submission failed uh so

744
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,159
the solution there was to arbitrarily

745
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,519
remove uh eric from the

746
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,559
authors and move him to the contributors

747
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,159
please note this in no way reflects on

748
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,200
eric's very considerable input and

749
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,559
advice

750
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,720
that happened as this document was being

751
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,279
created

752
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,080
uh right recent vision uh revisions uh

753
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,120
since we held an interim uh

754
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,240
in teas in october and devoted quite a

755
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,480
lot of time to discussion

756
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,559
i will not go through all these bullets

757
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,919
but they've been three um revisions that

758
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,720
were basically picking up and clearing

759
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,840
out the points that were

760
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,080
raised and discussed at the interim

761
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,559
uh and getting so that

762
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,480
zero eight completed all of that

763
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,240
um

764
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,200
and included a fairly detailed editorial

765
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,360
read through by john drake and me

766
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,880
fixing a lot of knits and

767
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,320
duplication

768
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,159
that we found

769
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,720
some of the old text was still kicking

770
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,399
around from the very first revision and

771
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,279
that

772
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,320
needed tidying up

773
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,640
so uh there is a zero nine in the buffer

774
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,919
um for submission soon and i i plan that

775
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,760
this week

776
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,880
it includes a short section

777
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,919
on realization of slices

778
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,279
um

779
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,519
with respect to service function

780
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,799
chaining which is a a special case

781
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,600
uh and uh uses uh ancillary

782
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,320
uh service demarcation points

783
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,480
uh service delivery points rather uh

784
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,720
that text comes from med

785
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,080
and um we'll sit down uh with the other

786
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,519
realization

787
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,880
examples and it's brief

788
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,880
uh also going is section 5.4

789
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,840
um

790
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,440
the various prunings and tidings up made

791
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,760
this a really small section

792
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,720
and it only says what is already in

793
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,880
other places in the document so we'll

794
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,200
take that out

795
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
and i don't think we lose anything

796
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,720
uh thanks to john uh again for finding

797
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,679
even more knits uh

798
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,360
it seems to be no end to the number of

799
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,960
nits uh it's probably because i can't

800
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,880
type

801
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,320
and previously i'd forgot to acknowledge

802
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,600
kristoff so that goes in 0-9

803
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,240
if you um look uh in the

804
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,600
um

805
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,840
hedge dock i've

806
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,320
got some additional material that was

807
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,120
not

808
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,000
on the sides because it's happened to um

809
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,560
too recently

810
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,639
there's a further change there planned

811
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,320
for 09 which was discussed on the the

812
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,879
mailing list uh it's an extra sentence

813
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,040
going into 4.1.2 on sles

814
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,119
to mention the realization um or how the

815
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,599
operator realizes a

816
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,879
slice

817
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,040
may itself be an sle

818
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,520
and this is especially uh because of the

819
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,440
case of multicast

820
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,159
uh where apparently customers like to

821
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,480
tell the operator how to deliver the

822
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,239
multicast

823
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,440
um

824
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,520
of course the customer may have no way

825
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,560
to know whether this is actually done

826
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,359
there was some text sort of about this

827
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,440
in uh zero seven

828
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,839
uh and it got lost in the editorial tidy

829
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,839
up so uh that's going back in

830
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,240
okay that's zero nine

831
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,480
then um we've had some recent

832
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,440
discussions on the list uh which i think

833
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,119
are resolved

834
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,480
um one of them was how is hub and spoke

835
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,160
reflected in the service and the

836
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,640
realization

837
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,680
this

838
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,040
text

839
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,520
was in and then out and so it's now

840
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,880
going back in

841
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,040
um a provider may use hub and spoke to

842
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,520
realize a slice if they like

843
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,480
and a customer that wants to control the

844
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,839
hub

845
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,440
may build a hub and spoke themselves

846
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,240
out of p2p and p2mp connectivity

847
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,599
constructs

848
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,400
where the hub is actually a customer's

849
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,839
device

850
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,720
or they could use a real or ancillary

851
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,720
service demarcation point as the hub

852
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,160
okay there was another

853
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,480
discussion should this draft be limited

854
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,560
to the requirements and applicability

855
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,599
arising from 5g

856
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,359
i don't want to be accused of calling

857
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,599
consensus but it seems that the

858
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,079
overwhelming view on the list was that

859
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,720
the scope must include any use of

860
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,400
network slicing

861
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,599
but of course take advice from the 5g

862
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,599
use case because it's important

863
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,880
uh our related issue was should this

864
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,000
draft be limited to slicing only ipmpls

865
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,079
networks

866
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,960
again i don't want to call consensus

867
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,880
but what i think i heard

868
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,560
was that the service should be

869
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,880
technology agnostic and totally generic

870
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,200
and we are interested in mapping the

871
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,880
service to any ietf network

872
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,000
the realities and discussions of how to

873
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,040
slice

874
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,599
uh sub-ip networks

875
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,400
then belong in other places and their

876
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,720
realization questions

877
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,640
rather than um

878
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,839
framework or service questions

879
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,480
so related to those two points there may

880
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,640
be some specific questions the sea camp

881
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,560
chairs want to raise

882
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,440
uh

883
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,280
but these are the

884
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
these i think are the questions to tease

885
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,920
and not to the editor of the document

886
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,400
and i see danielle in the queue so

887
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,200
perhaps uh now it's good time to take it

888
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,880
thanks again

889
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,960
yeah actually i mean

890
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,640
uh two of the specific questions and

891
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,440
finally i don't hear danielle

892
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,359
oh

893
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,319
is it only you

894
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,359
before it worked it's only adrian it's

895
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,040
only adrian you sound good okay

896
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,119
so continue

897
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,640
how can we

898
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,079
telegen what we're seeing

899
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,359
adrian can you hear us

900
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,920
well this this really sucks um i see

901
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,119
that

902
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,119
um

903
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,359
yes lou has just typed at me my audio is

904
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,400
broken and funnily enough yes it is

905
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,920
because um i can see who's talking but

906
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,720
not here

907
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,800
um

908
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,440
i don't know if it's worth continuing

909
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,760
um

910
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,480
uh i i can take the comment and then the

911
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,320
typo you type it on the chat for adrian

912
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,079
after

913
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,119
uh so the thing is that uh uh we

914
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,880
identified some some questions uh uh

915
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,079
from c camper to teaser uh probably the

916
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,680
two most relevants are the ones that

917
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,400
they didn't just described on uh 5g and

918
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,880
limiting uh slicing it to apm pls

919
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,079
networks

920
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,200
these these are questions that popped up

921
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,359
while discussing uh

922
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,640
slicing at

923
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,760
other questions were brought to the

924
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,000
mailing list by igor so i don't know if

925
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,160
you want we can do a summary of those

926
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,160
questions but i would say that

927
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,280
they have already been discussed uh

928
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,520
pretty pretty extensively so

929
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,200
up to you if you prefer us to send a a

930
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,079
new email summarizing the questions we

931
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,200
will do that

932
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,760
otherwise i think we are satisfied with

933
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,839
the the answers that we received so far

934
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,520
yeah i'd say if you're satisfied with

935
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,480
the answers there's not much to discuss

936
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,200
so

937
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,359
we don't have to discuss it again

938
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,400
okay um

939
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,960
in terms of the it sounds like there's

940
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,920
answers you're not happy with

941
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,880
by the way i'm getting great after that

942
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,560
uh if there's answers you're not the

943
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,760
question

944
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,359
you're not happy with the answers with

945
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,440
which ones are those are the ones on the

946
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,560
slides here

947
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,880
for something else

948
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,760
the most relevant ones are these two and

949
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,160
we are we are happy with those

950
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,800
with the answer

951
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,400
you are or not i'm sorry

952
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,280
and i'll point out even though he

953
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,560
doesn't hear us so it's good that he

954
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,319
doesn't hear that he has this power it

955
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,680
is the job of the editor to capture what

956
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,200
they believe is the consensus of the

957
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,079
working group in that document so he's

958
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,319
done uh just fine here from our our

959
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,359
standpoint and um we appreciate that i'm

960
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,599
gonna tell him that he should uh

961
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,040
continue going

962
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,720
and uh

963
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,480
and then at the end we'll figure out how

964
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,839
to deal with his audio

965
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,000
right

966
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,079
most peculiar way of communicating i

967
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,839
hope that that um that was an

968
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,359
interesting conversation that you had

969
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,960
and i will listen to the recording

970
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,880
afterwards to find out what it was about

971
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,800
um

972
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,760
all right there was a question

973
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,079
uh about whether we should include

974
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,079
worked examples this question has been

975
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,599
around for a while

976
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,200
but nobody actually coughed up any text

977
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,720
and

978
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,640
apart from med who pointed me at some

979
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,440
text from

980
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,000
8969 that could be useful

981
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,359
two questions really arise here one is

982
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,200
does anyone think that the draft will

983
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,319
fail without examples

984
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,880
and the other is is anyone volunteering

985
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,960
to write text for examples

986
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,119
luis go ahead

987
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,599
yeah this is from telefonica i would

988
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,359
like just to comment that the

989
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,119
can you speak can you get a little

990
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,119
closer to the mic please sorry

991
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,480
yeah i would like just to comment that

992
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,240
there are some other documents starting

993
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,960
to

994
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,319
to describe some potential examples uh

995
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,800
in my case i will present later on one

996
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,440
of how to map in three bps places to be

997
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,839
it's called idf is less sorry so

998
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,079
probably that word could be or either

999
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,240
integrated or keep it apart but there

1000
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,960
will be some documents discovering that

1001
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,280
i think

1002
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,960
i have to say that was so low i couldn't

1003
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,040
really catch it i'm hoping

1004
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,720
um

1005
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,040
did you catch it

1006
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,520
yeah he said that he there are other

1007
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,040
documents where examples are being

1008
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,960
specified one of those documents is

1009
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,680
being presented later on today uh so i

1010
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,920
guess his preference is not to i mean i

1011
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,079
guess he's leaving it to the working

1012
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,520
group to decide if it needs to be

1013
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,440
discussed separately or

1014
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,440
somehow roll it into an app index into

1015
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,960
this document

1016
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,800
but yeah the point is making is it's

1017
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,040
been discussed in some other documents

1018
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,240
examples are being discussed in the

1019
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,479
world

1020
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,319
okay

1021
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,359
oh sorry can you hear me now

1022
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,720
yes

1023
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,920
yeah

1024
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,400
so i was i wanted to volunteer to write

1025
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,319
the example but if it is covered

1026
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,400
elsewhere that's fine

1027
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,480
and i also wanted to make a comment that

1028
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,839
there are too many things in the

1029
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,520
framework documents so maybe one example

1030
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
won't be sufficient

1031
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,119
we may need to have two or three

1032
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,839
different instances of how to show this

1033
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,400
framework in works

1034
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,720
thanks

1035
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,079
the first question is whether or not

1036
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,160
it's helpful to have examples answered

1037
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
in my opinion is yes

1038
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
and i can volunteer to write down

1039
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,920
something about 5g because there are

1040
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,720
lots of discussion about 5g and i

1041
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,359
felt that it is good to have a good

1042
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,680
example of 5g at least to have the same

1043
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,440
context for everyone because people

1044
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,599
talking about that but the context might

1045
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,920
be different so i volunteered to do that

1046
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,520
one and i talked to adrian about it

1047
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,920
thank you reza appreciate you willing

1048
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,560
your willingness to help

1049
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,640
i think we don't have anyone else in

1050
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,560
excuse yeah okay

1051
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,800
um

1052
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,000
yes so please please

1053
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,160
uh yeah so so please um reza and uh

1054
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,800
kieran and lewis um drop me a mail and

1055
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,240
we can talk about what type of example

1056
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,560
we're looking at and whether the

1057
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,839
how to map 5g um

1058
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,040
is uh is a good or a bad uh solution

1059
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,440
uh right at this point i just want to

1060
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,920
draw your attention to um the uh five

1061
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,760
extra threads that have come up in the

1062
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,040
last couple of days on the mailing list

1063
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,880
i've put those uh summary of those into

1064
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,960
hedgedock as well

1065
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,520
um

1066
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,200
the first of them

1067
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,720
is um

1068
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,280
just to re-highlight that a service is

1069
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,079
not a realization of the service and

1070
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,319
this is my usual rant

1071
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,920
uh about um the fact that l3 vpn has

1072
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,079
confused the service delivered to the

1073
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,000
customer with the technology used to

1074
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,560
realize the service um

1075
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,960
and since his point keeps coming up we

1076
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,800
should perhaps include a brief piece of

1077
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,440
text on the subject in the draft

1078
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,119
right just to help make it clear

1079
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,839
there was a point about sdp and sap

1080
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,839
where sap is a

1081
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,480
generic concept

1082
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,000
in the ops area working group

1083
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,200
and there's also a mention of an sep

1084
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,880
in other documents

1085
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,640
i don't believe that there's a need for

1086
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,960
us to make any change in what we've got

1087
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,880
but i'd be happy to hear otherwise

1088
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,040
there's a really active thread on

1089
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,240
receiver slos uh and i don't believe

1090
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,079
that we've reached a point where we can

1091
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:52,960
um

1092
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,920
draw a conclusion from that so please

1093
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,880
contribute to that discussion

1094
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,000
um and that may lead on to the idea of a

1095
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,960
group slo whether it's an slo that

1096
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,200
applies um

1097
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,160
to these to a set of

1098
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,440
connectivity constructs

1099
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,400
and then most recently there's a start

1100
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,280
of a thread on multiplexing and i need

1101
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,520
to push on that a bit more because i'm

1102
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,640
not quite sure which bit of multiplexing

1103
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,000
um what and where in the network

1104
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,040
that applies so uh watch out for emails

1105
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,160
on all of these

1106
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,559
which takes me then to my last slide

1107
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,720
which says um

1108
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,359
i will be posting 0.9

1109
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,720
um

1110
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,200
we're probably not quite done yet

1111
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,119
because there are those five issues to

1112
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,720
be pushed through

1113
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,359
but at that point i think we might be

1114
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:52,400
ready for

1115
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,920
last call

1116
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,280
and i will now stop talking

1117
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,599
okay uh thank you adrian uh

1118
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:04,839
please go

1119
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:08,240
ahead yeah swim hendrix from nokia i

1120
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,319
raised the point on this multiplexing

1121
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,079
and mapping i see

1122
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,200
we had a bit of a threat it's related to

1123
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,359
the realization to a certain extent but

1124
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,119
not the real realization so it's

1125
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,720
actually

1126
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,319
in the middle so you have i think the

1127
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,839
document right now the framework

1128
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,480
describes let's say the upper level of

1129
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,800
what the slicing is for itf

1130
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,280
i believe and i'm not sure whether i

1131
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,880
probably it's not this document but that

1132
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,400
is in my view a need to describe

1133
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,559
the realization aspect in an abstract

1134
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,960
way without going into the technology as

1135
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,920
such because there is a layer in between

1136
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,319
that is important that i does what i

1137
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,400
call multiplexing and mapping maybe

1138
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,760
there is a better technology but i

1139
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,040
believe that's important now the

1140
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,040
question is

1141
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,079
how would that be in a separate document

1142
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,480
that is detached from it but associated

1143
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,119
with it before we go into the specific

1144
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,520
technology implementations that's why i

1145
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,160
raised this point

1146
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,079
yeah to just answer your question we

1147
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,400
might reply to your email so i think

1148
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,200
that idea in my opinion is valid but we

1149
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,800
can discuss that one since you are here

1150
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,400
we can discuss that if you want

1151
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,640
okay so we can go to the next uh

1152
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,319
draft hello everyone uh

1153
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,359
my name is

1154
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,640
cui i'm from siena on behalf of my

1155
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,480
co-authors bo drew and trek and

1156
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,119
tarek and uh luian

1157
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,319
i'm going to present you the young model

1158
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,040
for the ita network slice services

1159
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,119
next slide please

1160
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,800
just remind the

1161
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,359
just a reminder what we try to do here

1162
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,240
is

1163
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,720
if we consider the

1164
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,880
itf network slice service

1165
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,240
controller

1166
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,000
there is a northbound which is a

1167
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,319
technology agnostic it receives a

1168
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,800
request to create

1169
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,119
an itf network a slice service with a

1170
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,119
specific characteristic as adrian

1171
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,160
mentioned in the previous draft

1172
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,000
and we have a southbound which is a

1173
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,480
technology specific we want to implement

1174
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,760
it on an ip or mpls or optics or other

1175
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,160
technology this document is going to

1176
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,359
talk about

1177
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,640
the former the northbound interface that

1178
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,760
we have

1179
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,040
and

1180
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,640
we had the

1181
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,599
really the one you will see here that

1182
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,960
what are the

1183
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,319
main changes that happen i

1184
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,040
assume you already read the first draft

1185
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,440
or the this draft you already know what

1186
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,359
the context here is what is the

1187
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,040
structure of the

1188
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,119
draft trying to say

1189
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,680
one thing that we did is

1190
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,640
we aligned the network slice connection

1191
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,119
with the definition of the

1192
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,200
connectivity construct that we had the

1193
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,920
whole idea of these changes are we want

1194
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,559
to make sure that we adhere

1195
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,640
and follow the framework suggestion

1196
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,960
whatever framework is discussing in

1197
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,680
terms of the structure in terms of the

1198
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,319
terminology we are going to reflect it

1199
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,559
here and these changes that you you see

1200
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,520
here is basically the reflection of that

1201
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,800
fact

1202
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,760
we also introduced the context of the

1203
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,839
network connection network slice

1204
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,800
connection groups the whole idea of the

1205
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,480
grouping

1206
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,280
some connection which have the same

1207
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,839
characteristic in terms of the slo and

1208
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,240
sle this is introduced

1209
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,119
and

1210
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,240
the

1211
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,359
as you see here the network slice type

1212
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:50,160
and ep roll these are removed but the

1213
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,480
one thing that we didn't do that one in

1214
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,240
this draft is changing the network uh

1215
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,680
slice endpoint to stp that right now

1216
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,839
that term is used we are going to do

1217
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,240
that one in the next list as you see

1218
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,160
here all my references i call it nsa

1219
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,880
your network slice endpoint but just

1220
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,880
make sure that you understand this is an

1221
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,200
sdp the framework suggested and we are

1222
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,880
going to change it

1223
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,359
the next bullet is as network as slice

1224
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,559
tag nstack we introduced that one and

1225
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,119
this is in our uh

1226
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,440
our opinion is a good

1227
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,000
uh tool to address lots of the

1228
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,680
discussion that we had in the mailing

1229
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,839
list for example there was some question

1230
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,000
that how we can introduce

1231
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,720
some aspect of the for example customer

1232
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,760
name for some application like 5g how i

1233
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,319
can specify the network slice id which

1234
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:45,680
is coming down

1235
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,240
if there is a big if here that if we

1236
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,280
want to somehow the higher layer knows

1237
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,240
about

1238
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,160
some type of the realization that we

1239
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,000
want to do in the network it knows that

1240
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,720
we want to use layer 2 or layer 3. we

1241
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,440
can use this stack to just reflect that

1242
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,240
fact this stack is optional if you don't

1243
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
want to use it don't use it and this is

1244
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,160
a network slash controller's job to

1245
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,800
address all those but this is a very

1246
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,599
good extensible approach that in the

1247
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,079
future if you want to add anything else

1248
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,480
we can just do that one and we design

1249
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,119
the yang model which is extensible and

1250
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,280
there is no need for augmentation of any

1251
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,480
sort

1252
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,760
and last but not least we add some

1253
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,880
action about the accessport access

1254
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,440
connection between c and pe and you can

1255
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,160
go through the detail of that something

1256
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,079
was added here and

1257
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,400
these are basically the reflection the

1258
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,559
overall reflection of the changes that

1259
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,040
has been done in release one

1260
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,680
next please

1261
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:48,960
as

1262
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,240
the scene here the idea of the network

1263
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,440
construct modeling there are three

1264
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,000
type of the connection is described in

1265
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,240
the framework point to point point to

1266
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,280
multipoint and any to any but and this

1267
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,520
is basically the reflection of those

1268
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,520
things as you see here the network

1269
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,160
connection that we are referring here is

1270
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,119
depicted here as mentioned before nse is

1271
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,680
basically the sdp the access port

1272
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,520
that the the

1273
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,520
connectivity between the any two

1274
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,000
nses and there are one direction as you

1275
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,839
see some of them then for example point

1276
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,520
to point if i want to have that

1277
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,920
bi-directional connectivity i have to

1278
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,720
define both and why we did it this way

1279
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,800
because in some example

1280
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,359
for example the the

1281
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,319
donor stream and upstream uh traffic

1282
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,200
they have the different sla and slo from

1283
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,440
that earthquake it's a very right

1284
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,720
approach to

1285
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,799
make the that one and if you want to

1286
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,960
have both of them same as slow and

1287
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,520
slowly it should be also possible to do

1288
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,000
next please

1289
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,880
this is another example of uh for

1290
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,040
whatever adrian mentioned before that if

1291
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,839
we want to have some example to a

1292
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,799
concrete example to show what we want to

1293
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,079
do the overall picture shows that i have

1294
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,000
a network of slice 1 and s1

1295
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,839
which contains three group of

1296
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,920
connections connection blue red

1297
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,040
green and think of color as the slo and

1298
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,920
sle that that connection wants whatever

1299
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,880
it is

1300
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,720
so the whole idea here is

1301
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,440
each connection that we have here it has

1302
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,040
a type and it has an slo that basically

1303
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,599
carries and from that aspect you can

1304
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,520
extend this one to any number of the

1305
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,440
connection that you want to do whether

1306
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,000
or not it is applicable to any specific

1307
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,240
use case it depends on the use case for

1308
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,760
some of the use case it doesn't make

1309
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,760
sense we have to have only one of them

1310
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,480
but from the modeling perspective we

1311
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,400
should allow that and this is exactly

1312
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,200
what

1313
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,400
has been done

1314
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,559
next please

1315
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,680
there are few issues that it still is in

1316
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,240
progress i will go through that

1317
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,440
one slight pair issue that we have one

1318
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,160
was the network slice group as i

1319
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,599
mentioned the whole idea of the grouping

1320
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,000
the network is licensed you know

1321
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,599
we want to see

1322
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,319
some other the type of harvard spoke

1323
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,319
adrian talked about that as well you

1324
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,040
want to see if it should be added there

1325
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,480
and also adding connectivity type at the

1326
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,400
network layer as a connection layer for

1327
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,960
example in the previous example if the

1328
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,000
green is point to point

1329
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,720
there is no need to specify the type for

1330
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,040
each connection you can specify green is

1331
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,799
point to point and everybody will

1332
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,640
inherit that those type of things we

1333
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,280
want to add and this was some suggestion

1334
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,319
from the mailing list that we thought it

1335
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,160
uh it is valid and it's going to be

1336
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,720
added to the next uh release next please

1337
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,240
the second one is a

1338
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,480
four-wall uh import of rfc 9181 which is

1339
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,000
uh

1340
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,839
the discussion about the

1341
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,599
common young model

1342
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:12,400
the

1343
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,640
we want to use that one and the proposal

1344
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,760
here is that if you want to regroup that

1345
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,559
and having basically the same structure

1346
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,520
of that yang in our model right now our

1347
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,040
model is

1348
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,680
the one layer and that whether or not it

1349
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,400
is

1350
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,599
good to separate it and have same

1351
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,359
consistency that rfc 9181 has so he is

1352
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,520
still doing a discussion and this is

1353
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,000
another topic that i think is important

1354
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,680
to be addressed

1355
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,280
going to the next issue

1356
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,440
[Music]

1357
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,760
adding a statistical parameter for

1358
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,079
example for the slo

1359
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,400
as you see here the

1360
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,880
the current slot that we have

1361
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,160
is clearly you see here and the whole

1362
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,240
idea here is as the framework uh

1363
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,640
goes to the next

1364
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,640
the version and if there is anything

1365
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,640
will be added the proposal has that we

1366
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,480
are going to add it into the framework

1367
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,200
and in most cases the yang model is

1368
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,280
defined in such a way that is extensible

1369
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,559
there is no need really to do the

1370
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,599
augmentation we have it there and

1371
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,200
there are

1372
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,079
a very nice way to you know extend the

1373
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,160
model but this is a valid point and as

1374
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,119
the framework goes and add more and we

1375
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,799
are going to add that one to the next

1376
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,559
release of the

1377
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,000
yang model

1378
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,760
and i think that one

1379
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,160
if you go to the next one concludes the

1380
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,319
discussion that we have here

1381
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,920
if i summarize

1382
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,480
for us the nexus service at least

1383
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,920
address these three issues that i

1384
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,520
mentioned to you

1385
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,760
and uh including the i didn't mention

1386
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,559
that sdp to nse now one of those but

1387
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,520
that one should be also part of that

1388
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,160
and there are two uh that the last two

1389
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,799
it was uh mentioned by tariq a few days

1390
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,480
ago that we want to align the

1391
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,119
terminology for the access port with

1392
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,920
the document that we already have and

1393
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,240
clarify the concept of the access point

1394
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,880
node id because there was something that

1395
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,040
we use at two eyes and for the

1396
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,119
multi-homing how it's going to be others

1397
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,119
so longer story show

1398
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,440
three issues plus a couple of them that

1399
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,760
i mentioned here you know at most four

1400
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,480
or five issues will be addressed and we

1401
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,599
feel that at that point we reach to

1402
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,559
a level that we address all the the

1403
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,480
question on the mega list

1404
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,480
so i think we are doing well for the

1405
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,720
timing if there's any question i'd say

1406
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,440
the

1407
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,920
critique

1408
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,240
please hit

1409
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,720
okay

1410
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,480
hello

1411
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,480
hi this is kiriti

1412
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,559
um so

1413
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,480
there are several points you made

1414
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,520
one is

1415
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:04,160
you call it the vpn type for the access

1416
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,440
and i like that it's there but i i would

1417
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,760
prefer that you said something like

1418
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,040
the layer

1419
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,880
of the access layer one layer two layer

1420
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,839
three as opposed to vpn type

1421
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,400
because um if there's a layer two for

1422
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,680
example you might just say it's a vlan

1423
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,000
or it might be a vpls or it might be

1424
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,119
evpn

1425
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,680
so i don't want to get to the specifics

1426
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,280
of the especially in the northbound

1427
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,240
model

1428
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,880
just say i'm connecting at layer 2 i'm

1429
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,040
connecting in layer 3 or maybe i'm

1430
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,280
connecting at layer 1. that's just a

1431
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,440
suggestion in the southbound you might

1432
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,680
say oh i would like to make this vpls

1433
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,839
but in the northbound from a

1434
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,000
higher level point of view just i want a

1435
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,079
layer 2 connection yeah that one makes

1436
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,480
sense it's exactly i guess adrian also

1437
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,559
mentioned previously that it's better to

1438
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:57,839
make it a technology agnostic as much as

1439
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,520
we can and this is a good suggestion

1440
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,880
okay thank you and then um for your

1441
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,480
issue number two

1442
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,290
can you go back to

1443
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:08,409
[Music]

1444
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,920
using that common yang model i like the

1445
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,960
idea

1446
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,520
but i think it was written so that it's

1447
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,839
common between the two vp and l2 vpn and

1448
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,799
lcvpn you may

1449
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,799
you know if it works great

1450
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,400
if it doesn't work you might want to

1451
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,599
extend it

1452
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,920
and say this is a common model

1453
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,720
to you know to be across different types

1454
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,000
of things

1455
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,640
but from what i remember this is

1456
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,440
primarily to make sure that the l2 and

1457
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,319
l3 vpn the network models

1458
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,720
have these in common so if you can reuse

1459
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,359
it great but you might have to extend it

1460
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,359
sure that is a valid point and there was

1461
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,640
another that along the same discussion

1462
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,040
the drew also mentioned that if we can

1463
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,119
if we can for example not able to use

1464
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,599
that we can in our model separate we

1465
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,559
have the same concept of putting

1466
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,359
two young models maybe in one file but

1467
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,240
the two one is common one is a specific

1468
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,559
and in the future people can use that

1469
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,960
common model that we have that is also

1470
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,039
another way that we want to see if it is

1471
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,680
possible but your point is uh is valid

1472
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,559
is taken and we consider that great and

1473
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,119
then you have that diagram with three

1474
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,680
types of connections all in the same

1475
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,480
uh

1476
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,680
slice maybe red green and blue or red

1477
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,119
this this one

1478
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,760
so i was wondering when i saw this if

1479
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,839
there are common things

1480
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:35,680
can you sort of abstract the common

1481
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,680
things for example they all have the

1482
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,880
same

1483
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,799
bandwidth and not bandwidth they have

1484
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:41,920
the same

1485
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,520
latency requirements but they have

1486
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,440
different bandwidth requirements

1487
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,760
or things like that and then i saw your

1488
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,680
connection group

1489
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,520
and so maybe

1490
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,839
can those two work together basically in

1491
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:55,599
this example we have three connection

1492
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,000
groups blue red green so this is a

1493
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,680
connection group i think if you want to

1494
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,960
go that in my opinion it might be

1495
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,359
possible but we make the model very

1496
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,760
complex we want to make sure that when

1497
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,400
we say blue blue is blue whether or not

1498
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,400
if they are the same way you have three

1499
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,039
of them just put everything into one so

1500
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,440
the whole idea is from implementation

1501
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,400
perspective we don't want to be they try

1502
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,119
to go through all detail of a specific

1503
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,440
slo one vibram and so these are the same

1504
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,880
let's put it somewhere

1505
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,599
if as a operator you decide to make

1506
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,440
connection three of them you do it and

1507
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,680
they are sort of independent from the

1508
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,520
modeling perspective and i think it's

1509
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,920
very simple and at the same time very

1510
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,720
clean design instead of rather to put

1511
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,839
very complex logic to put some a

1512
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,839
specific you know together so from that

1513
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,160
last week i think it's better to keep it

1514
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,720
this way okay okay uh

1515
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,240
it was just a question

1516
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,039
the last point is in all of the slos

1517
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,839
i've seen it's been you know latency

1518
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,079
delay variations on

1519
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:02,480
is it not interesting to say

1520
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,039
my connection is protected

1521
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,240
is i mean because if a customer comes

1522
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,400
forget slicing they come to you and say

1523
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,960
i want a vpn from you and i want you to

1524
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,079
resolve the vpn over lsps that have

1525
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,720
protection so then you don't put it over

1526
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,680
a regular lsp make sure it's rsvp with

1527
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,680
protection

1528
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,680
is that not an interesting

1529
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,960
slo requirement from a network slicing

1530
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,039
point of view it might be but this is

1531
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,359
mainly the question for adrian for

1532
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,520
framework not this one we are just

1533
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,079
importing whatever is defined whether or

1534
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,680
not this is the case

1535
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,280
might be not slo but sla service level

1536
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,240
expectation is exactly those thing that

1537
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,799
you cannot necessarily measure them it's

1538
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:51,760
like security isolation those type of

1539
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,520
things this might be another one they

1540
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,960
say i need some sort of protection and

1541
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,799
again depends under what we want to put

1542
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,599
the frame or it it's a valid point yes

1543
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,680
it is valid but it's not relevant to

1544
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,520
this document if they are defining

1545
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,280
something we will import it and we add

1546
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,480
it to the

1547
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,920
to the model okay all right

1548
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,680
like 50 milliseconds yeah okay yeah so

1549
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,000
we have one more uh question in the

1550
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,680
queue where over time we should take

1551
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,000
that question and then uh

1552
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,240
stop and take our break

1553
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,280
because we're going to get cut off at

1554
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,799
some point

1555
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,359
greg go ahead

1556
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,319
um i'm much appreciated that you read

1557
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,319
the uh

1558
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:39,440
pointing to their protection

1559
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,480
i have

1560
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,680
somewhat different view i think this is

1561
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,919
how

1562
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,000
something can be

1563
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,440
realized

1564
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,559
and

1565
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,720
let's discuss it on a mailing list in a

1566
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,200
separate thread

1567
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,480
details but i think that

1568
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,440
their protection is

1569
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,480
something that operator can uh use

1570
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,400
whether redundancy or control plane uh

1571
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,319
service restoration

1572
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,680
and uh

1573
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,559
not necessarily needs to be exposed uh

1574
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,280
to their uh client thank you

1575
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,280
okay no problem yeah we can discuss it

1576
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,640
on the mailing list okay thanks everyone

1577
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,480
thank you all we will see you in less

1578
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,079
than half an hour

1579
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,480
um

1580
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,920
looking forward to continuing the good

1581
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,920
discussion

1582
