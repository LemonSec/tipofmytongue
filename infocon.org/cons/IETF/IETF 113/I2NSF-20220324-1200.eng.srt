16
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,680

um

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,720
of the meeting

any questions for the agenda

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
no question let's just go further

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
so um

47
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,519
for we haven't met for quite a few ietfs

48
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
because of a data model has been under

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,959
review there's lots of like minor

50
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,840
changes so couldn't warrant a

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
face-to-face meeting time

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
so now

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,760
we have three drafts under iesg review

54
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,720
right capability data model an sf

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,840
phasing interface and asset monitoring

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
data models

57
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,879
lately there are still

58
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,159
many uh

59
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,720
dialogue on them i think the

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
rome can you correct me if i'm

61
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
correct that

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,480
capability data model

63
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,159
um we still miss uh need one more yes

64
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,359
for this to move forward

65
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,360
that that that seems exactly right with

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
my recollection let me just confirm that

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
with the switch over the numbers may be

68
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,680
off by one or two so give me a second

69
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
yeah it'll be either if we're short it's

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,640
either kind of a yes or no objection uh

71
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,480
data tracker waiting to respond

72
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,640
yeah

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,280
yes hold on all right so yes so for the

74
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
capability model we're actually in

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,120
better shape than that we have enough

76
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
ballots we just need to

77
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,200
we just need to clear the discusses

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,319
is it okay if i talk about the other

79
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,958
documents too

80
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
yes

81
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,720
yeah okay so the capability document we

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,239
need to convert the

83
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,480
we have there's enough ballots uh the

84
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,360
discusses need to be clear for the

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,000
nsf facing interfaces

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,238
same situation enough ballots discusses

87
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,440
need to clear for the monitoring data

88
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,080
model though that has both discusses but

89
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
also needs more balance

90
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,880
oh that needs more balance okay so i see

91
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,360
lots of discussions um on the mailing

92
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
list

93
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,160
paul can you update us with that status

94
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,440
have you cleared

95
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,880
cleared all the discuss comments

96
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
so okay

97
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
um actually uh three um data young model

98
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,600
capability and spacing and

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,880
monitoring interface uh actually the

100
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
discussion uh discuss okay bullet will

101
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
be uh lifted because i addressed the

102
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
oral

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,960
discuss comment so also i send an email

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,639

105
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,600
so

106
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
leave those

107
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,919
maybe one or two uh discuss but i

108
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,440
believe i uh

109

about clearing discusses the other thing

128
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,080
i would say is about being off by one in

129
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,759
certain cases is

130
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,160
uh i believe that

131
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,000
ben's discusses are going to be picked

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
up uh by

133
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319

141

schedule he's to kind of pick up and

142
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,520
he's going to be able to adjudicate and

143
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,359
respond back to those things

144
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,560

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,680
we have two working group drafts waiting

150
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,759
to be sent to like for um last call

151
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,560
one is a consumer-facing interface data

152
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
model another one is registration

153
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,919
interface data model those two are to be

154
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,680
discussed today because there were

155
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,479
comments about those two

156
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,800
and also nsf facing

157
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,960
interface data model are not consistent

158
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
so paul is going to give us

159
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,080
an update on the changes and whether we

160
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,840
should make them consistent or not

161
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,440
with that

162
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,240
oh i just need to end my

175
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,919
yes yes you need all y'all

176
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
yeah

177
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,800
oh i mean the whole

178
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,280
screen

179
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,000
i'm sorry

180
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,840
okay

181
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,318
whoa

182
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,960
so kai okay here my my screen

183
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,199
yes yes

184
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,440
yes

185
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,360
hello hello everyone this is a draft of

186
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
it

187
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
remote attestation interface young data

188
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,599
model

189
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,919
and

190
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
in fact this is the second edition of

191
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,640
the original draft which name is the

192
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
trust enhanced isf

193
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,640
so

194
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,760
this uh compared to the first edition

195
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,200
we revised the drafts traffic name to i2

196
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
answer remote attestation interface

197
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,920
young data model and the the first

198
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,680
reason is that

199
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,320
it's more easy to align with the uh

200
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,680
right with the recharger of items or the

201
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,240
potential each other of i2 and sf

202
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
which we will discuss later and the

203
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
second reason is that the term of trust

204
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,200
enhanced is not a specific term which

205
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
may bring some potential controversial

206
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
misunderstanding

207
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,120
so the second item is that

208
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,279
we added a new paragraph about the

209
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,600
definition of granularity of remote

210
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
station in iphone 7.

211
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
and uh right now in my opinion i think

212
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,320
there are three components in

213
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
united

214
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,080
self-deserving remote stations and

215
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,200
there are nsfs and maybe the basic

216
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,680
platform to carry the asf and then

217
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
without trust which can be show the

218
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
device identity

219
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,480
the third volumeter is that the remote

220
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,959
adaptation interface is also reversed

221
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,440
based on the granularity of granularity

222
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,080
design and the two kinds of functions we

223
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,959
may remain in the interface

224
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,640
the remote procedure call and

225
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,160
notification

226
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
the last one is that

227
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,200
the reference value of remote station uh

228
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,000
can you hear me now

229
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,120
we can't hear you we can hear you

230
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
clearly

231
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,200
okay because i changed the screen

232
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,079
so i can hear i can't see the mid tackle

233
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,000
i can only see my pdf if there are

234
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
someone want to comment please let me

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,160
know

236
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,800
yes we'll let you know okay

237
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,600
okay

238
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,680
the last item is the reference value of

239
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,480
remote station and

240
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
this hasn't been defined by rights group

241
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
yet there have

242
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,680
some personal draft but hasn't been

243
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,839
adopted as working group

244
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,959
dropped so i just wrote a temporary

245
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,519
interface and add it to the draft next

246
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,160
slide is yeah this is a main topic it's

247
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,279
a

248
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
relationship between rights and i2s

249
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,800
remote addition

250
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,600
so

251
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
i think that the rights has defined the

252
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,640
basic architecture of remote station and

253
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,399
they find different types of remote

254
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,160
station evidence

255
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,680
like based on tpm and te and

256
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,519
maybe uccs

257
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,240
and other graphs like testing results

258
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,120
and

259
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,760
in the itunes remote edition i think

260
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,360
that we just focus on the remote station

261
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,480
of nsf uh especially in the iphone 7

262
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,440
architecture and the remote station

263
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
target is nsf and its platform and the

264
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,440
root of trust in irsf is unlimited so

265
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,640
it's a it may be a tpm maybe a te or

266
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,480
even uh like a quan uh qpc i'm not sure

267
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,640
and the verifier and the relevant party

268
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,360
in itunes i2sf

269
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
a

270
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,839
maybe a security controller which is to

271
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,880
be determined because

272
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,839
because we will discuss in the next page

273
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,560
so

274
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,600
with all these drafts right we need to

275
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
define one

276
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
interface in itunes self remotely

277
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,320
station and to focus on the answer

278
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
itself

279
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,160
next slide is about the necessity of

280
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,040
itunes for remote station i think there

281
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,760
are

282
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,320
three main reasons and the first one is

283
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
the security reasons and

284
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,120
in a remote environment the deployment

285
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,760
of sf may be inappropriate

286
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,560
and

287
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
then there may have potential attack but

288
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,120
the remote has remote platform that who

289
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,639
carries an isf and the third one is that

290
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,440
we may want to know the security status

291
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,560
of trustworthiness of the nsf

292
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,279
so the second mentor a main

293
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,519
reason is that the practicability

294
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,000
reasons and because that

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,720
the target and the granularity

296
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,360
in this remote session it should be the

297
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
asf

298
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,519
and the rest architecture is not very

299
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,480
convenient to use in

300
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,120
iphone directly because that a different

301
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,279
device may have different route of trust

302
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,320
and one unified remote station interface

303
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,279
would be more convenient for to nsf to

304
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,320
implementation and there are some

305
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,959
future extension reasons and this topic

306
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,800
may not include in ietf but i think

307
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,440
there are worse awards to mention about

308
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
and first maybe it's a zero trust

309
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,079
concept may use advanced remote

310
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,279
heitation to assess and sf trust status

311
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,160
and

312
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,600
maybe uh the sassy sase they may want to

313
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,639
use the itunes remote station to enhance

314
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,360
edge security function and then the

315
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,320
security automation i may use iphone sf

316
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,440
remote station to manage the asf

317
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,800
and the last

318
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,959
bullet is that a decentralized security

319
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,440
intelligence sharing may use remote

320
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,839
attestation to judge the trustworthiness

321
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
of such intelligence for example if a

322
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,959
device is untrusted so

323
00:13:58,959 --> 00:13:59,920
its

324
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,839
security intelligence may not useful

325
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
next slide is about the current

326
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,320
interface overview of the

327
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
of this draft

328
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
right now this draft only focus on the

329
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
sf remote station interface and the

330
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,199
reference value interface this two

331
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,519
interface is the basic interface of this

332
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,639
architecture and the um

333
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,519
the endoscope uh the connection between

334
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,600
the security controller and the industry

335
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,160
may not have to be an interface because

336
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,360
it may be

337
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,270
offline method like x5.9

338
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,959
[Music]

339
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,079
next slide is about the interface detail

340
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,880
and right now these drafts have three

341
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,360
basic groupings the first one is the

342
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,160
grouping uh sf remote attestation the

343
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,399
second is a grouping platform remote

344
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,160
attestation and the third third one is

345
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,639
root of trust remote attention

346
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,279
these three grouping will map to six

347
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,240
different

348
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,360
interfaces like a notification of nsf

349
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
notification to the

350
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
root of trust and then

351
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,639
there are three

352
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,880
remote procedure called

353
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,519
interfaces and the main reference

354
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,199
document

355
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,480
about the rats are mostly uh chara

356
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,720
its name is a young data model for

357
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
challenge response based remote

358
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,480
attestation procedure using ppms and it

359
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,399
is the entity

360
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,880
attestation token

361
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,560
so

362
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
this is the issue that needs to be

363
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,320
discussed and first one is the chart

364
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,120
model of itunes to nsf

365
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,160
and i think uh

366
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,959
people may we need to define which

367
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,040
component we need to trust which we

368
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
don't have to trust and

369
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,160
in the potential recharger which uh paul

370
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
sent to the minimalist and he mentioned

371
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,160
that both the nsf user uh the security

372
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,399
controller itself need to be

373
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,560
a remote attestation i think this is a

374
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
a question

375
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,639
which we need to discuss later uh i

376
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,680
don't have a an obvious answer right now

377
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
so the next issue is about the

378
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,920
granularity of remote station and in

379
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,720
this chapter i think uh i define the

380
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
three layers the first one is the root

381
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,000
of trust then it's a platform then we'll

382
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,320
have different servers that deserve a

383
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,199
remote station

384
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,800
like the platform the platform could be

385
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,920
a traditional os operation system or a

386
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,440
virtualization platform like a

387
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,639
hypervisor

388
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,959
and if the platform does not support

389
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,839
virtualization uh then the asset will be

390
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,120
application or process in the os if the

391
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,920
platform is a hypervisor and think that

392
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,440
the granularity of isf deserve a remote

393
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,279
headstation will be a virtual machine

394
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,079
because i think that in

395
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,360
in some

396
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,559
technology like tpm the vtpm may be not

397
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,400
convincible because it's the

398
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,280
virtualization it's not physical so

399
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,640
we need to

400
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,520
do not use that concept about like a

401
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,359
lack of vtpm

402
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,160
so

403
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
yeah this is a basic information about

404
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,679
draft so is there any comments

405
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,839
i will share share stop sharing a screen

406
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,880
is that okay

407
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
or

408
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,679
what should i do because

409
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
well

410
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,039
this this is

411
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,000
i'm confused are you gonna walk through

412
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,120
the

413
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,480
the decision

414
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,960
questions you had for the working group

415
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,240
at this time or later

416
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,919
i mean you mean the

417
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,720
decision of this draft

418
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,640
so

419
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
paul do you want to comment uh yes

420
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,879
i think yeah uh

421
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,520
very nice representation

422
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,640
uh thank you uh your own

423
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,720
okay sure okay

424
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,880
maybe

425
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,160
so

426
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,400
my comment is i think uh

427
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,640
i checked the uh let's

428
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,679
working group basically they are focused

429
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,400
on

430
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,559
the architectural procedure rather than

431
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,080
some interface young data model so

432
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,400
in order to provide

433
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,200
remote attestation to protect some

434
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,799
inside over

435
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,840
sprite chain attack i think

436
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,840
this work is i think very important also

437
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,720
currently the draft

438
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,919
has a right direction so we take

439
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,520
advantage of the previous our

440
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,720
itunes up to the young data model

441
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,480
and we can

442
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,640
synchronize with

443
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,280
the okay penguins um remote

444
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,039
attestation so

445
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,559
so i think it is a feasible to make also

446
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,000
um improvement

447
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,720
proof using of the future hackathon

448
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,320
project with the

449
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,280
paneling and our group together

450
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,000
okay that's my command thank you

451
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,360
thank you

452
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,960
okay uh roman you joined the queue

453
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,840
i think uh we plan is on the queue first

454
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,799
we pan ahead of me

455
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,600
okay go ahead we pen

456
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,159
uh i i have a um

457
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,760
aging question

458
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,400
and and i think you me

459
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,200
in this draft you mean to do the um

460
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,760
remote attestation for

461
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,720
um the virtualization platform and

462
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,600
as i know um in etsi isd nfv

463
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,080
they are also doing the remote um

464
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,320
develop their standards about the remote

465
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,480
station over

466
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,640
for the nfv so

467
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,760
i i don't know whether um there will be

468
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,840
overlaps

469
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,840
and so i i don't know how how deep um

470
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,039
this uh draft will go

471
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,559
for

472
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,280
about the virtualization

473
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,600
yeah as a virtualization is just one

474
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,039
scenario of our draft i think

475
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,000
and right now i haven't think too deep

476
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
about how to implement the remote

477
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,360
station in the virtualization

478
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,480
environment

479
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,360
and

480
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,840
i'm not sure how i uh actually work

481
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,120
about the

482
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
virtualization draft so i we

483
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,159
i think i can just

484
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,960
research it later and i can't give you a

485
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,760
direct answer right now sorry

486
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,840
okay okay

487
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,480
uh another another question or a comment

488
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,000
is about uh

489
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,360
you mentioned the sassy security access

490
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,480
age and

491
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,840
yeah i i think uh this may be um i don't

492
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,679
have maybe a helpful to be used in

493
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,880
this scenario so yeah but

494
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,600
but i don't know how they can be

495
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,120
implemented or

496
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,039
enhanced because but

497
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,440
if the ideal asset can be used in this

498
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,600
scenario it will

499
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
increase the applicable

500
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,760
um

501
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,520
or deployment in the industrial of i2

502
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,440
and theft so

503
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,200
i think maybe

504
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,280
we could consider this uh in the

505
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,799
recharge yeah

506
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,000
okay

507
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,919
yes i i

508
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,400
i agree to your comment because

509
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,840
i think assassin is a more advanced

510
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,600
technology of beyond the iphone sf but i

511
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,039
think isf is based on the is a flow

512
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,760
based uh network of security function

513
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,640
and the sashi is about the flow-based

514
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,960
and non-flow beta security function so

515
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,280
i'm not sure we can cover these two

516
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,919
different types but i agree with you we

517
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,159
can consider more about the sassy in the

518
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,440
returning thank you

519
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,320
okay roman and then diego

520
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,000
thanks uh thanks for the presentation it

521
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,440
was really helpful to also have the side

522
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,360
by side with uh with the rats and what

523
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,720
you're talking about and the way you

524
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
overlaid the architecture made it really

525
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,200
kind of clear what you're talking about

526
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,919
uh i have no ad hat on here i have two

527
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,880
clarifying questions asked so uh just

528
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,799
i'll ask them back to back so the first

529
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,240
one was

530
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,679
given that we're talking about the

531
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,600
network uh you know virtualized kind of

532
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
network functions i didn't understand

533
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,919
how exactly like you're shimming down to

534
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,559
a tpm without intermediaries and kind of

535
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,280
how the trust model would work given

536
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,039
given those intermediaries was my first

537
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,080
question and then my second question was

538
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,840
uh

539
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,679
there there is some work with the yang

540
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,559
model in chara that appears to be doing

541
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,400
attestation about kind of properties

542
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,159
from the tpm which seems like the same

543
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,679
root of trust that you're talking about

544
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,679
i i didn't understand

545
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,880
you know why that was insufficient

546
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,240
because i mean it's a young model i

547
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,520
guess i figured like you could pull that

548
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,600
out even if you know the the existing

549
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,720
rights architecture is a little

550
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,679
inconvenient as you were kind of

551
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,520
explaining why you just couldn't reuse

552
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,640
the modeling

553
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
thanks yeah the for the first question

554
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,200
is about in the virtualization scenario

555
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,760
and since the tpm is a hardware so the

556
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,279
vtpm may be not trusted so we think that

557
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,279
uh the hypervisor is the operation

558
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,679
system is the platform so we the the the

559
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,360
uh the the vm the virtual machine rides

560
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,320
on that we consider it as as a

561
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,039
maybe a process maybe a match which will

562
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,640
load to the hypervisor and the way when

563
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,400
at the start of the running of the

564
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,279
virtual machine we will uh measurement

565
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,440
the image of that vm so we will

566
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,039
uh

567
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,559
to see if it's trusted and that's my

568
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,120
opinion because i think that the tpm is

569
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,240
not very mature technology so we need to

570
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,200
do not use that yeah and the second

571
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,600
question you mentioned is that china and

572
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,640
i think china is about the how to uh

573
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,120
measurement uh how to measure a device

574
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,400
and it will send like the

575
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
uh email and measurement list to the

576
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,559
verifier but i think that uh

577
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,400
that is not convenient to the nsf

578
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,520
because that

579
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,480
uh in a scenario we may think that there

580
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,600
are three uh assets like there are three

581
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,720
uh uh

582
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,120
accepted in a platform and the first two

583
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,520
attractor and the third is not correct

584
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,880
so we want to uh to challenge the third

585
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,240
one and

586
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,840
when we use the character it's not

587
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,440
convenient because child will send you

588
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,279
all the message of the device it's not

589
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,360
focused on the sf that's what i think

590
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,559
maybe we i'll have to look into the

591
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,600
details

592
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,880
my understanding at least kind of with

593
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,159
on the chair is

594
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,240
yeah and i'm making a modeling

595
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,080
observation rather than an observation

596
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,720
on exactly how rats is using the word i

597
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,240
thought the way that

598
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,039
the ima was shimmed into kind of char

599
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,039
they were actually really flexible on

600
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,039
all the different properties and so all

601
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,200
of ime was in scope which gave you

602
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,640
properties beyond the initial uh

603
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,159
boot level kind of things which they are

604
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,919
saying is that they're trying to get but

605
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,559
i figured that some of that

606
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,400
the network virtualized kind of function

607
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,880
stuff could be shimmed into ima as a

608
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,400
generic modeling thing but i haven't

609
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,760
looked at the specifics enough to say it

610
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,679
sounds like it looks like you asked

611
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,440
yeah i agree with you

612
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,400
and

613
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,640
because because of what you said i

614
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,480
referred a lot information about the

615
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,480
character

616
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,600
well i i assume joao was saying now

617
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,120
diego so

618
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,520
i was trying to to read your lips

619
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
hello thank you

620
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,000
now

621
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,840
if you comment uh

622
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,559
originally set up a step up because of

623
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,440
the comment on on nfv but

624
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,640
there are

625
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
a few others

626
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,279
well regarding nav the what is proposed

627
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,600
here is not incompatible at all with

628
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,240
what that is doing right or what

629
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,720
we said she did some time ago among

630
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,159
other things

631
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,559
because what the t did was precisely to

632
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,600
identify a set of uh of level of

633
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,840
assurance for the procedures for

634
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,760
attesting

635
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,720
infrastructure or functions so probably

636
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,480
we could we could reuse some of the of

637
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,840
the

638
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,159
recommendations there on the levels of

639
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,399
assurance reference them but it's not

640
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,240
going to be incompatible and it would be

641
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,520
a natural revolution

642
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,039
i believe that precisely is the only

643
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,520
other way around whatever we start here

644
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,039
would be uh useful for for lc to refuel

645
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,679
the uh their work in the future but here

646
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,360
i think that the atf for this in

647
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,200
particular is

648
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,240
better suited because the i2nsf

649
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,480
architecture

650
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,039
has this this architecture with the uh

651
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,960
with the controller with the mechanisms

652
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,919
for for verifying etc that goes beyond

653
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,039
what that c

654
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,960
is concentrated that is about the life

655
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,440
cycle of the virtualized environment so

656
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
i i think that this there is i mean for

657
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,159
sure there will be can be or can be some

658
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,559
of small overlaps that isn't something

659
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,600
that would be

660
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,720
uh

661
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,000
easy to solve and for sure there is not

662
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,360
i don't foresee any any uh clear clash

663
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,200
in the future this is one thing the

664
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,640
second thing is regarding this

665
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,480
discussion on chara and the uh

666
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
and the applicability i think that chara

667
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,559
as a mechanism for for request and

668
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,559
response would be totally applicable in

669
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,840
this case

670
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
something else is about the claims and

671
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
how you restructure the claims and how

672
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,320
we structure the verification of the

673
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
claims and who is going to be the

674
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,679
verifier

675
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,440
how policies are going to be expressed

676
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,640
etc in general on monday if i remember

677
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,200
well it was at the tip session

678
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,760
and tip is doing precisely right now

679
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,440
something very similar to what we are

680
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360
proposing here that is

681
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,919
taking rats architecture taking rats

682
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,080
concept taking the format for claims the

683
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,480
protocol etc and saying well look

684
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,240
for verifying from making the

685
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,320
attestation of a trusted execution

686
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,640
environment we will need this we need

687
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,720
that this claim was sufficient this

688
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,200
claim is not going to be sufficient

689
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,039
this kind of analysis is something that

690
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,440
we i mean i believe we have to do here

691
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,159
in the context of what we are that what

692
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,760
we have in place with the security

693
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,159
controller the different capabilities

694
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,440
etc that's

695
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,679
and i think that in that sense

696
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,760
what berlin says is proposing is

697
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
precisely goes in that in that direction

698
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,080
and well that and the proposal is

699
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,199
chapter in that is another source

700
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,720
thank you thank you

701
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,279
so

702
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,520
any more questions on this

703
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,960
so this is

704
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,799
good thank you very much

705
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,880
so now we go to the

706
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,559
next one

707
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,000
which is the

708
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,159
um

709
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,960
paul it's your turn to

710
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,399
can you share the slide from your side

711
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,960
paul can you share the screen

712
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,720
no we can now hear paul right

713
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,880
i cannot hear you

714
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,799
no we can't hear him no

715
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,960
not yet

716
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,960
okay

717
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
i'm not waiting here yeah okay okay can

718
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,440
you see my screen

719
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,399
no

720
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,880
wait okay

721
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,480
you okay great

722
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,080
so let me uh okay explain quickly uh we

723
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,600
have a limited time so i focus on uh the

724
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,960
analysis between consumer page interface

725
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,480
and nsp uh face interface

726
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,120
so this is our framework okay so this is

727
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,600
a consumer phasing interface and this is

728
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,279
an nsf face interface

729
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,320
okay so as you know the control phase

730
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,559
interface is full

731
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,799
okay front end the web

732
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,480
application is used usually uh deliver

733
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,840
high level security policy okay and then

734
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,760
typically um

735
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,919
highly policy can be translated into

736
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,480
rollable security policy by security

737
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,440
controller especially a security

738
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,840
policy translator

739
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,919
and nsf facing interface nfpi is focused

740
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,120
on providing security on detailed

741
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,240
configuration as a low level policy

742
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,919
okay

743
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,159
so

744
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,039
as you can see top level young tree

745
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,640
comparison

746
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
the most of the

747
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,360
element in young module similar okay

748
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,480
except

749
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,559
some description

750
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,919
right so

751
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,480
uh description on case

752
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,880
has omitted but also

753
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,679
the

754
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,720
both

755
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,960
uh cfi and fi

756
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,120
they provide the language tag and the

757
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,720
resolution are strategic okay

758
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,919
however you can see the difference is

759
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:40,720
some

760
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,519
default action play out of key uh usage

761
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,480
okay

762
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,919
so before the action and priority usage

763
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,000
omitted the um from

764
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,360
um tfi because uh our philosophy of gfi

765
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,360
to make cfr as simple as possible to let

766
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,039
a security operator specify high level

767
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,640
policy okay so

768
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,799
those

769
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,279
deposit action and the priority usage

770
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,880
can be

771
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,720
set

772
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,279
by security of policy translator okay

773
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,159
and also shared by end point group and

774
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,039
the threat prevention are used to

775
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,320
register information for a translation

776
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,120
purpose okay

777
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,720
next the low-level young tree are

778
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,360
carried okay so lure our

779
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,840
i2

780
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,559
case event condition action model or eca

781
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,760
right so

782
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,600
you can see even the condition action

783
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,000
okay so here also

784
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,440
event condition action okay so

785
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,559
but the long connection case here this

786
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,399
one is uh

787
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,840
typically used

788
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,399
to allow connection is maintained after

789
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,480
the connection even though there is no

790
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
traffic activity okay

791
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,720
so this kind of time

792
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,280
for um duration allow

793
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,599
the connection is alive even though

794
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,079
there is no actual traffic

795
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,520
so our

796
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,440
phosphate of the gfi

797
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,440
also applies to make

798
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,000
as simple as possible for gfi

799
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,599
okay

800
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,719
next

801
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,639
so and then uh event the case you can

802
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,199
see the sim chip the same this is saved

803
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,320
by this nfl right so description is for

804
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,119
the

805
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,560
operator some human uh letter of

806
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,719
sentences okay so

807
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,760
except that uh the same

808
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
and then this is um

809
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,000
condition so event condition action

810
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,280
right so condition case also

811
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,359
uh you can see

812
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,520
uh

813
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,000
usually uh we specify user group over

814
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,599
divisible can be translated into

815
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,960
error three ip addresses okay used by

816
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,800
the user or device icaderes okay so

817
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,640
those endpoint groups

818
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,280
are used to register

819
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,560
user group device group ip address okay

820
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,040
button 4 or version 6

821
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,160
eventually uh this information stored

822
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,960
in security controller and translated by

823
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,599
spirit controller

824
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,560
and then okay cfy

825
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,200
the msf easy security policy

826
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,920
configuration okay so i

827
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,520
saw right the ip address user device

828
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,720
group

829
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,119
ip addresses are stored into the

830
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,520
database in security control okay and

831
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,880
then some elements in nfi can be handled

832
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,680
by

833
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,359
uh security of policy translator okay

834
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,720
so so i can skip it and then condition

835
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,440
okay so condition case you can see

836
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,520
um

837
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,280
cfi condition and the nfi condition is

838
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,520
you can see the similar

839
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,079
with each other okay even though some

840
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,480
name is a little different but most of

841
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,960
the structure is the same

842
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,040
okay so

843
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,760
but

844
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,119
here note

845
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,760
the restoration of a variable name

846
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,960
here name and actual value

847
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,839
for condition here if i needed to read

848
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,000
a okay

849
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,400
done three controller

850
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,880
for an actual translation uh later okay

851
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,079
so

852
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,320
police translator can handle all those

853
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,920
things

854
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,240
and then um

855
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,720
so you can see uh cfr nfl young data

856
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,520
model similar for some

857
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,920
security attacks okay

858
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,560
ddos etc okay the difference is cfi

859
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,400
some information name and value

860
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,960
confirmation save the database for

861
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,200
easy configuration translation of

862
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,839
purpose okay and also

863
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,599
the name and the value compilation

864
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,599
can be stored so using this kind of xml

865
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,960
expat okay using this so we have this

866
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,119
example for a resolution of name value

867
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,760
for translation properties okay such as

868
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
the employee case they are using ip

869
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,280
addresses linkedin

870
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,359
device group web server case they are

871
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,800
using this kind of

872
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,720
the ip addresses

873
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,680
also

874
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,280
the sls website is this this one is for

875
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,480
the

876
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
database in the

877
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
security and controller for

878
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,960
transformation purpose okay and the next

879
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,560
one is the condition

880
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,800
so you can see condition

881
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,720
is almost the

882
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,200
same you can see the name

883
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,440
is the same description i mentioned the

884
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,359
there is no description

885
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,000
elements in the cfi

886
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,480
okay context contains extra information

887
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,880
especially the filtering of purposes

888
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,680
okay

889
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,040
and then other cases do the same

890
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,079
and then

891
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,960
you can see we have other information

892
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,200
geographic location so geographical

893
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,480
location

894
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,240
name and actual the corresponding ips or

895
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,680
if you address it

896
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,800
either ipv4 or ipv6 okay this also

897
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,200
literation is a

898
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,160
proponent okay

899
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,720
okay can you hear me

900
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,079
yes we can

901
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,520
okay great

902
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,440
so

903
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,599
you can see um

904
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,880
so

905
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,760
the young data model in cfi eventually

906
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,800
the context condition can be a

907
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,640
one-to-one mapped

908
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,079
to context condition in nfi which means

909
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,720
that we can translate okay except some

910
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,440
certain high-level value user group or

911
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,920
device group or geographic

912
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,240
some information can be translated the

913
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,599
specific ip addresses okay that can be

914
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,280
handled by a controller site okay so

915
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,839
time condition geographic

916
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,760
location can be handled okay

917
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,079
so in the action case okay let's move on

918
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,560
so we i explained the event condition

919
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,400
right now action so action case uh

920
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,200
we have a two action in cfi primary

921
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,160
action and secondary action okay usually

922
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,760
primary accident is um you can see

923
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,400
those things okay ingress

924
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,119
eagle action pass drop eject something

925
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,160
like that

926
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,440
and then secondary uh action case um

927
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,079
usually typical example is some logging

928
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,040
okay

929
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,160
so

930
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,200
we can

931
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,960
using

932
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,040
those kinds of packet level action and

933
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,079
the pro level action over advanced

934
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,520
action for dpi or some ddos attack

935
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,920
mitigation case we can

936
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,960
divide it into more detail in

937
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,119
nephi

938
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,720
so

939
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,640
remember also

940
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,280
some cases however cfi

941
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,920
policy tried to for example employee

942
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,000
cannot access some assessor website

943
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,200
during work time so in that case we need

944
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,880
two security services one is a fiver

945
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,119
based on ip addresses the other is web

946
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,240
filtering so those kind of

947
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,839
services can be

948
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,599
combined using uh service function

949
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,240
training in

950
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,680
nfi interface okay

951
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,800
so conclusion there is no translation of

952
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,920
problem from cfi policy

953
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,480
to nfi fallacy

954
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,319
so which means the security controller

955
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,720
can handle those missing

956
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,440
elements such as a deport some action or

957
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,200
priority can be handled by security

958
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,400
control law

959
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,960
and also shfi young data models provide

960
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,839
high level policy for easy configuration

961
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,880
so some detailed information um

962
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,520
register relation over federal name and

963
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,000
value can be done in advance into

964
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,480
database in security control law

965
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,960
and nfl young data model focus on

966
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,280
providing security policy

967
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,240
configuration for nfis

968
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
as a low level policy

969
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,680
okay so that's all so my message is

970
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,720
so cfi and nfi uh

971
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,920
young lady motor are synchronized also

972
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,400
uh can be easily uh translated we are

973
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
demonstrated using

974
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,760
um

975
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,319
the hackathon project so

976
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,599
i believe

977
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,640
now our cfi has a

978
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,960
okay the pre uh material

979
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,319
stage so

980
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,160
we can finish our working group let's

981
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,680
call and then we can

982
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,400
sum it to ies that is my opinion thank

983
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,400
you

984
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,079
so

985
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,599
okay let's move on uh legislation

986
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,000
linda

987
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,520
okay let's move on

988
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,119
okay

989
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,920
let's move on maturation quickly i can

990
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,839
just i finish

991
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,640
okay this one is very short okay uh

992
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,720
restoration interface is based on a

993
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,839
capability young data model because most

994
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:30,880
of

995
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,720
element young

996
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,760
imported from capability so

997
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,400
the resolution you can see

998
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,000
developer management

999
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,480
system registers

1000
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,720
the capability of nsf okay into a

1001
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,800
security controller okay

1002
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,760
so

1003
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,000
also so uh certain cases um

1004
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,920
i don't have to use your

1005
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,599
um to deliver however young um skills

1006
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,560
policy right xml and then there is no

1007
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
such kind of capability

1008
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,319
um

1009
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,480
nsf and then it can query

1010
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,880
okay so and then a developer management

1011
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,240
system are

1012
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,119
so searching that kind of public and the

1013
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,760
leicester again okay so we're providing

1014
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,319
um two things one is a

1015
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,720
quality the other one is uh

1016
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,680
the

1017
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,960
register okay of security

1018
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,599
okay security nsf

1019
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,680
capabilities okay

1020
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,560
so objective over like simulation

1021
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,680
interface

1022
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,440
okay i mentioned right

1023
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,520
uh two um

1024
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,240
the futures okay

1025
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,040
so

1026
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,400
let me move on

1027
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,640
so we have a two things i mentioned the

1028
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,280
nsf capability resolution and the nsf

1029
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,800
capability

1030
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,359
so this is two features okay

1031
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,160
and then we have this um information of

1032
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,920
the model okay

1033
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,280
so

1034
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,800
the regulations have this hierarchy okay

1035
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,960
so

1036
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,280
so nsf capabilities

1037
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,920
is imported by our capability data

1038
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,400
models okay so other cases we also

1039
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,720
providing access information

1040
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,359
such as ip address and the portal number

1041
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,400
for

1042
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,359
nsf okay to provide the

1043
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,839
specific security of

1044
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,560
services okay

1045
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,040
and then and this is the uh young tree

1046
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,079
so

1047
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,319
we import the security capability we

1048
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,440
import okay

1049
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,880
our itunes capability data model okay

1050
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,680
other

1051
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,560
uh performance capability cases

1052
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,800
uh to explain that

1053
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,359
okay capability in terms of some

1054
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,720
processing

1055
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,000
or vendor resistance and inbound or bond

1056
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,319
okay and also access implement i

1057
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,000
mentioned the ip address and photo

1058
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,280
number for

1059
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
nsf okay

1060
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,960
so

1061
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,079
other cases okay quality case also input

1062
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,119
so

1063
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,000
uh given some certain

1064
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,160
quality such as some

1065
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,640
for example web filtering the kind of

1066
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,599
query is the input and then researching

1067
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,880
on this okay

1068
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,319
using this capability data model based

1069
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,560
and then we make some external and then

1070
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,160
we send to

1071
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,680
vms okay and the dms return

1072
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,400
corresponding capability to a security

1073
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,800
controller and the secure controller can

1074
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,000
translate appropriate to

1075
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,359
another facing interface xml okay

1076
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,240
so this is a corey okay

1077
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,119
so this is xml example so

1078
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,400
so we updated the uh restoration

1079
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,920
interface xml example uh based on the

1080
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,000
latest capability

1081
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,359
um our track okay

1082
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,599
so conclusion leisure interface has a

1083
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:02,960
short

1084
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,800
young data model

1085
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,079
based on capability uh young data model

1086
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:08,880
okay

1087
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,160
so this one is almost okay done

1088
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,520
except okay one uh discuss i believe

1089
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,920
that also lifted uh

1090
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,079
up soon okay and then most of the

1091
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,200
changes

1092
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,520
maturation interface just

1093
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,079
um the

1094
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,599
xml

1095
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,400
syntax

1096
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,119
based on capability young data model

1097
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,920
and then additional information um

1098
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,680
capability

1099
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,359
performance information access

1100
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,040
information can be provided by the

1101
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,760
expansion interface okay that's all so

1102
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,760
my conclusion is also literature

1103
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,079
interface also ready to

1104
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,400
submit to ict okay thank you

1105
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,160
thank you very much

1106
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,680
so

1107
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,760
um the registration you're going to

1108
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,160
import some of the capability data model

1109
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,040
right you're going to raise them

1110
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,359
okay yeah exactly yeah

1111
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,960
okay thank you thank you any other

1112
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,400
question from the

1113
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,640
group

1114
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,599
i guess thomas now here he was the one

1115
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,480
complaining about inconsistency so we

1116
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,640
can have to follow up with him on the

1117
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,160
mailing list

1118
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,240
um right

1119
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,359
next we only have 10 minutes left um

1120
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,640
right so

1121
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,520
um for the chartered

1122
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,440
china discussion

1123
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,920
um can you

1124
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,839
you have slides right

1125
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,839
okay i have a slide so

1126
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,880
maybe i share the uh the okay so maybe

1127
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,240
we

1128
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,880
uh okay to me let me give a couple

1129
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,960
minutes so address

1130
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,599
uh what extension is needed and then uh

1131
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,760
so we can discuss okay

1132
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,599
okay so

1133
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,720
so

1134
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,880
contrary uh we imp uh

1135
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,920
okay

1136
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,400
the application interface is required

1137
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,520
because

1138
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,800
uh monitoring interface okay

1139
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,839
pull uh monitoring data from nsf and

1140
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,800
then alternative analyzer

1141
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,839
uh this is a new uh component okay in

1142
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,559
our itunes framework using machine

1143
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,480
learning and then they detect some

1144
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,800
security attack over some

1145
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,839
hardware or software problem uh from nsf

1146
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,760
and then it gives some feedback

1147
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,000
information so we need the application

1148
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,480
interface okay that is a one one thing

1149
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,680
also um

1150
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,480
slides aren't being presented i don't

1151
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,640
think i see it screen sharing is started

1152
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,319
am i the only one

1153
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,119
no oh oh no

1154
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,400
okay so i'm sorry roma so i didn't push

1155
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,960
the okay confirmation button okay yeah

1156
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,720
no no you were clearly talking about

1157
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,480
something but i wasn't seeing it and i

1158
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,839
thought that would be helpful

1159
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,319
okay great thank you so

1160
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,200
okay

1161
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,359
so this is uh the chartering the main

1162
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,200
okay the you all okay

1163
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,559
item is

1164
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,319
to provide

1165
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,040
some security or manage automation such

1166
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,960
as monitoring data okay

1167
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,000
from

1168
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,599
monitoring interface

1169
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,480
to

1170
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,280
alternative analyzer so analyzer this is

1171
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,040
a data collector also performing machine

1172
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,079
learning

1173
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,640
to detect some security attack

1174
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,440
uh from nsf or

1175
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,480
some hardware security or software

1176
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,800
problem and then it gives feedback

1177
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,520
information to

1178
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,559
security controller they can augment

1179
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,920
current

1180
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,119
security policy or they make new

1181
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,440
security policy so in order to that we

1182
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,400
need

1183
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,359
new okay interface or new

1184
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,000
element that is um one

1185
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,280
item

1186
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,640
okay

1187
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,839
so

1188
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,040
eventually we need one interface okay

1189
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,160
so

1190
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,400
i explained okay

1191
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,200
so the goal is that we um okay providing

1192
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,599
security management automation case how

1193
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,920
to extend our framework that is the

1194
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,440
question okay

1195
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,200
and i explained that okay and also

1196
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,079
uh remember the roman uh explain the

1197
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,640
right there is some insider and

1198
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,200
spry chain of tag in our applicability

1199
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,520
uh document right so in order to prevent

1200
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,200
this kind of thing

1201
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,760
we need to somehow remote

1202
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,839
a destination or

1203
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:32,720
we

1204
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,000
need some auditing so maybe we can using

1205
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,839
dlt technology

1206
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,440
okay okay so

1207
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,839
today apparently explained well remote

1208
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,119
attachment okay so other latest system

1209
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,880
technologies

1210
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,000
2kd and the pqc

1211
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,839
dlt so we can uh consider this one uh so

1212
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,200
we can make uh one applicability and use

1213
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,400
cases for those you know

1214
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,880
current uh demands okay

1215
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,520
and then uh we also consider

1216
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,280
nowadays

1217
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,160
there is some migration from

1218
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,839
virtual machine to a container such as a

1219
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,640
cloud native architecture so we need to

1220
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,720
consider how to

1221
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,599
support those kinds of okay container

1222
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,200
deployment okay for itunes so we can

1223
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,359
consider architecture also young data

1224
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,040
model can be

1225
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,680
extended for them

1226
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,040
i have a question on this one so um for

1227
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,119
the container based

1228
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,440
architecture are you talking about

1229
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,079
interface with kubernetes because

1230
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,119
container is normally managed

1231
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,720
controlled by kubernetes right exactly

1232
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,160
yeah

1233
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,880
so container cases

1234
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,119
yes

1235
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,040
okay okay go on so

1236
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,920
okay so container case um

1237
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,000
it is different from um vm virtual

1238
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,400
machine approach so

1239
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,200
uh

1240
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,800
our case young data model this is for

1241
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,680
the virtual maze machine based

1242
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,000
model so we needed to augment somehow

1243
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,800
okay

1244
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,000
that is a

1245
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,400
one input from okay some my collaborator

1246
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,920
and the

1247
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,920
next one is a sport

1248
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,400
listen to the developed protocol such as

1249
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,760
quick and http 3 so during last

1250
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,440
capability um data model and

1251
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,599
the another phasing case

1252
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,280
so

1253
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,359
in order to support this one we need

1254
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,520
some

1255
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,160
extra work so

1256
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,440
that is our another yeah score

1257
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,040
so in order to okay certify those

1258
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,319
demands and we can extend our framework

1259
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,040
okay for spirit to manage automation

1260
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,160
so we can make application interface

1261
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,760
and also

1262
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,000
translation is actually important you

1263
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,400
can see we can provide some

1264
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,359
um some architecture also some

1265
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,480
uh procedure also mapping

1266
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,720
uh structure between high library young

1267
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,680
data model and low level young model so

1268
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,000
loma mentioned that the algorithm itself

1269
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,880
not standard right but we can provide

1270
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,880
some framework for our speed

1271
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,200
transformation case i believe

1272
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,920
uh is useful so we can decide the policy

1273
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,359
the rfs or not we can decide later on

1274
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,520
and the remote or destination we can

1275
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,559
work on

1276
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,760
and also

1277
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,880
sport

1278
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,240
dlt based on distributed system auditing

1279
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,240
to prevent the supply chain and the

1280
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,680
inside attack

1281
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,720
and then

1282
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,760
i transfer for container deployment we

1283
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,480
can

1284
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,559
also we can work on it

1285
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,000
also applicability and use cases for

1286
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,400
security managed automation including

1287
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,680
the latest

1288
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,559
the quantum computing

1289
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,400
something like that also some actually

1290
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,000
okay network

1291
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,240
the inside computing technology we can

1292
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,760
consider

1293
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,880
and then

1294
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,319
our next uh three case we can extend our

1295
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,559
current nsf phasing

1296
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,520
capability consumer pacing

1297
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,119
to accommodate

1298
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,000
the

1299
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,800
new

1300
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,240
protocols okay so we can uh maybe uh

1301
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,000
revise later on

1302
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,480
so there is a milestone okay so i just

1303
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,760
make some estimation here okay that's

1304
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,839
all

1305
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,799
thank you so

1306
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,760
there's a lot of lots of things to do um

1307
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,839
any comments from the questions from the

1308
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,839
group

1309
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,440
okay

1310
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,480
um

1311
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,599
so um for the i just have one comment oh

1312
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,520
roman you have comments

1313
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,079
please do

1314
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,799
no i mean diego i'm going to drop out of

1315
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,400
diego has things to say i want to hear

1316
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,280
from the community uh so let me drop out

1317
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,119
and have the community talk here

1318
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,079
okay sorry sorry for the for the delay

1319
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,280
but i had to unblock the uh the phone

1320
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,440
etc to raise my hand and

1321
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,240
things are complicated in these days

1322
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,359
basically it was uh i wanted just to uh

1323
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,559
to to

1324
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,880
make a remark on what linda was saying

1325
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,880
about the containers and all the like

1326
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,440
especially

1327
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,920
that in general when you start to start

1328
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,920
talking about containers basically what

1329
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,640
you

1330
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,040
is i have here several times oh well but

1331
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,119
this kubernetes take care of these and

1332
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,079
that

1333
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,040
precisely we are assuming here and we

1334
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,040
are implying in the in all the process a

1335
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,200
particular trust model in which you have

1336
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,960
the controller you have the capabilities

1337
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,640
you have how you expose the capabilities

1338
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,040
you make decision on that

1339
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,720
i am under the belief that the the use

1340
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,079
of uh

1341
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,280
of course of containers and the uh the

1342
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,599
fact that you can even

1343
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,520
decompose functionalities in in uh in

1344
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,559
smaller pieces both imply or would

1345
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,079
require some changes and some of the

1346
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:27,040
assumptions

1347
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,119
that we have i mean it's not that have

1348
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,400
the the the

1349
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,640
solution or it's clear to me in which

1350
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,720
aspects but i think that we have to

1351
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,400
rethink some of the

1352
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,640
of the aspects in the architecture to

1353
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,240
really match

1354
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,280
what is what implies the kubernetes

1355
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,040
services uh lambdas and all the like

1356
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,200
and and think about how we can reason

1357
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,280
about uh security functions and under

1358
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,920
deployment so i believe that this is uh

1359
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,079
that makes the whole thing

1360
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:56,880
uh

1361
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,640
more challenging and let me insist when

1362
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,079
it comes to at the station et cetera

1363
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,559
we're talking precisely about adapting

1364
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,280
the the architecture that rats is

1365
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,559
proposing to this particular case and to

1366
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,079
something that is equally important that

1367
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,680
is precisely the automation part the uh

1368
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,000
the uh box i go

1369
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,079
right now the analyzer

1370
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,160
how the analyzer perform the analysis

1371
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,680
and how you can trust as well the

1372
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,118
analyzer and what the analyzer decides

1373
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,200
thank you

1374
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,319
any other questions i think we are

1375
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,559
reaching the end

1376
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,280
three more minutes

1377
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,920
roman

1378
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,559
hi uh

1379
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,480
so very interested to hear kind of what

1380
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,319
the community thinks about that of this

1381
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,599
list of work

1382
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,760
my initial so first also thank you paul

1383
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,319
like you doing the voiceover with the

1384
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,760
slides was actually very helpful in

1385
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,119
learning what you put in the text so

1386
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,559
that's actually i think that's very

1387
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,680
helpful to kind of facilitate the

1388
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,839
conversation my initial reaction to this

1389
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:14,880
is

1390
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,880
there are definitely hard problems here

1391
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,200
being enumerated this seems like a very

1392
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,760
very large

1393
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,839
and it almost seems like in each i mean

1394
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,280
this is my initial kind of first boss

1395
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,960
reaction of hearing the talk it seems

1396
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,119
like some every one of those programs of

1397
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,680
work is almost a working group uh you

1398
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,920
know we talked most about one exact one

1399
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,839
specific one about orchestration of

1400
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,480
containers that that particular thing

1401
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,359
seems

1402
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,040
there's a lot of details of that there's

1403
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,880
a lot of choices that brings together a

1404
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,440
lot of things to the itf doing a

1405
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,079
distributed ledger uh i mean we have a

1406
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,359
whole other working group where we're

1407
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,359
talking about doing that for supply

1408
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,200
chain risk management as well so these

1409
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,520
seem like very big topics

1410
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,319
and

1411
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:59,359
to tie this into what i said before

1412
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,839
we're six and a half years into trying

1413
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,920
to deliver our first tranche of things i

1414
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,680
know we're getting close but we're still

1415
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,920
six and a half years we didn't do it so

1416
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,760
i would urge the working group to

1417
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,559
continue talking about these and try to

1418
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,319
really think through what scope will

1419
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,559
want to tackle first and what what

1420
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,559
bandwidth is there to tackle out of

1421
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,119
those dopes

1422
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,759
thank you

1423
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,359
very very very fast

1424
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:31,520
uh it's uh i i i i agree with roman that

1425
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,200
from time to time i mean the temptation

1426
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,839
of this famous uh term avoiding the

1427
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,400
ocean and whatever that we whatever the

1428
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,359
endeavor that we start is there

1429
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,359
the point is that uh

1430
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,599
you you say with roman it's a

1431
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,680
is the fact that the idea is not to

1432
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,000
invent a new way of using dlts so it is

1433
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,680
not a new way of inventing how to use uh

1434
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,400
uh at the station et cetera especially

1435
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,559
leverage of what many other groups are

1436
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,040
doing and trying to profile it for the

1437
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,599
case i mean we are going to i mean

1438
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,440
if you ask me for sure i will try to

1439
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,599
climb on the on the shoulder of giants

1440
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,880
as uh as uh sir isaac did some time i

1441
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,599
ago precisely with the idea of free

1442
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,400
reusing all the work that is there and

1443
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,640
using it for enhancing the the

1444
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,559
architecture that's basically yeah

1445
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,040
we can for sure we can we should

1446
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,119
elaborate a little bit more in terms of

1447
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,720
priorities

1448
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,240
for sure

1449
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,640
okay very good thank you thank you so

1450
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,160
much

1451
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,599
thank you

1452
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,480
so i think we have reached our limit for

1453
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,640
this meeting well thank you everybody

1454
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,280
it's very interesting informative

1455
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,400
session

1456
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,920
and we will continue on the mailing list

1457
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,079
especially on the

1458
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,799
priority of the next seven works to be

1459
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:57,119
done by the working group as roman said

1460
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,440
we shouldn't make it too big and make it

1461
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,680
manageable thank you

1462
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,319
so much thank you

1463
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,559
i think with this you'll have to okay

1464
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,400
there are actually

1465
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
people willing to do the work there's

1466
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,240
22 people in the room i'm not talking

1467
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,240
about the physical room

1468
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,480
the whole meeting there's 22 people and

1469
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,720
the conversation here has pretty much

1470
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,079
mostly been

1471
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:21,839
three people

1472
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,640
if we don't count chairs and babies

1473
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,680
it's three people

1474
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,440
and well there's a suit who

1475
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,520
didn't speak up but she is acting on the

1476
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,480
mailing list other than that were

1477
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,440
pretty much don't have people

1478
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,359
but okay i guess we need to discuss this

1479
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:43,040
