1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,319
i have a wrong

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,639
eddie there now

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,200
oh because i i it was valid when i wrote

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,040
the trout or the slides

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,080
i'm not going to change it now

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,440
okay guess it's now

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,879
12 30 so we should be getting started

8
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,760
so this slightly second me working group

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,440
and i'm there

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,480
and my

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,800
co-chair is also online

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,000
i don't know

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
yeah there he is

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,920
and your culture is telling you to speak

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,039
up or closer to the mic

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,039
all right so i will

17
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,080
move close to the mic

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,240
what where's your pink wall

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,720
yeah okay

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,840
so

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,080
our responsible lady is no longer

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,560
benjamin kharook is now a roman

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,200
who is probably also oh he's i can see

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
him

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,040
he's not online

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,880
but anyway so

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,200
let's go forward then

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,119
so this is the note well

29
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,720
it's pretty have probably noted well

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,840
already

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
for at least this point of view and

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
we don't need to have blue seats because

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
they are taking automatically care of uh

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,640
if you use the meat echo either the

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,880
online you know version or the full

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,840
version

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,280
if you're using full version make sure

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
you might mute out the audio

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
uh peter already agreed to take notes

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,479
but it would be useful to have somebody

41
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,280
else also helping him in case he

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,360
misses something and i don't think we

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,799
actually need the choppers right i would

44
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,119
try to try to you know

45
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,120
check the chamber myself also because i

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,959
can detach it now so it's much more

47
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,080
easier

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
to do that

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
and there's links for jabber and mitako

50
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,800
and

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,440
notes the notes the kodiami notes

52
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,080
already had the template for the

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
uh for for the systems

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,280
oh you said it was sounded better before

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
i getting close to the mic now you can

56
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,840
actually hear me

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,360
alright so

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,120
we have a

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,280
quite short agenda and two hours for it

60
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,319
so

61
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,519
we will have plenty of time

62
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
so we have two presentations today one

63
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,040
is the group key management for ice

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,400
version 2

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
and the other one is the optional sa and

66
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,480
ts payloads in child

67
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,480
exchange

68
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
all right so

69
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,000
any comments on the agenda any bashing

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,200
you want to do with agenda

71
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,120
any technical difficulties we need to

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,720
take care of before we start

73
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
this is the odds and i need to do that

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
all right so working group report what

75
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,760
is the current status so we have now uh

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,920
icos and two intermediate which i think

77
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
was actually approved a couple of days

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,799
ago

79
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,760
so it says in rfc editor queue

80

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,280
uh

116
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,360
is my voice working

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
hopefully yeah great i just wanted to

118
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
mention that we um

119
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,160
we are starting work on uh linux

120
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,639
implementation of the uh

121
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,320
iptfs and so just wanted to add some

122
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
maybe a little bit of you know

123
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,840
push

124
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,759
uh i know it's not in your guys's hands

125
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,600
anymore but i don't i don't know if is

126
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,680
it ben that has to still sign off on it

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,160
or has it shifted to roman now it's

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,320
shifted to romans roman will be checking

129
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,000
it out i don't know

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
how long his cue is but of course you

131
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
have to understand that probably all the

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,560
stuff that moved from roman to him are

133
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
might be ending up in the end of the

134
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,080
queue not in the beginning or he might

135
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,639
be talking by the date i don't know it

136
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,160
depends on the throwing throwing them

137
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
all up again and seeing where they fall

138
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,720
who knows yeah okay um yes

139
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,080
i think he noticed that some of those

140
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,680
have been in queue quite a long time and

141
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
he was a little bit surprised for that

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,039
so i think he might be actually

143
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,880
prioritizing some of those yeah that

144
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,919
would be great um yeah so uh just yeah

145
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,440
so we're doing that it'd be great if we

146
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,000
could reference an rfc rather than draft

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
when we uh you know go to submit a patch

148
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,479
set to linux

149
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,800
all right thanks okay thanks

150
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,120
okay

151
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,720
so

152
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
so this is more detailed

153
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
as i said the group key management for

154
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
using like version 2.

155
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,400
we did get you know a new version of

156
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,919
that and it should be

157
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,520
you know it's still on the vacuum pro

158
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,720
blast call because i didn't want to

159
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
close it because there was so little

160
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,600
reviews on that

161
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,360
but i will close it after this meeting

162
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
and if if i don't get any other comments

163
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
on that then i will still

164
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,199
put it out and post it there because i

165
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,600
want to get it out it's not really we

166
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,479
inherited this document from msec

167
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,360
and it's just mostly there to try to get

168
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,800
so that people can actually use like

169
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
version 2

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
through these things that they are using

171
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,000
now like version 1 to do and and we want

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,680
to get you know

173
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,639
uh

174
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,440
has some comments on that

175
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,919
um

176
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,599
hello i just want to say that i think

177
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,599
you are very quiet

178
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,720
oh

179
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,639
should i uh can you hear me

180
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,479
something wrong i don't know

181
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,720
no it's it's it's simply getting louder

182
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
now a little bit

183
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,479
so i think that uh one more route and

184
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
review is needed because there are some

185
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,919
uh

186
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,400
issues that

187
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
will definitely require publication of a

188
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,520
new version

189
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,800
uh and i will discuss

190
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
them in my presentation

191
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,199
uh so i think that you could even if you

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,840
close uh last call after this meeting

193
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,919
assumes that one more round review is

194
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,120
needed

195
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
okay so i will wait anyway for at least

196
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,599
one more revision before i

197
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,400
put it forward all right good but

198
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,879
so that's the status and then i did guys

199
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,800
we could actually go to the presentation

200
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,879
and you are the first one to talk about

201
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,400
the group key management using our

202
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,560
question too so valerie if you just

203
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,520
go ahead and they want to actually i

204
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,160
will pass you the slides i think you can

205
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,120
oh

206
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,879
[Music]

207
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,199
slide control oh

208
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,720
i see so you know you should be able to

209
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,199
try the slides yourself

210
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,159
so can you hear me

211
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,399
is this sound

212
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,799
good enough or should i speak even

213
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,199
loudly

214
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,039
i think it's okay

215
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,279
okay

216
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,159
so well

217
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,560
i think that's complete

218
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,279
ah this is it so the comment status uh

219
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,640
a version file was published uh just in

220
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,120
march a few days ago

221
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
just before this atf because i missed

222
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,760
the deadline and

223
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,040
need to ask a secretary to publish it

224
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,600
and uh it is uh

225
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,800
it has it can contains just quite a lot

226
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,920
of changes from the uh version 4

227
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,519
as a result of

228
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,880
terrorist review

229
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,160
and i will now discuss uh the

230
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,040
the remaining issues and quickly

231
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
uh

232
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,880
release the issues that are resolved

233
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,120
so these issues that are resolved in

234
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
this version

235
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,120
so terra asked for a

236
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,360
terminology section and i have added one

237
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,320
and i mostly borrowed all the terms from

238
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,560
second judo documents and is

239
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
probably

240
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,040
choose

241
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,800
which which definition are the best

242
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
because they differ slightly

243
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,480
and so i do my best and i think

244
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,720
that

245
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,240
people should review it and uh

246
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,320
and said whether it is enough or some

247
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,880
more definitions are needed

248
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,320
so uh

249
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
again uh the other issue another issue

250
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,680
is that terror asked for it is clarified

251
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,480
that icos and jsaos exchanges are

252
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,920
almost the same

253
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,440
regarding to iq2 extensions so gsa also

254
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
will inherit all the extensions that are

255
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,040
applicable to icos exchanges

256
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,279
besides probably

257
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,760
with exceptions that

258
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,120
some exchange that are only related to

259
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,839
uh ibisec and not

260
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,120
well to unicast episode but generally

261
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,959
they are the same exchanges despite that

262
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,600
they have a different exchange types

263
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,800
they are very similar and will uh

264
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,760
all the exchanges that can be

265
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,560
applied to gsr oath that are defined for

266
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,839
icos

267
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,320
will automatically be inherited

268
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,399
so we don't need to to write a separate

269
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,440
document

270
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,279
just to say that this exchange this

271
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,600
extension is also applicable to disables

272
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,640
uh then uh keys used inside their ksa

273
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,320
are renamed

274
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,720
uh because again tara says that it's

275
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,000
confusing

276
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,920
they're renamed uh

277
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,720
from esca

278
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
w gsk

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,920
w so it's

280
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
from shared key to group shared key i

281
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,519
think i think it's it's a good

282
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,680
suggestion

283
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,720
uh

284
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,440
again estero suggested

285
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
the change in authentication method and

286
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,560
altercation key is now prohibited

287
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,399
for the lifetime of group security

288
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,079
association so uh when group controller

289
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,040
kcra performs her key

290
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
it provides a group with a new policy

291
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
but this policy cannot

292
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,880
change

293
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,720
uh authentication method that

294
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,480
authenticates these recuperations so if

295
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,399
group control kiser

296
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,839
selected that it is difficult digital

297
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
signatures from the very beginning it

298
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,000
will be digital uh

299
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,360
signature

300
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,880
uh up to the end of group uh security

301
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
association lifetime

302
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
i think it's

303
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,800
it's also a good idea it will make

304
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,519
sense more robust in my opinion

305
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,639
and

306
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,399
then using

307
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,320
using sender ids clarified

308
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,200
and in particular in more detail this

309
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
situation with a group control key

310
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,480
server

311
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,600
runs out from available seats and need

312
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,040
to

313
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,440
band the group and rejoin it is uh

314
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,279
defined in more detail described in more

315
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,680
details situation

316
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,079
and in general consistency document is

317
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,560
improved and a lot of qualification is

318
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,800
added because it was

319
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,519
previously it was a leftovers from

320
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,880
previous versions and i tried to

321
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,440
charge them and make the document more

322
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,079
consistent

323
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,519
so

324
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,959
there are still

325
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,440
a list of unresolved issues

326
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
here is the list and i will go and

327
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,320
in the following following slides and

328
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,839
just describe

329
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,360
each

330
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,000
issue in more detail

331
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,480
so

332
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,320
we can change

333
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,440
authentication method or key for ksa

334
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,079
during the operations during multicast

335
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,360
operations

336
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,680
but is it easy to allow it to change

337
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,279
authentication key

338
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,079
public key for example

339
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,639
group controller q7

340
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,920
starts

341
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,160
with public key 1

342
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,800
and in the middle of the lifetime of

343
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,120
group

344
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
group say

345
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,639
it

346
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,800
in one of their key operations in

347
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,360
multicast operations it provides group

348
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,639
with a new

349
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,480
public key

350
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,680
well

351
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,079
now it is prohibited

352
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,800
in the current version

353
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,240
but i think i need more opinion on that

354
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,880
well anyway uh for the for the remaining

355
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,079
for

356
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,560
for the remaining slides uh everything

357
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,800
that is in blue

358
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,519
is my opinion or something that is

359
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,120
already in the draft

360
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,079
so and i also want to hear

361
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,639
i'll be very glad if people can comment

362
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,639
just uh online

363
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,279
on the issues because i tried to to nail

364
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,720
down these to the small pieces and

365
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,920
sometimes

366
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
the decision at least some opinion can

367
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,880
be collected right now so if you have an

368
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,920
opinion

369
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,480
please speak up

370
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,680
so for me just to know

371
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,079
so any opinions on that

372
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,560
no opinions

373
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,880
okay

374
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,759
let's go further

375
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
so

376
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,720
using ports

377
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,639
judo used port

378
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,800
848 and for compatibility with judo jiq

379
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,519
2 also allows to use this port

380
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,360
however uh

381
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
we discussed with brian

382
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,839
a few years ago and he suggested that

383
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,240
standard iq 2 ports 500 for 500 i will

384
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,120
sell out because now gi quick 2 is

385
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
treated as more as uh liquid to

386
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,800
extension

387
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,839
it is

388
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,000
a big extension complex one but it's

389
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,480
just an equity extension

390
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
so as well as using tcp

391
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,759
and one question should the unicast type

392
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
says which if if port 842 is used

393
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,519
uh should the unicast xsa switch from

394
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,120
this port to for 500 if not is detected

395
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,959
so my opinion yes

396
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,040
but

397
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,519
watch other things

398
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,519
uh this is they're not giving a

399
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,600
commenting in notation share but

400
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,320
you know

401
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,000
i think we should we

402
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,040
need to

403
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,000
move to portfolio 4500 because we want

404
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,759
to have a different uh format with

405
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,959
having the

406
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,639
you know the european capsules of our

407
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,360
esp and uh for ike so i don't think

408
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
there's an option not to move

409
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
we could have a more option to move some

410
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,600
other port and you know

411
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,160
but we need to have some way to identify

412
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,559
whether it's in using this uh

413
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,280
four four bytes in the beginning or not

414
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,880
uh well and port for 500 will always

415
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,799
indicate that uh yes non-like non-usb

416
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,520
prefix is present

417
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,160
yes bug fought for for esp

418
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,599
but if it if you talk about i can say

419
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,839
uh there's no difference

420
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,069
in format from

421
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,600
[Music]

422
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,360
whichever port you use

423
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,640
so uh and for esp we are talking now

424
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,760
about unicast like i say from

425
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,000
uh

426
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,960
group member to group controller the

427
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,600
registration say so if it starts from

428
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,160
fourth eight four eight should and not

429
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,679
is detected

430
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,600
should it move to port

431
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,120
for five hundred

432
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,159
well it is it is

433
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
there's no is psa between them but we

434
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,520
can move just to make

435
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,679
i don't know just to keep

436
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,559
the same logic as it for ip2

437
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,039
actually i was wondering do we do we

438
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,559
think that the multicast things are

439
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,400
going to work if there's not in the

440
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,440
middle

441
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
uh it's another question it will be in

442
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,200
the next slide it's the next okay okay

443
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,960
so

444
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,000
if nobody objects then i think that uh i

445
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,320
think that it is a i i will see that we

446
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,280
we should move to port 4 500 just to

447
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,640
keep the logic

448
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,679
uh the same regardless on the weather

449
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,640
port 848 or 500 is used from the very

450
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,040
beginning

451
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,120
[Music]

452
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,000
so the next

453
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,960
some architectural question

454
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,120
should we allow a registration a group

455
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,840
member from the group

456
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,200
so

457
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,919
i don't have strict opinion

458
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,840
because

459
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,799
in most cases

460
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,760
this group control kisera doesn't care

461
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,919
about

462
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,320
the population of the group because

463
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,799
most operations are multicast and you

464
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,640
don't know how many

465
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,679
uh

466
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,799
how many

467
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,080
members of the group are currently

468
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
subscribed to it

469
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,080
but in some cases

470
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
this may be useful

471
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,559
uh in particular if

472
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,760
some key management method like linear

473
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
key hierarchy

474
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,400
lkh is used in this case a group

475
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,919
controller k7 need to keep

476
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,640
a trace of all the members of the group

477
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,039
just to know

478
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,440
which member it can exclude from the

479
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,520
group for example

480
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,960
and in this case if a group member can

481
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,919
explicitly say well i'm leaving

482
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,559
this will allow to keep some resources

483
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,320
or group control like a survey but

484
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,919
anyway it's it's

485
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,520
it's unreliable

486
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,320
it can just leave and say nothing

487
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,840
so i don't have strict opinion

488
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,080
and if somebody has one

489
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,678
i i i'll be glad to hear

490
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
so no opinion

491
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,720
well

492
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,799
okay

493
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,440
let's go further

494
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,240
so just uh there were two error

495
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,679
modification uh related to well there

496
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,200
are more but two

497
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,960
there are three error modifications that

498
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,720
are related to

499
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
group by q2

500
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,760
is group id

501
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,039
not found

502
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,559
it's very clear when to send it to send

503
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,880
one group member quest to journey groups

504
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,480
it doesn't exist

505
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,520
and

506
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,240
the other two are more

507
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
um

508
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
a little less clear so austerization

509
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,159
failed and registration failed and the

510
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,320
registration filed initially wasn't in

511
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,559
the draft it was suggested to it

512
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,039
by brian again a few years ago

513
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,600
and at the time we didn't discuss

514
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,360
the distinction between these two

515
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,679
notifications and i think it's very

516
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,039
clear it must be a clear

517
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,880
clear fight it must be clarified to

518
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,440
which uh error notification to send

519
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,080
where so my interpretation uh which is

520
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,400
currently is draft is that authorization

521
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,080
failed is used when something is wrong

522
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,159
with group member so it is not

523
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,039
authorized to join this group

524
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,960
and registration files should be sent if

525
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
something wrong with the group itself so

526
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,039
it existed but but some for some reason

527
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,480
group control k7 cannot

528
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,960
add more members to this group

529
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
for example

530
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
group capacity is exceeded if the group

531
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,200
has some fixed capacity or something

532
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,520
something else is wrong

533
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,400
so

534
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,480
is it okay for the community is this

535
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,200
interpretation

536
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,360
so nobody objects

537
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,640
okay

538
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,520
let's go further

539
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,639
um

540
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,679
this question was erased

541
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,640
during in in terrorist review

542
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,960
so we have in fact we have three

543
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,799
authentication modes

544
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,840
for for multicast key operations

545
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,400
uh in jk2 the first is vertically it's a

546
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,679
public

547
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,440
key signature

548
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,480
and it's it's everything is okay with it

549
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,679
and uh there are two uh authentication

550
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,039
methods that

551
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,760
involve uh using shared secret

552
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,679
and first is an explicit shared

553
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,440
key authentication

554
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,200
well it is very limited of course it is

555
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,960
very limited because there is no origin

556
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,919
authentication and every member of the

557
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,200
group can

558
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,280
impersonate group controller case ever

559
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
in this situation so it must be used for

560
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,039
the very small groups

561
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,600
with highly trusted participants but

562
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,080
still it is very handy because it

563
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,280
it's very

564
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,640
uh

565
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,760
resource

566
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,200
and consuming

567
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,320
but

568
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
there are two types of this notification

569
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,159
first if we have an explicit psk that is

570
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,960
provided to the group members by group

571
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,720
control k7

572
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,559
when the group member registers to the

573
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,679
group

574
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,320
and the other it was introduced later

575
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,360
just came to my mind that it can be done

576
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,200
is just as ability and ability for the

577
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,159
growth member to uh correctly decrypt

578
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,559
and verify the icb of the rookie message

579
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,760
uh is uh uh

580
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
and

581
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,480
it

582
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,840
allows the group member to

583
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,159
to be known that it is in the group so

584
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,480
it authenticates it

585
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
the the message that

586
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
it received

587
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,159
is authenticated by the fact that a

588
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
group member having its current key

589
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,000
can

590
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
correctly decrypt and verify the suv so

591
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,600
it's an exp implicit implicit

592
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,080
shared key authentication

593
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,919
and

594
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,559
it has well there were very similar but

595
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,799
there is a difference with explicit

596
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,840
character

597
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,640
uh

598
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,600
authentication there is a dedicated

599
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,360
symmetric character

600
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,279
that is used for authentication

601
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,000
and that group controller

602
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,480
provides

603
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,440
transfers to group members and within

604
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,320
places there is no dedicated charity key

605
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,520
every key operation which change uh

606
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,760
keys that are used to protect multicast

607
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
tricky messages

608
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,679
uh will change this authentication key

609
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,640
so

610
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,440
this key are used for

611
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,279
the fact

612
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,320
that

613
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,279
the message is authenticated

614
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,679
and so there is now always below in this

615
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,799
case

616
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,279
so terror suggested to remove an

617
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,440
explicit shared key authentication

618
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,520
because again they're very similar

619
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,360
and the difference is only whether we

620
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,000
have a dedicated uh

621
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,919
shared key or not

622
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,120
and i don't have a strict opinion

623
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,200
i think that if uh

624
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,679
if you have some long life

625
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,440
shared keys that it used for

626
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,320
authentication only that it's probably

627
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,200
for some reason this key is selected

628
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,360
and uh

629
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,480
otherwise this key are just

630
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,919
automatically generated usually

631
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,559
automatically generated and i changed

632
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,640
very frequently so i have no strict

633
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,000
opinion so i want to hear from

634
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
others what they think so tara

635
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
yeah so this is

636
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
not the chair so one of the things i

637
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
think that is a

638
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,279
difference there is really that okay if

639
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,279
you have a two keys

640
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,799
then you can change change the you know

641
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,640
king keys uh

642
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,760
you know you can change the

643
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,000
authentication case faster

644
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,200
than the

645
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,720
you know the keys to protect the

646
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,400
messages but i don't think it's actually

647
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,840
going to be the case that you would

648
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
actually want to do the other way around

649
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,760
usually so

650
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,919
and you can change you know the

651
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,919
key that you encrypt the pocket uh

652
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
faster than the other degrees of keys

653
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,520
because you you can't actually see the

654
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,600
authentication keys unless i mean

655
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,000
even if you miss some pockets and not

656
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,279
get update

657
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,640
if you don't know get down the

658
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
encryption key you can't read the packet

659
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,240
so even if the authentication is the

660
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,400
same it doesn't help you at all

661
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,080
so i was thinking about they are

662
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,720
in in my sense they are exactly same in

663
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,279
in a point of view you know usage and

664
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,600
having it simple more simple and you

665
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,159
know less options is always better so i

666
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,320
would actually say just keep only one

667
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,120
and

668
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,200
get rid of the you know having the

669
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,799
explicit outer dating key there because

670
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,960
i don't think it buys us anything it

671
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,480
just makes it more complicated

672
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,679
well

673
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,279
i know your opinion

674
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,039
well actually i don't disagree i just

675
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,960
want to hear from

676
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,919
just

677
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,120
from others to to

678
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,720
to be more sure

679
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,799
to make more confidence in the decision

680
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,279
okay

681
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,279
if no one objects then i will eliminate

682
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,520
an explicit

683
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,720
pressured key authentication and

684
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,600
will

685
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,080
leave only implicit one

686
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,799
to simplify since

687
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,159
in the next version

688
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,360
okay

689
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,679
an interesting topic an extended

690
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,640
sequence number so i just realized that

691
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,840
it is

692
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,200
quite uh

693
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,559
challenging to use extended

694
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,120
circumstances multicast to say

695
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,760
because high order 32 bits are never

696
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,240
transmitted and

697
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,440
if uh

698
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,000
group member joins the group

699
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,360
late

700
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,640
well a long late when it is created

701
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,279
uh it is not it doesn't know as we need

702
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,919
to provide it with uh and

703
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,799
high order beats

704
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,799
and

705
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,080
or it should somehow

706
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,520
guess

707
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,679
and there are algorithms in

708
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,440
rfc 3302 and 303 but they were research

709
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
consuming

710
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,679
so

711
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,320
should we

712
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,039
provide well we cannot provide how

713
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,200
debate but because group control key

714
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,440
server doesn't know it so it is not an

715
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,600
option

716
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,120
only

717
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,840
group centers no high audi beat

718
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,159
so the only option is that

719
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,960
group member the receiving group member

720
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,760
uh

721
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,320
runs algorithm

722
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,360
defined in rfc

723
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,679
402403 to know these

724
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,600
high order beats and it is very

725
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,760
consuming so

726
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,240
should we not recommend to use csn

727
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,720
should we prohibit it's using

728
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,440
so terror

729
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
so they're okay so i think we can

730
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,159
actually there is also we could also put

731
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,559
them into the actual when we are sending

732
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,440
the key materials to the you know uh or

733
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,200
updating the key materials or the keys

734
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,039
we could also you know

735
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,840
send and update the highest you know 32

736
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,760
bits of the es and

737
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,000
so so in that case even if somebody

738
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,679
joins a lathe and misses some frames

739
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,080
they can still do the very short search

740
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,960
of the

741
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,399
higher order bits

742
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,120
no we can't because uh group controller

743
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,960
key server sends their key

744
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,880
and it doesn't know it is not the center

745
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,200
it doesn't know which is the current

746
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,559
uh which is the current relationship

747
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,399
because it might not be part of the

748
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,720
group itself yes even if

749
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,320
yes it might be another part of the

750
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,200
group at least for uh for data security

751
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,880
say it is all

752
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,200
it is always part of the group for a gsa

753
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,080
but for data security

754
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,760
so it doesn't know

755
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,000
um

756
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,520
um

757
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,720
yeah actually i had the same question as

758
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,240
terror so thanks for answering that um i

759
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,480
just want to say like you should not

760
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,640
that must not because there might just

761
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,279
be high-speed uh applications that

762
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,120
really rely on this

763
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,000
um otherwise they get too many re-keys

764
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,720
so

765
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,120
i disagree with must not um

766
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,279
i might even disagree with it i might

767
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,120
not even agree with should not

768
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,480
but what what what what i suggest

769
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,720
which i suggest

770
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,480
well i guess the only option then is the

771
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,440
resource consuming method of finding out

772
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,399
okay

773
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,120
so we should just clarify it in the

774
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,840
draft and say that

775
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,679
it's up to

776
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,600
it's up to your environment right

777
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,320
okay

778
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,240
the next one

779
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,159
so integration with uh ppk

780
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,279
uh

781
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,399
the previous version of the draft

782
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,279
was where a beaten correct with sister

783
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,399
got and terra correctly point me

784
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,360
that uh it was mistakenly

785
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,880
uh

786
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,320
interpreted that uh keys that are

787
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,039
transferred in gsa os

788
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,240
are

789
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,320
not protected by ppk

790
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,640
uh it's it's wrong

791
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,360
they are protected but by ppk but only

792
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,720
partially

793
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,440
so uh

794
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,799
they are encrypted with

795
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,640
jskw

796
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,519
which is derived from the skd and this

797
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,039
kde is pro is is

798
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,159
derived

799
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,840
with ppk involved

800
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,000
so they encrypt the key the key is the

801
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,799
multicast keys that are transferred to

802
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,159
gm i encrypted with the key that depends

803
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,399
on ppk and it's good

804
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,360
but

805
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,399
the authentication of this key

806
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,760
is not

807
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,080
performed on per key level

808
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,399
in contrast with encryption so they're

809
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,440
authenticated on ike message level and

810
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080
ike messages are not uh protected

811
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,720
against quantum computer in the first in

812
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,679
the very first iksa before and your key

813
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:42,960
takes place

814
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,159
so we have a situation when a

815
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,600
multicast key

816
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,159
the the attacker an attacker that is

817
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,320
equipped with quantum computer

818
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,679
cannot read

819
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,880
the key but it can read all the other

820
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,640
stuff and it can if it if it can break

821
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,320
um

822
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,679
difficult online so it can manipulate

823
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,720
this key

824
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,679
without knowing them so it can replace

825
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,440
them with garbage and uh

826
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,519
makes everything that authentication

827
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,399
will succeed for the growth member so

828
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,799
it's it's still not a good

829
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,519
uh from security point of view

830
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,919
so but it's better that

831
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,320
attacker can not raise them

832
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,080
but

833
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,880
it's worse that it can manipulate them

834
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,399
so

835
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,880
is it still an important threat

836
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,279
to justify development of draft

837
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,360
ip second view equi2

838
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,039
alternative

839
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,000
query alt that describes an alternative

840
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,399
way of using bpk

841
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,120
so

842
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,279
i don't have strict opinion

843
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,679
right now so

844
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,640
yeah

845
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,000
so

846
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,640
i think if it's important for the

847
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,919
application

848
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,000
to protect against that there's a very

849
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
simple solution then they can do the

850
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,640
reiki

851
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,480
of the iksa immediately when they create

852
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,000
it and that will protect it against

853
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,520
these attacks also

854
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,918
so because we already have a simple

855
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,040
standard standardized way of solving

856
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,719
decision i don't think we actually need

857
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,480
to do anything specific here except to

858
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,199
say that if you care about the

859
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,040
group policy and discuss this kind of

860
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,000
attacks

861
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,839
ludoriki has described it i think

862
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,839
actually we all already heard text in in

863
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,119
our you know

864
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,639
uh uh

865
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,480
ppk trust saying that you should you

866
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,280
should do this if you care about it

867
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,320
uh well okay it is possible just want to

868
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,599
remind you that

869
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,719
the way

870
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,079
it it is not as easy to make

871
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,000
existing protocol level

872
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
uh

873
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,520
because

874
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,239
every key must be done by group members

875
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,800
so it is defined as a draft we define a

876
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,240
new notification sony key is needed and

877
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,040
then group member performs like say

878
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,640
re-key and i

879
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,400
jso registration so

880
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,119
instead of two

881
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,560
two message exchanges we should

882
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,280
have about four or five exchanges just

883
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,079
to get a registration so if it is

884
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,400
if it is not a big cost then we can

885
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,320
follow this way

886
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,079
it just will complicate a bit

887
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,079
registration procedure

888
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,320
so scott

889
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,079
back to er to esn uh

890
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,000
i think in my opinion it should be a

891
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,920
must not because of the complexity

892
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,800
however if you do allow it you need to

893
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,200
actually outline how it works how does a

894
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,920
group member who who does learn the high

895
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,599
order bits

896
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,359
if if it doesn't you're it's a uh

897
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,960
different implementers will do different

898
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
things and it will not interoperate

899
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,800
we've done that before it's a it's ugly

900
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,800
and rfc uh

901
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,480
3302303 defines an algorithm for

902
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,040
guessing this coyote beats or who is

903
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,280
just a

904
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,800
guess

905
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,560
procedure in a loop

906
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,480
so it's very time and efficient so you

907
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,839
try some

908
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,280
candidates but actually if if your high

909
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,119
or the beat differs

910
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,079
dramatically from the current it will

911
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,760
vary resource consuming so if it is just

912
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,359
one two or three

913
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,880
uh

914
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
uh

915
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,119
i don't know plus one plus two plus

916
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,000
three

917
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,880
it's not

918
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,599
time consuming but if it is

919
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,520
very different it is very time consuming

920
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,119
yeah if we're talking about a group

921
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,040
member who can potentially join after

922
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,640
the stream has gone on for quite a while

923
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,839
we the difference could be quite

924
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,640
large yes yes that's my concern that's

925
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,799
why i said should not or must not

926
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,359
but if i understand correctly one try is

927
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,280
just doing you know

928
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,079
try esn with high order with zero

929
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,720
check the what check the pocket

930
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
yes one

931
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,480
and each try

932
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,560
is uh

933
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,599
uh sorry four gigabytes of data or sorry

934
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,480
four

935
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,320
billion packets

936
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,480
in that stream which is going to be like

937
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,760
you know

938
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,720
uh i would say four terabytes

939
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,400
about each of those

940
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,760
so if you need to do you know 10

941
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,040
uh checks for one bucket for every uh

942
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,200
you know 40 terabytes of data that

943
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,599
should be true that i don't think it's

944
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,119
actually going to be that resource

945
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,480
control

946
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,079
resource

947
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,680
expensive in that sense i mean

948
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,280
uh except that what if the package you

949
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,800
tried your test your testing on just

950
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,400
happens to do to not be a valid packet

951
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,839
then when do you stop

952
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,960
and

953
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,560
when do you start and when do you stop

954
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,920
that's a good question i think we

955
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,160
probably need some kind of you know

956
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,680
instructions or perhaps trying a couple

957
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,880
of pockets not the first one you'll see

958
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,200
with unicast to say it is a bit easier

959
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,960
because usually

960
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,119
you have uh

961
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,079
some candidate

962
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,680
uh higher 30 bits

963
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,160
that was that you used before

964
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,400
but somehow you skip

965
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,440
a lot of

966
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,760
packets and you want to resync

967
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,320
you know what to start with

968
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,000
because you have a previous version but

969
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,440
previous value

970
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,960
for this extended

971
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,880
high audience standard uh

972
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,640
esm and uh with uh

973
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,960
grow per se it is not the case

974
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,839
and probably if you start from zero and

975
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,000
run to

976
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,720
two

977
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,079
in

978
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,800
32 power it's very self-consuming

979
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,760
so

980
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,079
what really to start from

981
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,320
and when to stop that's

982
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,800
the question so you have

983
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,280
um yeah i think uh unicast essays are

984
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,440
very different in that we expect the two

985
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,359
sides to be synchronized

986
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,520
if you missed four billion

987
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,960
packets something is really wrong

988
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,839
whereas

989
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,560
with uh group essays

990
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,280
it's perfectly valid for some

991
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,560
entity to to join in the middle so

992
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,000
we may have wrapped the 4 billion

993
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,680
32-bit counter

994
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,480
several times since then and so i think

995
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,720
it's either going to it has to be either

996
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,079
must not or else uh a mechanism where

997
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,720
you uh send occasion

998
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,960
when they join you to send them the

999
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,920
um

1000
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,839
where you are with the uh counter

1001
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,839
yeah disclaimer

1002
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,760
i i agree on that and i think actually

1003
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,160
we could we could i mean it's not

1004
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,040
unreasonable to allow you know the

1005
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,440
group members who already has the key

1006
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,079
and know the highest es and bits

1007
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,880
to actually notify

1008
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,240
the you know

1009
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,280
the key manager uh every

1010
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,440
4 billion packets that oh my esn

1011
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,800
actually increment got incremented by

1012
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,240
one now so we could have some kind of

1013
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,520
mechanism where they could actually send

1014
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,960
a notify to the you know

1015
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,280
what what is the name of the key manager

1016
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,119
remember

1017
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,040
but sending notified they are saying oh

1018
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,440
they did this essays esn is now this

1019
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,960
uh they could send that every now and

1020
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,880
then you know every billion packets or

1021
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,400
something like that

1022
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,200
and then you know when the when the new

1023
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
device joined

1024
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,119
he could get that information along with

1025
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,680
the key to say that last time last time

1026
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,160
i heard the es and high order bits was

1027
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,680
77.

1028
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,119
so start your search from there

1029
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,640
so so that actually would solve the

1030
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,000
problem that we actually don't have to

1031
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,160
go too far in the future because i mean

1032
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,240
if it updates every bill on pockets they

1033
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
shouldn't be missing

1034
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,000
that many four billions of pockets so

1035
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,839
you're going three or four in forward is

1036
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,920
enough and then you can stop and if you

1037
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,160
can't find it that then you might

1038
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
actually go back to the you know your

1039
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,720
your group controller and say that i

1040
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,240
this key isn't working do something

1041
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,400
or request the key again and get the new

1042
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,560
esn value perhaps

1043
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,599
well but you forget the situation when

1044
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,359
jesse case is not

1045
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,079
a member of the group of the data sector

1046
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,640
but he but he hasn't but but

1047
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,640
the group members are part of the same

1048
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,560
they can send the notifies

1049
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,240
over the i channel

1050
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,400
to the uh to the he doesn't need to be

1051
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,800
in the key environment key server

1052
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,160
doesn't have to be the member of the

1053
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,960
group

1054
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,240
he just needs to be getting the

1055
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,119
information from other group members

1056
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,599
so whoever is sending lots of data to

1057
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,480
the group

1058
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,040
the group could send updates every you

1059
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,960
know every now and then

1060
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,440
you don't want to have everybody sending

1061
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,000
the updates but you want to have some

1062
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,520
somebody sending updates every now and

1063
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,240
then it could be so that actually

1064
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,000
people send it after you know a certain

1065
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,400
amount of after after they have sent

1066
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,200
certain amount of pockets

1067
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
yeah but

1068
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,760
well it came to me just suddenly that

1069
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,480
well actually sequence number are

1070
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,040
not very useful for multicast if we have

1071
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,119
several centers

1072
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,960
so

1073
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,240
so it's probably not an issue uh esn i

1074
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,800
mean because uh where if you will use

1075
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,440
sequence number two was extended or not

1076
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,560
extended

1077
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,720
if we have uh

1078
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,200
several ascendants in the group

1079
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,000
they are not useful because each will

1080
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
implement their sequence numbering

1081
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,319
independently and

1082
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,880
now airplay protection will be

1083
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,480
will be

1084
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,440
will be possible

1085
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,760
yeah so so they actually are only useful

1086
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,800
if you have a one sender yes that's also

1087
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,400
at that center they could then actually

1088
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,319
update that so we perhaps would have a

1089
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,839
text saying that you shouldn't be using

1090
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,920
esn unless you have a setup where you

1091
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,440
have one sender

1092
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,000
at that sender can update the

1093
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,760
key manager uh

1094
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,079
key server with the latest es and every

1095
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,760
time it wraps around

1096
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,440
and then we have a you know some kind of

1097
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,200
mechanics of sending it to the group

1098
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,680
members when they join

1099
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,400
so i didn't say that if if you are if

1100
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,960
you have multiple centers don't use esn

1101
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,480
and you know

1102
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,119
and you are allowed not to use it

1103
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,480
if you don't like it

1104
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,280
then we can simplify things and instead

1105
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,400
of

1106
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,680
providing group control server with

1107
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,200
a new high order bit of esn

1108
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,640
the only sender can just

1109
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,680
unregister itself from the group just

1110
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,680
making the group disbanded and form a

1111
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,720
new group a new group security essay

1112
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,359
and then we can stick with uh

1113
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,560
32-bit sequence number and just

1114
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,520
change

1115
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,200
they say more frequently

1116
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,680
probably

1117
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,920
so i think it must be brought to the

1118
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,319
list and discussed a bit more

1119
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,119
if you don't mind

1120
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,160
so another question is a tunnel using

1121
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,000
tunnel mode

1122
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,760
so uh well sorry what about

1123
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,760
apk integration so i think we

1124
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,960
we decided that this approach uh

1125
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,570
that is that uh

1126
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,720
[Music]

1127
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,880
group controller

1128
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,480
notifies the group members that it

1129
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,880
should immediately rekey and only then

1130
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,119
under key and registration and only then

1131
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,520
censor key is

1132
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,440
is affordable

1133
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,000
so right

1134
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,280
okay

1135
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,880
so tunnel mode

1136
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,319
so currently gi quit 2

1137
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,200
doesn't provide group members with tonal

1138
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,400
address

1139
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,280
and

1140
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,960
this is a big problem this is a big

1141
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,280
question for me whether it is needed

1142
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,480
at all

1143
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,720
and if we look at rfc 5374

1144
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,800
multicast extension for security

1145
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,319
architecture

1146
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,200
it

1147
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,040
allows both channel and transport mode

1148
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,079
but tunnel mode is described as a

1149
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,839
so-called tunnel mode with address

1150
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,160
preservation when ap addresses from in

1151
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,160
and from the outer

1152
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,079
type of heaters are the same

1153
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,119
so the ipads are just copied

1154
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,400
from

1155
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,359
in a

1156
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,079
ip header to the outer one

1157
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,839
and so it's some kind

1158
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,359
of very

1159
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,480
some kind of tunnel mods that

1160
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,960
with the same addresses that provides i

1161
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,440
think no additional benefits

1162
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,119
but it is still defined

1163
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,920
so in this case we don't need a channel

1164
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,839
address because it is always the same it

1165
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,760
is always this multicast

1166
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,920
address from the inner

1167
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,760
heater but

1168
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,200
so my question uh

1169
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,680
so it seems that this mods had little

1170
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,880
failure it just consumes the resources

1171
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,880
and i think the only reason to use it if

1172
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,040
uh some gateways participation is a

1173
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,400
group and i don't know wrote from one

1174
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,359
multicast address from

1175
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,040
another one or

1176
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,000
encapsulates a unicast into multicast i

1177
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,520
don't know

1178
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,560
but how group control k7 knows if this

1179
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,560
is the case so it is pre-configured or

1180
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,079
not

1181
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,319
and

1182
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,480
the second question

1183
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,480
is rfc 5374 defines that both addresses

1184
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,119
can be preserved but

1185
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,240
a separate bit controls whether they are

1186
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,000
preserved

1187
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,359
either source or destination of both

1188
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,280
and my question

1189
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,200
who will control it

1190
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,559
souls

1191
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,359
gateways that performs this

1192
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,079
tunneling or group controller kisera in

1193
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,920
that sense that growth control kisabi

1194
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,480
doesn't have enough information to

1195
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,319
tell

1196
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,400
so it's it's a question more multicast

1197
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,319
and i don't have enough expertise in

1198
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,640
this area

1199
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,800
any opinion

1200
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,760
it doesn't help because it you know if

1201
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,520
the objects are always same it doesn't

1202
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,839
really matter

1203
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,119
yes

1204
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,800
but

1205
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,400
i just try to follow rfc 5674 which

1206
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,000
defines a multicast extension for

1207
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,920
architecture and there are two mods

1208
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,440
defined

1209
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,440
transport mode internal map visible

1210
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,440
address preservation

1211
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,240
so

1212
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
if we

1213
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,680
support it

1214
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,520
then

1215
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,599
i just see no value for this channel

1216
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,559
mode but it is defined

1217
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,119
so my question should we support both of

1218
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,000
them or should we

1219
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,240
see some real use for it

1220
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
i'm probably can we

1221
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,200
request an expertise from i don't know

1222
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
it's uh

1223
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,640
routine area on what would multicast but

1224
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,800
transport area

1225
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,440
can we do it

1226
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,880
some review from

1227
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,040
[Music]

1228
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,520
people who are experienced in this area

1229
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,839
so

1230
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,680
what do you think you have

1231
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,200
as a chairs yes chairs i i would say

1232
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,960
just uh make it much

1233
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,440
as simple as possible so actually just i

1234
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,839
would just say don't just let's use

1235
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,640
transport mode and that's easier i think

1236
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,559
okay whatever is easier for you to

1237
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,119
actually document

1238
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,640
it's for me it's good

1239
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,359
uh yeah i uh

1240
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,559
if i recall if if i recall correctly the

1241
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:41,920
problem with trump uses choosing

1242
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,559
transport mode is that the

1243
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,559
the ip addresses are then not protected

1244
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,319
unless you do age which we're not going

1245
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,240
to

1246
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,000
then say that somebody played them and

1247
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,400
it and did those changes

1248
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,640
would not be detected

1249
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,920
yes that's a good point

1250
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,640
very good point that i think we should

1251
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,559
document that and then perhaps actually

1252
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,480
keep it there because it would actually

1253
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,400
be useful to know who the sender is

1254
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,079
if all of the senders has the same you

1255
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,119
know

1256
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,400
keys it doesn't matter because it

1257
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,000
doesn't authenticate the sender anyway

1258
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,359
but

1259
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,000
but at least you know who who would be

1260
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,839
could blame if there's some carpets

1261
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,240
coming in

1262
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,920
louie

1263
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,599
yeah i was actually going to make a

1264
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,800
similar comment to the previous

1265
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,160
speaker

1266
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,920
i also don't mind taking a look at it

1267
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,640
and then echo the comment and chat about

1268
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,040
there is a working group on multicast

1269
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,480
but you know i have a little experience

1270
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,079
multicast i don't mind looking at it but

1271
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,000
i do think if you're

1272
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,599
not supporting something that's in a

1273
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,760
base rfc you really should do abyss on

1274
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,440
that rfc saying you're not support you

1275
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,920
know that mode really isn't supported

1276
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,880
um

1277
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,640
you know i don't think you can

1278
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,240
just ignore a mode um

1279
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,000
that's in the base rfc

1280
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,960
okay

1281
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,839
so just keep keep support for both

1282
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,240
transport and tunnel with address

1283
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,079
preservation only with address

1284
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,000
preservation

1285
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,200
as defined in 5374.

1286
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,680
okay

1287
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,440
next one

1288
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,640
so the next

1289
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,520
question is udp encapsulation so do we

1290
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,760
need an edp encapsulation for multicast

1291
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,160
data security essay

1292
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,118
and if we need to then how to signal it

1293
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,040
isaac explicitly

1294
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,800
for example let the dedicated a new

1295
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,480
transform type or implicitly by

1296
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,440
specifying the destination port

1297
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,839
for 500

1298
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,079
so i i don't know

1299
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,880
it's again it's my my like a lack of my

1300
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,119
expertise in multicast

1301
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,880
i don't know how

1302
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,319
how often net

1303
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,960
nets are present and do we really need

1304
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,160
utp encapsulation because my my i

1305
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,520
suspect that

1306
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,040
not are really really rare in multicast

1307
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,319
but it's only my perception

1308
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,759
so any opinion on this

1309
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,880
yeah i was actually more or less

1310
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,480
thinking about it's not

1311
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,400
i don't think we actually need uh if if

1312
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,160
there's a nuts in the middle i think the

1313
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,000
multicast probably don't work with them

1314
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,640
anyway but but the udp encapsulation

1315
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,079
might actually be useful in the other

1316
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,839
cases because i have seen also networks

1317
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,839
that doesn't allow you the port 50 co

1318
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,760
protocol 50 go through

1319
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,359
but mike dalla you know even the

1320
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,720
multicast with udp go through

1321
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,400
they don't do not but they don't they

1322
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,720
just filter you know things that they

1323
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,880
don't understand the right basic is that

1324
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,400
oh it seems to be complicated i don't

1325
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,640
understand i block it

1326
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,400
so it might be actually

1327
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,920
in some cases might be useful but of

1328
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,440
course one of the problem there is that

1329
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,280
because if we are sending a data in

1330
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,960
multicast that we have to send it to

1331
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,559
everybody in the same format meaning

1332
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,240
that we are sending either import

1333
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,160
protocol 50 or

1334
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,880
in in a udp port five 4500

1335
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,800
it's not really a per

1336
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,119
device you know thing that you can

1337
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,800
actually configure it it should be her

1338
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,839
essay

1339
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,000
yes and and then i think we need to

1340
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,400
actually have a sp use transfer type or

1341
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,760
something like that

1342
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,760
and as the multicast

1343
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,920
as currently defined in i question one

1344
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,680
doesn't support that i don't think we

1345
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,599
actually need to add that feature now

1346
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:44,960
because

1347
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,319
we are not

1348
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,400
qualified to be experts or this is

1349
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,839
better to actually understand the

1350
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,520
implications of it

1351
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,200
so i think it's better to just say that

1352
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,880
okay

1353
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,200
let's not add it now but if we but know

1354
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,359
that if if somebody comes back and say

1355
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,720
oh we would actually really like that

1356
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,040
then we can say oh yes okay we can add

1357
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,720
make an extension for that later

1358
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,839
so just drop it now and

1359
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,480
if somebody needed then my

1360
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,839
issue an extension document okay i agree

1361
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,280
thank you

1362
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,599
and uh okay

1363
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,920
transport more signaling

1364
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,960
again it was uh

1365
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,280
in terrorist review concurrently in the

1366
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,000
draft uh to signal uh transport mode

1367
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,800
well if uh the problem so group security

1368
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,040
association may have some ipsec say

1369
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,440
created in internal mode and sum in

1370
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,359
transfer part it's currently

1371
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,920
and how to indicate which say

1372
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,960
uh from this set of assays is created in

1373
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,079
which mode

1374
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,000
so currently the draft change the

1375
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,319
semantics of use transmit mode when it

1376
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,960
is used in the context of gip2

1377
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,880
so that uh in iq2 this notification

1378
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,480
doesn't use doesn't have uh spi and

1379
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,000
protocol field

1380
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,960
doesn't use them it has it doesn't use

1381
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,359
and

1382
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,319
now we are defining jquery 2 will define

1383
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,079
it so the protocol in this pair fields

1384
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,280
are used

1385
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,319
to indicate which say use transport mode

1386
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:19,440
and another different sensors is that

1387
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,040
multiple instances

1388
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,799
multiple instances

1389
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,280
of this notification can be sent

1390
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,079
uh

1391
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,240
so each instance indicates that this

1392
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,040
particular essay identified with spi is

1393
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,280
created with transport mode so i think

1394
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,240
that it is it is not an update or

1395
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:42,000
fc7296 because the context is clear

1396
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,480
and the context

1397
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,960
just determines which interpretation is

1398
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,799
correct and for unicast i could say

1399
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:54,000
we use current interpretation for jquery

1400
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,520
2

1401
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,000
we use as a new interpretation but terra

1402
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,839
said that it is not ok so we have

1403
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:04,000
several options

1404
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,400
several other options so either add the

1405
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,240
new notification

1406
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,599
for example

1407
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,599
gsa use transport mode

1408
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,319
that will have the semantic described

1409
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,119
above but just a different identify the

1410
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,559
message there

1411
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,520
uh or add a new transform

1412
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,720
for example it can be called

1413
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,359
encapsulation mode in gsa preload so

1414
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,720
that we can

1415
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,240
indicate which mode says created per in

1416
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,000
a per se basis

1417
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,119
or prohibit policy when someone say

1418
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,040
created in transport mode and some

1419
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,119
created internal mode so in this case

1420
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,240
all the data security say in this group

1421
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,240
security essay will be either created in

1422
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,319
transport mode or roll will be created

1423
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,480
internal mode and so we can reduce use

1424
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,359
transport modification disease

1425
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,420
so any opinion

1426
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,920
[Music]

1427
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,480
what should we do

1428
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,280
as we don't really know

1429
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,720
whether these people are going to be

1430
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,559
using transport motor tunnel mode and so

1431
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,040
on and we have a mechanism saying that

1432
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,280
use two different csa payloads meaning

1433
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,839
okay extra payload extra round trip

1434
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,040
because i think you need to do one

1435
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,720
router with first gsa with that you

1436
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,599
start transport and second one with that

1437
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,359
without use transport more so i think

1438
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,000
it's actually simple to say that okay

1439
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,680
you are not allowed to use a mixer

1440
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,839
transport and tunnel mode in same gsa if

1441
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,760
you would if you need that feature

1442
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,400
use two tsa you know exchange is already

1443
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,799
two different uh creates all they say or

1444
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,640
sorry what was the name of the

1445
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,720
oh that would be two different groups

1446
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,960
it will be two different groups yeah so

1447
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,960
to do it in different groups and and uh

1448
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,160
you know

1449
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,160
and if people later come back and say

1450
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,000
that oh we use this feature very

1451
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,559
frequently and we want to use this and

1452
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,559
we don't want to pay the extra penalty

1453
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,319
of doing that so

1454
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,520
then we're going to come back and make a

1455
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,920
modification i want to pick i i think we

1456
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,440
should get this out as simple as

1457
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,200
possible out

1458
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,880
now and not

1459
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,680
you know try to

1460
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,000
think what people might be thinking or

1461
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,559
requiring in the future

1462
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,799
we should think about we should have a

1463
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,960
better of doing in the future in the or

1464
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,799
better of doing things even if it's not

1465
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,520
optimal then we can optimize it later if

1466
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,040
if we found out that this is very

1467
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,200
important that they would do this every

1468
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,359
two seconds

1469
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:30,160
okay

1470
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,359
i got it thank you

1471
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,640
well

1472
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,280
i think it's all unless i forgot uh

1473
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,079
something that can happen because

1474
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,040
again

1475
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,359
the draft is huge and

1476
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,520
general review is

1477
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,599
also not small

1478
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,040
so

1479
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,599
i will issue a new version and i think

1480
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,280
at least one more route and review is

1481
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,880
definitely needed

1482
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,440
again the document is big and it's easy

1483
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,400
to

1484
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,119
to

1485
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,799
leave something very important just

1486
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,079
because it's

1487
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,680
dropped from

1488
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,440
my mind

1489
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,799
and

1490
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,599
i'll be very grateful if people look at

1491
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,920
the document and

1492
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,119
send comments to the list on any of the

1493
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,599
issues that i

1494
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,280
just

1495
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,680
we discussed now i try to have a

1496
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,119
discussion now

1497
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,480
or any other issue or any comment about

1498
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,760
the document so thank you very much and

1499
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,960
uh please review

1500
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,280
yes so i would like to actually

1501
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,119
get people feedback is there anybody

1502
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,599
here actually be willing to review this

1503
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,079
document

1504
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,680
dan

1505
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,799
are you willing to review this document

1506
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,240
you are looking like

1507
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,640
you're in the headlights

1508
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,599
oh you said yes good

1509
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,880
great

1510
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,359
yeah all right so i i really like to get

1511
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:08,960
more reviews on this because it's it's

1512
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,400
it's something that

1513
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,880
has been out there for like uh

1514
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,280
10 years and we should it was get

1515
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,799
dropped because of them cars the working

1516
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,599
group got closed and mcgregor got closed

1517
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:20,960
and and so

1518
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,240
we should try to get it out and

1519
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,799
thank you

1520
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,760
all right

1521
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,839
so

1522
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,200
so next we have then the optional essay

1523
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,520
ds payloads inside xa

1524
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,280
exchange

1525
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,280
okay another

1526
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,839
pass

1527
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,920
you should be able to

1528
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,599
drive the slides now this is the

1529
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,760
combined slide so just go forward

1530
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,760
okay thank you

1531
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,079
um hello everyone and

1532
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:22,799
um

1533
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,760
i'm weipan from huawei and i'm glad to

1534
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,240
present this uh the updates of this

1535
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,599
draft and

1536
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,599
uh this draft has been

1537
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,040
gone through uh maybe three years and

1538
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,160
uh

1539
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,160
i'm very happy to see many people are

1540
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,480
interested in this draft and

1541
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,160
provided

1542
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,920
many useful and comments and suggestions

1543
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,079
and

1544
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,319
um this is the recap of the solution

1545
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,799
currently the solution is quite simple

1546
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:55,920
and

1547
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,799
it contains three steps of

1548
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,280
for the optimization first

1549
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,119
in the negotiation

1550
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,839
the initiator and the responder will

1551
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:09,520
initiate the support for doing this

1552
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,280
optimization after the ikos

1553
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,079
exchange and

1554
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,920
after negotiation

1555
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,960
when working the ik sa

1556
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,559
the initiator will send our new

1557
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,880
optimized key notification which

1558
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,599
contains the new spi to the responder

1559
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,440
and the responder will

1560
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,760
respond reply

1561
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,559
in the same way and in this

1562
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,680
in this situation the current spi is

1563
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,480
included in the ike header

1564
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,000
and

1565
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,599
when during during rekindle child essays

1566
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,559
the initiator also sends the optimized

1567
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,559
rekey

1568
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,359
notification and in this case

1569
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,760
the current spi is included in the

1570
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,799
re-key as a notification

1571
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,119
the updates from

1572
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,480
version 7 to version 8 are mostly

1573
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,960
editorial changes and

1574
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,359
we updated the

1575
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:18,480
diagrams uh which shown showed

1576
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,079
in the previous slide and the

1577
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:21,680
corresponding text

1578
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,200
to clearly show how new and old spis are

1579
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,720
included in the

1580
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,118
child exchange

1581
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,240
um

1582
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,039
we also believe that the current person

1583
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,680
now is clear and mature so

1584
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,400
uh maybe we can ask for working group

1585
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,039
adoption at this time yeah

1586
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:45,839
that's it

1587
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,759
so any comments on this

1588
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,400
follow up it's just just a comment that

1589
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,160
we plan on implementing this in

1590
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,160
librespawn

1591
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,039
i must confess that i

1592
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,599
didn't read the latest version of the

1593
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,640
draft yet but i have a question so you

1594
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,520
are using a notify below to indicate and

1595
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,440
which essay is

1596
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,799
is been rekeyed

1597
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,880
uh with a decision

1598
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,319
ipsec

1599
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,480
so my question is about the format of

1600
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,839
this payload are you using an spi field

1601
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,799
and the protocol field or is this spi

1602
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:51,039
are in the data

1603
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,280
field of this assay

1604
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,640
just

1605
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,200
a question

1606
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,640
uh

1607
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,000
do you mean the new spi uh

1608
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,520
code in which yes yes

1609
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,599
oh i i see paul

1610
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:08,960
or maybe you can

1611
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,280
want to say something i'll speak um

1612
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,359
i i believe the news spi is in a

1613
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,839
notified payload because the notify

1614
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,880
is using the existing spine numbers

1615
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,920
well

1616
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,520
right so to notify

1617
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,760
us the spine numbers of the i can say if

1618
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,039
i'm correct

1619
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,880
so it's in the notified payload if i

1620
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,960
remember this properly

1621
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,280
so so just going to say

1622
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,280
notified below does have an spi values

1623
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,440
but the fbi values are really

1624
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,640
meant to be vicious it's it's not really

1625
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,799
yes usually this kind of organization

1626
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,200
it's like for this essay but here we are

1627
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,640
talking about some other essay that's

1628
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,319
why i think the reiki the

1629
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,280
you know

1630
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,039
ricky sa actually is using into the

1631
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,760
payload because it it's it's not

1632
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,760
it's talking about some other sp and

1633
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,960
like this one

1634
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,400
and i think this one should be also

1635
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,119
using the same it's just a payload and

1636
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,480
it's okay to have it have it in the

1637
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,839
payload because we can this is a new

1638
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:07,359
notifier we can actually add it there

1639
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,599
that's that's that's why that's why i

1640
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,280
asked so it was a essence of my question

1641
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,599
so the spi should be really should be in

1642
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,440
the data

1643
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,599
area of the notificat load and not in

1644
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:20,559
the

1645
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,720
spi field and protocol field

1646
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,640
but i didn't read the draft so probably

1647
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,440
this is already the case so sorry

1648
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,880
i want to be sure thank you

1649
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,119
so and i think this is not expressed

1650
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,720
down in our charter but this is the

1651
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,680
minor extensions on an uh update so i

1652
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,520
think we can actually fit into that says

1653
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,920
uh so i think we can actually get you

1654
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,640
know our id to

1655
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,400
allow us to take care of this of course

1656
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,839
the 80 now changed he might have

1657
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,160
different opinions so i probably need to

1658
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,720
ask but uh

1659
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,119
is there any objections of here in there

1660
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,880
who would actually say that we shouldn't

1661
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,480
be starting the working group last

1662
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,160
working group adoption call for this

1663
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,640
document

1664
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,200
and of course we can continue think

1665
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,280
we're fixing things like notify payloads

1666
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,960
if they're not correct uh after we get

1667
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,119
you know

1668
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,559
uh it has a working group document

1669
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,160
i don't see anything so i will probably

1670
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,720
talk with lady and then start a you know

1671
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,240
adoption call for this after this

1672
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,359
meeting

1673
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:24,880
or probably actually a week after

1674
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,799
because i think the 80s are usually for

1675
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,480
some reason they are busy after the itf

1676
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,440
week i don't know why

1677
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,480
so i think

1678
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,079
so that was everything about this

1679
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,839
so let's see

1680
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:48,799
can i stall back the power controls no

1681
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,799
there's no way for a chair to steal back

1682
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:58,880
the control of the slides

1683
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:10,640
this one so now we are in

1684
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,039
open discussion any other business that

1685
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:16,640
people would not like to talk about here

1686
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,238
we are getting

1687
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,759
quite a lot of our

1688
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,719
documents out from the to the ist

1689
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:24,319
but we still have a couple of documents

1690
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,479
that haven't been seeing that much of

1691
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:27,600
you know

1692
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,799
progress in

1693
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,479
the last few days or or months or years

1694
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,319
in some cases

1695
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,120
paul go ahead

1696
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,960
sorry i couldn't find my window and tap

1697
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,520
and button for the end up on my laptop

1698
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,560
um

1699
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,719
i just want to briefly point out the the

1700
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:48,799
the multi sa document um we still have a

1701
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,520
linux implementation that is not merged

1702
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,679
into the main line because they don't

1703
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,279
want to merge it before we are further

1704
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,359
in the process and i actually dedicated

1705
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:58,319
to it

1706
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,399
so i would like it if people would

1707
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:03,120
review and comment on our proposal

1708
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,960
it was very much simplified in the last

1709
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,040
drive by removing all the

1710
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,120
quality of service items

1711
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,198
so please give us some feedback so we

1712
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,520
can move on and

1713
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,120
get the implementation in mainline

1714
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,599
kernel thanks

1715
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,519
so i assume you send an

1716
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,719
no

1717
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,640
this kind of note to the working group

1718
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,480
list and say that please review this

1719
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,759
all right so i think there was a

1720
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,960
valerian queue or something

1721
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:44,238
well i just wonder whether there is an

1722
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:46,839
interest in now you're very quiet

1723
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,439
again or start talking it might actually

1724
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,399
help power

1725
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,719
can you hear me now yes we can hear no

1726
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:54,000
no okay

1727
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,239
i just wonder if there is any interest

1728
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,600
in beyond 64 car draft that describes

1729
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,560
how to transfer large loads

1730
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,520
well

1731
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,000
probably not in a general way but for

1732
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,400
key exchange and oath per load

1733
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,239
in iq 2

1734
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,800
and also defines so-called mixed

1735
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,440
transport mode when ike is

1736
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,560
around he's been run over tcp use tcp

1737
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:23,360
for its exchanges and esp uh runs

1738
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,400
or udp or over ip

1739
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,360
and i think that there is

1740
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,560
probably one more application for this

1741
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,840
mode

1742
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,000
and i've seen just a few hours ago a new

1743
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,840
draft

1744
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
zero version has been published about

1745
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,719
combined uh hybrid authentication i like

1746
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:46,560
we do

1747
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,080
and

1748
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,800
i didn't read it in detail but as far as

1749
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,120
understand it combines several post

1750
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,280
quantum

1751
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,000
key signature algorithms that all will

1752
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,040
that also will make an iq load very

1753
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:01,920
large

1754
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,719
and probably it's time to look at this

1755
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,600
beyond 64 car draft

1756
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,679
and

1757
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,840
adopt it if there is an interest

1758
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,000
so tara

1759
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,690
should we ask for adoption should we

1760
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:23,760
[Music]

1761
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,360
i don't know

1762
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,600
initiate a discussion

1763
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,360
you should initiate the discussion and

1764
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,040
then if you get you know people

1765
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,960
interested in that then we have to check

1766
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,360
it out that that is actually in our

1767
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,679
charter to actually solve the issues

1768
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,040
related to the

1769
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,159
uh you know uh post quantum thing that

1770
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:43,760
then and one of the things is the you

1771
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,000
know pocket sizes

1772
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,040
so

1773
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,480
you should initiate the discussion and

1774
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,080
try to get people starting working on it

1775
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,040
and literally

1776
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:07,960
thank you

1777
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,880
so anything else

1778
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,960
before we

1779
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,280
finish

1780
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,360
i don't see anything coming up so i

1781
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,199
think then we actually are

1782
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,880
done

1783
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,520
so we were

1784
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,840
yeah

1785
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,320
this is slower than what i expected in

1786
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,920
with allocated first slide but it was

1787
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,120
good because we actually managed to get

1788
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,640
some issue

1789
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,640
great thank you efficient

1790
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,880
okay so hopefully we'll see everybody in

1791
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,800
philadelphia

1792
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,520
maybe even in person

1793
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,320
yeah here's hoping for philly bye

1794
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,320
everybody

1795
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,320
you
