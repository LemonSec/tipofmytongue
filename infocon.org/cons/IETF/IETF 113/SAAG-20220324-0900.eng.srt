well it's later in the week but i do

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,400
want to remind everyone that the

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
notewell still absolutely kind of

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
applies and this reminds you of your

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,720
responsibilities in participating in the

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
ietf

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
but really to put a finer point on it i

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
would just like to emphasize to everyone

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
we all have to live the itf code of

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,439
conduct and the idea here is we really

25
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,439
need to make sure that when we interact

26
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,920
with each other we keep we keep things

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
professional we're respectful to our

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,079
colleagues we focus on the technology

29
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,000
and overall we're you know remember

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,759
we're all pushing to make sure that the

31
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,079
internet is uh is a safe place this is

32
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,000
the this is the security area kind of

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
after all and we're working to connect

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
everyone around the world

35
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,680
agenda-wise we have a few administrative

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
things as always to get a summary of

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,840
what's happening in the area in the in

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,240
the working group reports continuing our

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,199
tradition of deep diving into technology

40
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,560
we've been developing for quite some

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,000
time in the area to make sure everyone

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
understands it given its pervasive

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,959
deployment paul graciously has agreed to

44
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,920
give an intro to ip ipsec and then we

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,760
have quite a lot of time to talk about

46
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,160
other business if folks want to come to

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000

chairs or someone from those working

127

words by all means kind of do that we'll

129
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
also jump to

130
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,800
the working groups that are not meeting

131
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,039
if anyone wants to make a comment about

132
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,400
those

133
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,479
and then lastly we'll just call anyone

134
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,160
else that wants to comment on what's

135
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,720
happening in related non-sec area

136
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,680
working groups or outside the uh outside

137
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
the security area but relevant to

138
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,560
relevant to sec so pausing here for

139
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,720
for commentary

140
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,680
hi uh justin richer

141
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
the http working group has made

142
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
significant progress on both http

143
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,680
signatures and http digests in recent

144
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,720
months

145
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,880
and i would encourage people in the sec

146
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,639
area to go take a look at both of those

147
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,160
two specs

148
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
they are things that kind of bridge the

149
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,400
apps and sec areas so even though they

150
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,880
are hosted in http it's going to be

151
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
adventurous to a lot of folks here too

152
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,639
and we'd appreciate the eyes thank you

153
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,680
thanks justin and this is barry lieber

154
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,000
talking about dmarc

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
we did not meet here uh we're we're

156
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,720
gonna have an interim at some point soon

157
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,000
uh we we're working on the uh proposed

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
standard version of the former

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,560
experimental spec and uh

160
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,319
are um

161
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,240
currently debating

162
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,319
the what the text is to get rid of the

163
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,479
public suffix list usage and use a tree

164
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
walk instead and that's causing a bit of

165
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,319
controversy in the working group but

166
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,120
it's uh it's resolving so that's where

167
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,360
we are

168
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,840
thanks barry

169
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,599
hey uh tim capalli microsoft and w3c

170
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,280
just something to be aware of there is

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
an effort going on

172
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,280
to

173
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,240
redefine how authentication works in the

174
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,360
browser

175
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
essentially bringing the browser into a

176
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
more active role in things like oauth

177
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,800
and openid connect

178
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
it's a significant shift obviously

179
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,639
so it's just something to be aware of

180
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,160
there is a community group that i'm a

181
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,919
co-chair of called the federated id

182
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,360
community group

183
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
where one of the proposals is kind of

184
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,840
sitting because it doesn't have a home

185
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
and that is open to anyone

186
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,000
to join because it's a community group

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
so if you're interested

188
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,759
it's a very contentious topic as you

189
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,479
might imagine so

190
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,800
thank you

191
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,400
all right i'm not seeing anyone in the

192
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
virtual queue

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,240
my eyes might not be sharp enough to see

194
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,639
the video paul are we clear on the back

195
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,199
mic there

196
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,399
in person

197
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,519
okay yes i think so

198
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,919
uh all right thank you uh so the other

199
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,440
thing i would add to

200
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,919
none to things happening outside the itf

201
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,200
we've mentioned in a couple of working

202
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,839
groups we had a talk on it uh at a

203
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,040
previous itf the nist round three pqc

204
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,440
decision is should be coming real soon

205
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
now uh real soon now so we i think we

206
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,519
are all impatiently waiting for the

207
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,360
results and uh that that'll probably

208
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,680
trigger quite a lot of work inside the

209
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,080
the itf

210
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,360
okay moving along uh so that was the

211
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,040
that was the the commentary on the

212
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
working groups agenda-wise we are now

213
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,000
seamlessly moving into the a.d portion

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,880
of this and um we have a lot of material

215
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,600
here the the motivation is that over the

216
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,440
course of over the course of time from

217
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
the last meeting the ads get all sorts

218
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,560
of questions about what's happening in

219
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,320
the sec area we're just trying to be as

220
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,720
transparent as possible so we summarized

221
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,399
all the different inbound requests that

222
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,640
we that we get on a i don't want to say

223
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,000
on a regular basis but things we

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
commonly get between meetings and want

225
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
to put it out here

226
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
put it out here to the community paul

227
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
and ben uh then please kind of jump in

228
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,600
here kind of heckle me or kind of make

229
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,160
uh additional commentary as we as we get

230
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
through all of this

231
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
all right so uh there's uh in addition

232
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,959
all the different working group

233
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,640
documents we of course are sponsoring

234
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,560
different uh we are also personally

235
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
sponsoring kind of a few documents uh we

236
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,399
we published the ers kind of update as

237
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,800
rfc 9169 and then we we have

238
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,279
security.txt and the updated uh code

239
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,279
points for xml sec in the rfc edq active

240
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,800
still is is the is the numeric id sec

241
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,160
considerations and from sec dispatch we

242
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,399
identified that we're now sponsoring uh

243
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,519
those registry changes for our ssh we

244
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,959
have not you know paul and i have not

245
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,240
yet talked about who's going to grab

246
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
that one since that just came out on

247
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
tuesday

248
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
ben or paul do you want to have any any

249
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,920
last words on

250
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,000
uh i guess on the numeric considerations

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,519
draft since that's the one that's still

252
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,920
in flight

253
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,279
so i i don't yet um i just inherited

254
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,440
this document obviously from ben so uh

255
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
maybe ben has some comments you want to

256
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,600
make

257
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,720
uh yeah uh audio is live now so for that

258
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
one i believe though the waiting for

259
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,800
write-up state means that it finished

260
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,560
the itf last call

261
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,079
but uh

262
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:02,880
the

263
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,480
comments maybe haven't been addressed

264
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
and so the write-up of the waiting for

265
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,120
write-up is the isg ballot

266
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,320
and

267
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,279
i

268
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,120
believe that this one

269
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
there was some controversy about whether

270
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,200
or not changes were made or needed to

271
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,560
the document

272
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
uh and i was

273
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,720
of the opinion that some changes were

274
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,040
needed but it was

275
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,519
not easy to precisely characterize what

276
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,240
those changes were and so it's been sort

277
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,079
of in a holding pattern

278
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,040
while the author and i

279
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,399
tried to get some agreement about what

280
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
the changes that actually were needed

281
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,079
were

282
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,680
and so i

283
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,079
don't know if there's a clear plan for

284
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,320
getting that to happen but i may have

285
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
some more cycles to think about it now

286
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,120
that i'm not

287
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,959
in the day-to-day grind of reading a

288
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,399
bunch of documents every week

289
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
wow you make the job sound so appealing

290
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,680
then

291
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,800
uh and by the way uh technically you

292
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,639
continue to stay a d until the end of

293
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
sag so if you'd like you'd be happy to

294
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
keep the video kind of on with us

295
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,360
because you have as much commentary on

296
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
all this material as as the rest of us

297
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,040
do

298
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,120
uh okay uh so moving along

299
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,760
this is just a list of urls we wanted to

300
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
just continually continue to kind of

301
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,000
remind everyone uh in the in the course

302
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,480
of uh of that that grind to review the

303
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,000
documents because that is certainly how

304
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
it feels sometimes in preparation for

305
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,839
the telechat uh historically ben and i

306
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,440
and paul will be adding kind of a zone

307
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
we thought we find things honestly we

308
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,279
see a lot we wish we did not see a lot

309
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,040
and we just want to make sure kind of in

310
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,800
advance folk folks understand what are

311
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,320
common things that we will drop

312
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,880
discusses on so if you have questions

313
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,160
your colleagues are asking what should i

314
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
do to make sure the security review goes

315
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,200
okay or

316
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,560
frankly you're pushing a document

317
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,040
forward is how do i make sure that

318
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,560
that things aren't discussed on please

319
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,160
do consult that list and share that with

320
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,360
your colleagues

321
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,240
we also we often always get questions of

322
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,279
well i see what's happening in the

323
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,800
working group but you know what are the

324
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,440
80s doing if you want a real-time view

325
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
into what our queue is and what

326
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,200
everything kind of the disposition of

327
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
all those things you can directly click

328
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,120
those urls and get insight into all of

329
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,079
that

330
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,800
ben and i also use the history field of

331
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,120
the data tracker uh

332
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,639
and so if you know you can look at the

333
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,160
states the states kind of describe where

334
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,519
we are in the process but if you want

335
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,600
additional information for example what

336
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
does it mean to say revised id needed

337
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,079
like what do i revise for very often

338
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,920
you'll find those details in that in

339
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,440
that history field

340
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
and then lastly we're trying to keep

341
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,120
that wiki page

342
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
about the security area up to date

343
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,639
especially to help guide new work

344
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,040
inbounding into the ietf and to

345
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
acknowledge when it's been caught but

346
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,440
perhaps not in a working group yet so if

347
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,199
folks from the outside are are looking

348
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,720
we can provide them a summary of what's

349
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,399
happening so that's a link if you get

350
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,240
questions for your colleagues uh about

351
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,680
what's going on there you yourself kind

352
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,880
of want to know

353
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
what what have the ads caught you can

354
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,240
find you can find a pointer there

355
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,199
uh so working group changes since the

356
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,560
last time we got together uh we in the

357
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,839
we uh we in the itf had our in an

358
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,600
interim buff something that we don't do

359
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,399
very often on the topic of of sharing

360
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,120
credentials which was called secret it

361
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,680
was sponsored out of the art area for

362
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,360
folks that attended it there was some

363
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
back and forth about where would this

364
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,519
will ultimately be housed the decision

365
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,360
was this will this is going to be one of

366
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,120
those just like skim which is it's going

367
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
to stay in art but overseen by a sec a d

368
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,720
probably me uh so in terms of kind of

369
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,560
tracking sec area works this is in that

370
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,360
post post buff phase where it looks like

371
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
there's a lot of interest in a working

372
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,920
group we have a charter but the

373
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,079
mechanics of that have not started

374
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,600
uh we uh

375
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,800
we we spun up the ppm ppm working group

376
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,120
out of the priv buff that happened last

377
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,279
time in iatf 112 they're meeting

378
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,880
tomorrow

379
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
colonel closed

380
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,760
and in active recharting right now is

381
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
rats

382
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000
i'll kind of pause here

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,360
better paul do you want to comment on

384
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,920
any of those mechanics

385
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,000
okay

386
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,680
uh so the one thing i'd just like to say

387
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,839
about kind of ppm i mean this really is

388
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,600
a recurring kind of pointer it is

389
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,199
possible to spin up a working group

390
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,040
between you know in one meeting cycle

391
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
where you do a buff and

392
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,720
and you can have a working group before

393
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
the next thing starts if there's a lot

394
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,959
of different prep work so kudos to the

395
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,120
to the ppm kind of proponents to having

396
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
a lot of things kind of teed up in

397
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,360
advance and for having a great community

398
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
discussion to get us here

399
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
wanted to acknowledge uh acknowledge

400
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
some of the changes we've we've had

401
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
amongst our working group kind of chairs

402
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,759
so in dance of course paul is up in

403
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,440
front of the room so he could not

404
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,199
continue on as working group chair

405
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,120
congratulations and thank you to joey

406
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,000

in ppm ben and sam thanks for getting us

410
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,639
getting us kind of spun up and getting

411
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,839
the work started and in skim

412
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,240
aaron thank you for kind of stepping in

413
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
to round out our team uh it was just

414
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,720
nancy there alone and editorially we

415
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
also kind of forgot uh mike uh mike

416
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,279
jones thank you for kind of joining the

417
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,839
kosai team

418
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,519
overall we put out calls i think every

419
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,800
time between

420
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,399
between meeting cycles certainly at

421
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,160
least kind of twice a year if you have

422
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,000
interest in becoming a working group

423
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
chair by all means gotta please send us

424
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
an email we do keep a running list as

425
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920
there are opportunities we do consult

426
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
that list uh between kind of interest

427
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,839
skill set and what we think that working

428
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,120
group needs

429
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
uh and i'll also just have again kind of

430
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
a shout out thank you joey and aaron you

431
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,560
guys are new time chairs we really

432
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,519
appreciate you stepping into this role

433
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,240
for the first time

434
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,959
uh we've gotten a couple kind of

435
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,639
questions on this one uh with any ad

436
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,400
turnover there's a reshuffling of

437
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
working groups we want to make sure that

438
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
you know the skill sets of the aeds are

439
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,240
right the needs of the working groups

440
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
are are kind of satisfied and there's

441
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,439
there's appropriate kind of load

442
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,079
balancing so this is the split between

443
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,919
paul and me uh what you see in red is

444
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,000
where it wasn't a straight swap so we

445
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,839
started from paul taking all of ben's

446
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,760
working groups i kept the working groups

447
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,679
i had and then you know we did a little

448
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,320
uh little exchange primarily i'm taking

449
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
uh ip second me and open pgp because

450
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,360
that's an area where paul is active uh

451
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
paul had also been doing a bunch of work

452
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,400
in dance and he got ebu honestly just

453
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,280
for for a little load balancing

454
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,919
we are not super great about sharing new

455
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,840
working group lists that we create so

456
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,360
we're going to be better about that so

457
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,200
just wanted to call out that a couple

458
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,760
weeks ago we made skit which is which is

459
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,720
uh

460
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,559
which is mainly focused on supply chain

461
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,240
integrity issues you can get more

462
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,000
details about that

463
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,520
from the proceedings we just talked

464
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
about that at the dispatch session on

465
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,160
tuesday

466
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,480
the kind of the new the new item we want

467
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,039
to talk a bit more about is we need

468
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,000
community help on errata processing if

469
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,840
you go to the errata site you'll see

470
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,520
that there's about 250 reported errata

471
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,960
for sec work so reported is a precise

472
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,440
label which means that someone has filed

473
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,039
that errata and nothing has been done

474
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,679
with it so these are unadjudicated uh

475
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,160
errata in the in the sec area uh you

476
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
know if you crunch the numbers a little

477
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,960
bit about 60 of those are actually from

478
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,120
open working groups so the other 40

479
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,799
obviously is from work that no longer

480
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,080
kind of has a home so it's a little

481
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,240
harder to deal with so what we would do

482
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,320
is we'd ask the those participating in

483
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
those working groups and specifically

484
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,080
those chairs to help us out a little bit

485
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,039
and adjudicate those uh

486
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,120
those those uh those 153 reports

487
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,559
folks take the time from the community

488
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,000
to let us know where we may have gotten

489
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,440
it a little bit wrong

490
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,960
and let's make sure we figure out

491
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
whether that's right and maybe with

492
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,559
document updates we can get those fixed

493
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,840
in line or uh or with the new

494
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,880
uh errata overlay tool the those changes

495
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,679
will actually appear

496
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,520
all right uh so so the we have a couple

497
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,440
thank yous that we want to have so first

498
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,520
this is uh this is a different kind of

499
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,039
hybrid meeting we've previously had

500
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,400
meetings where there are remote kind of

501
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,480
participants but they are not uh they

502
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,880
are not an overwhelming majority the the

503
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,039
demographics uh were that almost

504
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,280
two-thirds of sec was removed and only

505
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,679
one-third was on site and this created a

506
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,520
very odd situation where potentially

507
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
there are all sorts of folks in the room

508
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,679
but all the chairs are remote uh this

509
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,600
was this was kind of a new thing for us

510
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,280
so we really wanted to make sure that we

511
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,240
had we had backups so a big thank you to

512
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,480
the different sec working group working

513
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,080
group chairs that pulled double duty in

514
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
addition to having their own kind of

515
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,360
working groups these chairs kind of

516
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,039
stepped in to be an extra set of hands

517
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,960
for those chairs that and those working

518
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,320
groups that were going to be all remote

519
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,240
so thank you thank you for being our

520
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
backup thank you for kind of pushing the

521
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
buttons and really making sure that we

522
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,919
had a seamless kind of experience as we

523
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,679
roll into probably having a lot more

524
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,760
folks on site in these exciting uh

525
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,158
in-person meetings

526
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,919
uh another really big thank you is to

527
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,720
our sector reviewers and and tearow for

528
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,760
running the sector for us these uh these

529
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,080
the reviews done in

530
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,240
in the working groups as early review in

531
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,400
absolutely an ietf last call and as we

532
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,039
prep for the telechat are are invaluable

533
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,520
they catch so many issues before the

534
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
documents are kind of published and kind

535
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,080
of as an ad ben and i and i'm sure paul

536
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,360
will rely

537
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,960
you know really rely on this to help us

538
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,280
kind of bootstrap bootstrap our reviews

539
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,440
especially when things may need a lot of

540
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,039
attention before it kind of gets to us

541
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,200
so really thank you for your service

542
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,480
this is a huge help for us

543
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,320
so the last thank you uh i i wanted to

544
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,159
we really wanted to make here is to

545
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,200
thank uh is to thank ben

546
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,080
uh

547
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,640
you know ben has served two terms back

548
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
to back uh so you know kind of for those

549
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,640
that may not be familiar that's four

550
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
years of his life where in addition to

551
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
whatever else he has

552
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,880
he has got going on he is focused on

553
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,840
making the security area work for us

554
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
uh one of the things that i've learned

555
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,600
about the ad role is that you really

556
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
turn it into what you want it to be it's

557
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,159
what you invest in it and ben has been

558
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,640
amazingly generous with his time and

559
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,159
expertise and you know kind of

560
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,880
personally here i probably learned as

561
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,120
much about the protocol innards from the

562
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,640
weekly sinks we have to talk about

563
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
what's happening as i did from actually

564
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
reading the documents so really thank

565
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
you for that ben

566
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,880
if you published a document in the last

567
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,919
four years you probably also know that

568
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,440
ben has redefined or really next leveled

569
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,600
what it means to get a detailed security

570
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,799
review

571
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,880
his diligence has

572
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
you know prevented you know so many

573
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,320
protocols from shipping with issues uh

574
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
you know i i was kind of curious so

575
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,080
what's a lot of protocols you know what

576
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,320
what did ben really catch so i this

577
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
isn't these aren't stats that are easy

578
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,840
to kind of get there's no interface for

579
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,600
that but then i don't know what what you

580
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
think your key was but i got the numbers

581
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,159
pulled so you balloted on 702 documents

582
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,120
uh during the during the review and of

583
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,000
those you dropped 299 discusses

584
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,720
so in recognition of you really saving

585
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,440
the internet that many times we want to

586
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,559
help you decorate

587
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,799
uh so yeah ben's video is back that's

588
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,720
good so i don't know whether folks can

589
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,760
see what's behind ben so for a long time

590
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,679
during covert i was looking at a at a

591
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,080
blank wall and then we had a meeting i'm

592
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,840
like what is that blue box that you have

593
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,080
behind your head so to clarify for folks

594
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,760
that can't see it that's a really nice

595
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,919
blueprint schematic of the millennium

596
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,440
falcon

597
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,919
so saving the internet is

598
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,480
probably equivalent to han and luke

599
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,760
saving the galaxy from the empire so it

600
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,080
really feels like ben han and luke need

601
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,360
equal recognition so uh

602
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,880
as a result of that it seems like it

603
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,640
should be fair place so what we have for

604
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,360
you

605
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,760
is hopefully you can kind of see that is

606
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,120
a metal of yavin to hang next to your

607
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,039
millennium falcon

608
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,640
so they can be kind of side by side so

609
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,600
your wall is a little less blank

610
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,360
and there will be uh

611
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,480
we'll get that kind of it would have

612
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,080
been more dramatic to give you that kind

613
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,840
of in person we could have maybe had a

614
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,120
tall chewbacca kind of with you uh

615
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,080
instead

616
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,679
i'll make sure that that gets shipped to

617
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,840
you there'll be a plaque inside it turns

618
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,520
out you can't get things engraved with

619
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,360
the latest stats from the telechat from

620
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,760
the meeting anytime soon so that's two

621
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,080
days away in shipping is what i'm told

622
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,880
uh

623
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,400
but you know in all seriousness on

get the work started you made sure we

627
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,840
were on the right track and then you

628
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,360
didn't let us ship without frankly

629
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,039
checking our work so really much

630
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,279
appreciated then thank you

631
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,000

that's that's really a great

633
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,240
uh choice of a gift with that metal

634
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,200
there i

635
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,559
you put a lot of thought into it so

636
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,080
it'll be really fun to have on my wall

637
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,679
yeah maybe when you come in person next

638
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,919
time you can wear it for us

639
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,320
yeah yeah

640
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,120
maybe just to say

641
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,640
all right and yeah thanks for pulling

642
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,880
these numbers too that's a

643
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,400
real

644
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,640
eye-opening numbers i'll tell you one

645
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
off from 300. maybe i should have tried

646
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,080
a little harder

647
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,360
i mean i think if you would have known

648
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,240
you you could have hit it

649
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,559
i am sure that if we pulled up the

650
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,240
leaderboard you would be ahead of ahead

651
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,720
of all of us

652
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
thank you again

653
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,039
really no thank you

654
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,360
thank you for your service ben

655
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,159
all right uh so in terms of our schedule

656
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,240
that's uh that's the front matter that

657
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,159
we had administratively prepared so i'm

658
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,880
gonna turn it over to paul and i'm gonna

659
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,320
get your slides up we're gonna talk a

660
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,799
little bit about ipsec

661
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,360
okay um thank you um

662
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,400
i'd be sad

663
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,320
it's always an interesting item a lot of

664
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
security people wonder why is it still

665
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
there others go like this is the best

666
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,960
thing ever so it's this very dividing

667
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,480
topic

668
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,679
um but i'll give an introduction and

669
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,200
not that i think i will change people's

670
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
minds but maybe some of people will know

671
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,120
a little bit better why it's still

672
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,400
around

673
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,919
okay next slide

674
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,240
uh paul i'm sorry to interrupt can i ask

675
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,200
meet echo to zoom in on wherever paul is

676
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,600
speaking because you're got up from

677
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,760
people and i don't see the audience so i

678
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,600
assume you're standing in front of the

679
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,960
pink box i am right on the x literally

680
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,039
both of my feet are on the x i cannot

681
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,360
position myself more to the left no i

682
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,440
think the camera's not on you

683
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,480
so

684
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,080
that's fine we can i guess continue but

685
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,360
if meat echo can fix that that'd

686
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,120
probably be something okay thanks oh

687
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,200
there we are

688
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,679
okay so um

689
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,559
as as yo i've made clear uh on a message

690
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,039
to the cyclist uh or sorry to the ep

691
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,559
list yesterday

692
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,200
um we even uh spent a lot of time on how

693
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,919
to write the acronym ipsec and this is

694
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,400
from rfc 4303 that clearly states that

695
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
ipsec should be written with a capital i

696
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,679
capital p

697
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,520
and no capital s so thank you joha for

698
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,279
heckling me

699
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,880
as the first person a day before the

700
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,039
meeting

701
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,520
note that all the uh all the rfc numbers

702
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,640
and drafts that are listed in this

703
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,120
presentation they are clickable um for

704
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,880
some reason they don't always show up in

705
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,679
blue because of technology

706
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
but they you can click on them so next

707
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,000
slide

708
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,360
some people might remember rfc6071 it

709
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,320
was a nice overview of all the rfcs

710
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,360
related to to ipsec and ike

711
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
unfortunately it's really outdated even

712
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,799
though um

713
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,880
it still provides a nice overview and 63

714
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,320
pages of references

715
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,200
it is a bit bit out of date so it would

716
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,799
maybe be nice to

717
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,159
do a new one for this but it's um

718
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,399
that would be a challenge to do

719
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,840
so next slide

720
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,360
another work uh that's uh actually a

721
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
really good read and i say this

722
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,880
obviously because i'm one of the authors

723
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,640
of it is nist sb 877 ref one got the

724
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,559
ipsec vpns

725
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,120
the document was originally about 20

726
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
years old

727
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,039
we redid it about

728
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,200
two years ago

729
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,000
um some of the ietfers in the room have

730
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,600
contributed to this document or our

731
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
authors of the document

732
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,039
it goes to a little bit more detail

733
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,919
so i'm going to just briefly take off my

734
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,600
mask because it's hard to keep talking

735
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,279
and breathing through it

736
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,039
um

737
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,200
it includes various deployments and

738
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,360
other useful information configurations

739
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,960
uh for various um known implementations

740
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,880
um it also has a lot of configurations

741
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
for um

742
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
and and the the sorry the nist and fips

743
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,080
recommendations so if you want to

744
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,960
immediately be be fip certified um you

745
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,159
can read through it and we'll give you

746
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,399
all the guidance there as well um

747
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,960
as i say it's a it's a steal at only 149

748
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
pages i hope you have as much fun

749
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,640
reading it as my laptop had swapping

750
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,799
microsoft word and going through all the

751
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,039
revisions over the course of about a

752
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,480
year

753
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,039
so next slide

754
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:12,960
so

755
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,640
the problem with ipsec is that it's

756
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,559
actually a really really powerful tool

757
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,559
and you can do everything with it and as

758
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,440
with swiss army knives anyone who owns

759
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,000
one has cut themselves with it

760
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,320
probably more than once so it can do a

761
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,480
lot of things it is complicated but it

762
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,399
is possible to only just use that one

763
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,840
favorite tool you have in there you

764
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,760
don't need to use all of these you know

765
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,919
tools um you can just use the knife or

766
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,480
you can just only use a screwdriver um

767
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,200
so you pick what you want and uh and

768
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,640
don't worry too much about all the other

769
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,840
things that are there

770
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,960
um

771
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,640
modern software comes with fairly good

772
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,559
defaults so so configuration should be

773
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,080
fairly minimal

774
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,919
um

775
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,320
and so so

776
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,159
don't be too daunted by your big tool

777
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,840
you can you can you can use it pretty

778
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,120
easily

779
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,678
next slide

780
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,960
so one tricky thing is that uh what's

781
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,480
quite different from other things such

782
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,399
as such as tls is that ipsec consists of

783
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,399
kind of two protocols one is the control

784
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,279
channel

785
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,960
which is the internet key exchange that

786
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,279
is used to negotiate everything

787
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,039
and of course it has to be done securely

788
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,039
so it itself is also using a whole

789
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,399
crypto

790
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,200
set

791
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,600
um so so it will do an encrypted uh

792
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,120
session and then once it has an

793
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,159
encrypted session um

794
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,159
it will it will then be able to actually

795
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,720
negotiate the ipsec and create the

796
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,799
actual data plane where the packet

797
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,559
encryption is configured in usually in

798
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,720
the kernel

799
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,799
there are different

800
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
protocols for doing that or there's

801
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,240
encapsulated security payload which is

802
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,679
the one you would be using which is just

803
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,080
the sort of standard packet encryption

804
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,159
there used to be or technically still is

805
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,840
authenticated header which is the

806
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,440
non-encryption one

807
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,399
um

808
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,519
mostly due to you know 25 years ago

809
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,480
export regulations limited cpu powers of

810
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,200
doing things

811
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,880
if you really need something like that

812
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
these days um you can use null

813
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,760
encryption with esp so so ah you really

814
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,000
try to remove it to at least somewhat

815
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,200
simplify

816
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,399
the whole ipsec suite

817
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
then sd communication because this is a

818
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,200
two-step process you've got the user

819
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,039
land configuring things to the kernel

820
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,640
you need a protocol to talk in between

821
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,039
there so a pf key is the sort of

822
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,519
standard old one that has been used and

823
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,480
uh

824
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
and that's still in use uh with a lot of

825
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,240
a lot of uh

826
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,799
machines such as the bsds linux had to

827
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,559
do its own thing so there's linux

828
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,039
netlink uh that's using a different

829
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,279
protocol

830
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,679
you can read up on the rfcs but you

831
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,519
probably don't have to worry about it

832
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
next slide

833
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,679
i

834
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,200
previously talked about this so the ike

835
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,760
protocol establishes the the state and

836
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,919
authenticates and authorizes the peer

837
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,279
and then it will negotiate ipsec

838
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,399
um

839
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,960
just for uh for to avoid some confusion

840
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,519
um when you send an ipacket and you get

841
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,279
a reply back that's what they call an

842
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,360
exchange so it's not like

843
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,880
like exchange is sort of a word that's

844
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,279
being used in different um

845
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,880
different ways with different protocols

846
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,279
but but for ike it really means

847
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,600
you know a request and a response that

848
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,240
go together

849
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,879
next slide

850
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,159
some other confusing terminology and

851
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,840
this is really because things are like

852
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,279
you know 25

853
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,480
25 30 30 years old

854
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,200
um and and so things have changed and uh

855
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,159
without

856
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,159
dragging up too much mud and old things

857
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,519
from the past

858
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,720
um

859
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,640
be aware that some terms are used

860
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,960
interchangeably depending on the year of

861
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,279
the documentation was published so

862
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,600
while i prefer personally to talk about

863
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,159
ike assay i say sends for security

864
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,799
association and it's basically the the

865
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,519
state uh with all the um all the

866
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,279
information in there

867
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,159
i personally use iksa and ipsec assay if

868
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,200
i formally according to the igv2 spec

869
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,960
would be talking i would only be talking

870
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,840
about parent sa and child sa

871
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,679
i find that personally more confusing to

872
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,960
people

873
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,240
so i use i can say an ipsec assay

874
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,799
next slide

875
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,919
so what does ibsec provide

876
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,320
roughly speaking there's like

877
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,159
three three things you can do with it

878
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,640
you can do a host to host encryption

879
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,559
um where it's only really one host to

880
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,880
one host um it has some advantages that

881
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,080
you don't have to

882
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,240
um encrypt everything including a full

883
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,559
ip header and this network's a network

884
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,399
encrypted and that can be like very easy

885
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,679
you can have multiple networks to

886
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,399
multiple networks you can have zero zero

887
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,600
as your network

888
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,519
um this is like the

889
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,360
the tool that is these days used

890
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,320
everywhere to hook up things together um

891
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,519
for instance i have ip addresses in

892
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,760
in holland i live in canada

893
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,839
um i use ipsec to tunnel some of those

894
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,599
securely to my home so i have more than

895
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,599
one ip address

896
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,960
my visitors don't like it as much

897
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
because google appears in dutch but

898
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,159
otherwise it works really well and

899
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,839
secure

900
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,000
other people use it for connecting

901
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,399
hypervisors making sure that there's a

902
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,199
multi-tenant isolation

903
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,480
vxlan encryptions

904
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,760
tunneling

905
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,719
over

906
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,599
gre over an ipsec tunnel like it is

907
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,199
really sort of a you know secure

908
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,800
ethernet cable that you can stick in

909
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,599
there

910
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,000
and and you can you can tie it down as

911
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,760
much as you want um

912
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,280
some people tie down a lot with the

913
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,560
policies and you can be very specific um

914
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,000
others use it more as a virtual

915
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,760
interface meaning that if the packet

916
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,679
hits the interface it then it must be

917
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,359
part of the policy and you send it and

918
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,520
encrypt it

919
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,760
the fourth uh key point encrypted entire

920
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,320
internet by default um that was sort of

921
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,440
a goal

922
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,480
set out 25 years ago um

923
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,119
didn't really make it happen um

924
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,000
so i bow down to tls and let's encrypt

925
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,720
an acme for for actually mostly getting

926
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,839
that done

927
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,200
good job i wish we we could have done it

928
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,759
next slide

929
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,280
so

930
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,040
getting down to the core rfc rfc 433

931
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,119
encapsulated security payload is sort of

932
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,720
the core of of the ipsec packets

933
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,880
um

934
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
it is protocol number 50 and i say they

935
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,359
are not port 50 because that is probably

936
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,320
the most uh hurt support question when

937
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
people can't get it to work because they

938
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,160
see the number 50 they just assume it's

939
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,119
like udp 50 or tcp 50. they don't

940
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,880
understand that esp is a different

941
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,560
protocol because

942
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,760
most

943
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,160
non-ietf humans have only heard of like

944
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,240
udp tcp and icmp and they don't know

945
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,520
about anything else

946
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,760
um so that is in practice this is a bit

947
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,440
of a problem um

948
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,000
i'll get back to that later

949
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,839
so what is it what is a packet like that

950
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,599
uh look like it's a fairly standard like

951
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,240
it it's it's similar to to how the

952
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,839
lesson groups think it's similar to how

953
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,160
other other encryption protocols work

954
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,680
because it's actually mostly the

955
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,000
property of the of the cryptography

956
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,320
um there's some identifying answers to

957
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,520
um

958
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,599
to detect which uh tunnels if you have

959
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,680
more than one ipsec connection you want

960
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,200
to be able to distinguish them so the

961
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,720
spies are there

962
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,800
um you see that there's some some

963
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,760
algorithm

964
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
agility options in the packets you can

965
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,599
we can add to aad that we couldn't do

966
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,960
initially

967
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,560
um there's free play protection via

968
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,240
sequence numbers so even though you can

969
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,079
see encrypted packets you can't replay

970
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,160
them and make make something happen

971
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,720
does traffic's like us in them uh that

972
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,119
can sort of dictate policy for for what

973
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,560
is uh what is

974
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,920
which packets are allowed to go in and

975
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,040
out

976
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,119
um and you can do padding you can send

977
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,040
obfuscation packets that are basically

978
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,520
like empty packets just to make it

979
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,760
harder for for an observer to figure out

980
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,160
what's exactly going on

981
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,240
it supports compression

982
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,839
it's a really complicated story i really

983
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,920
don't want to get into right now

984
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,640
but

985
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,160
in general you're just better off not

986
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,839
not

987
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,359
trying um you can also do very high

988
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,480
speed things um the the limiting

989
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,599
uh

990
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,119
factor on the protocol used to be the

991
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,560
sequence number but with extended

992
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,640
sequence number we basically just

993
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,359
display the last bits and we remember

994
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,800
the higher bits and don't send them over

995
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,640
the wire but we make them part of the

996
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,920
the calculation of the crypto and the

997
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,240
the signature checks um so you can

998
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,880
actually reach like a 100 gig or more

999
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
per second speeds

1000
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,119
there are some practical problems but

1001
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,040
but but the protocol allows it so next

1002
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,440
slide

1003
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,720
oh i think i

1004
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,160
lost my first

1005
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,839
viewer there we go um so i just put it

1006
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,920
on here um just for sort of completeness

1007
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,400
sake um i don't really want to go into

1008
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,200
too much detail but

1009
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,598
the next slide

1010
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,720
um so there's there's kind of two modes

1011
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,560
um there's transport mode and tunnel

1012
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,720
mode and transform mode is really used

1013
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,560
for the host to host and it has less

1014
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,760
overhead it doesn't um it it reuses part

1015
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,280
of the ip header and and protects uh the

1016
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,560
parts of the ip header that can be

1017
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,800
protected that that don't change between

1018
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
hops

1019
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
and and the good thing is that there's

1020
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,880
less overhead so you get a more of your

1021
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,320
original mtu

1022
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,720
um it generally is faster to look up

1023
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,560
because like a kernel only has to look

1024
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,400
up the the source destination ip address

1025
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,320
it doesn't have to match up any other

1026
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,800
policies because it can only be host to

1027
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,240
host so the

1028
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
encryption policy and where you send the

1029
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,599
packets to or where you've seen the

1030
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,040
packets on are the same ip addresses

1031
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,800
of course this completely fails with nat

1032
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,880
as soon as that happens then things get

1033
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,320
rewritten

1034
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,640
there's various clever hacks to make it

1035
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,280
work anyway that's how sort of microsoft

1036
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,240
kept l2p with ip second transport mode

1037
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
through net

1038
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,160
working and when i say sort of working

1039
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,960
um you can see the last line there it is

1040
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,359
what you end up is in ip pack it into

1041
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,000
ppp packet into an l2p packet into an

1042
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,640
esp packet into a udp packet

1043
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,839
and that's just what you're doing

1044
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,520
yourself then your isp is probably doing

1045
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,920
something like ppoe so this is pretty

1046
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,200
terrible

1047
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,400
uh an empty uf of the inner packet there

1048
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,079
are useless to be set to something like

1049
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,480
1200 to even have a chance to to make it

1050
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,000
over the internet

1051
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
um

1052
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
and then there's of course issues um

1053
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,720
because

1054
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,119
you're using sort of the pre-netted ip

1055
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,480
address

1056
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,240
you get issues on the server where the

1057
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,000
server has like multiple connections to

1058
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,040
the same

1059
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,599
pre-net ip address to different entities

1060
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,440
so now it needs to do more complicated

1061
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,839
state to separate these

1062
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,240
so long story short transport

1063
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
mode uh is great for host host

1064
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,079
encryption in your data center or

1065
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,440
wherever you where you control

1066
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,119
everything in your own cloud where you

1067
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,000
can do this um as soon as you like sort

1068
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,920
of go through an administrative boundary

1069
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,599
where there's something like net

1070
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,280
involved

1071
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,040
you're better off just not using

1072
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,720
transport mode

1073
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,279
next slide

1074
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,000
so tunnel mode

1075
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,240
is conceptually a little easier you just

1076
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,520
have a packet that you want to encrypt

1077
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,040
so you encrypt it and then you stuff it

1078
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,400
into another packet this is like

1079
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,720
conceptually it's much easier

1080
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,319
of course the the the problem is that

1081
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,839
there's a whole new ip header because

1082
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,520
you create a whole new packet so you you

1083
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,319
lose a little bit more mtu

1084
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,920
now you need to be careful with policies

1085
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,079
because if the inner packets for

1086
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,000
instance has

1087
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,800
let's say 888 as a source address

1088
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
um you don't really want to reply to

1089
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,160
google dns

1090
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,760
with your ancestor so you have to be

1091
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,319
sure to to understand what it is that

1092
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,079
you're receiving and sending and making

1093
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,240
sure that those policies match what you

1094
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
actually have negotiated or what is

1095
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,760
allowed to be be transported in the

1096
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,520
tunnel but the good thing is that you

1097
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,440
can you can have sort of arbitrary

1098
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,560
ciders that can go through the tunnel

1099
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,000
um

1100
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,760
there's still an issue that that esp

1101
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,200
doesn't really transfer over the

1102
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,079
internet um so what usually happens is

1103
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,920
that it gets stuffed into udp packet

1104
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,599
then the outer packet doesn't really

1105
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,200
matter because you just look at the

1106
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,119
crypto from the inside encrypted packet

1107
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,040
anyway so it doesn't matter it gets

1108
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,280
rewritten by nat routers and you can

1109
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,560
just sort of

1110
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,800
decapsulate it

1111
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,680
later

1112
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,920
in the kernel

1113
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,160
next slide

1114
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,599
so encapsulating usb packets um like i

1115
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,599
said there's a bunch of rfcs initially

1116
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,319
we were doing espn udp that worked quite

1117
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,480
well

1118
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,079
there were some issues early on in the

1119
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,920
days with uh

1120
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
nat routers trying to be helpful they

1121
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,599
sort of

1122
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,280
tried to be too helpful sort of screwed

1123
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,920
our original ike port which is on 500 so

1124
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,400
um the protocol switched to port 4500 to

1125
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,960
avoid these helpful assistants

1126
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,319
um

1127
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,800
and so that that is usually still in use

1128
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
um to to transport ipsec over the

1129
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
internet so it's encapsulated over port

1130
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,119
4500.

1131
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,720
the disadvantage of course is very

1132
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,400
easily blocked um

1133
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,960
if you blockboard 4500 then you you

1134
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,040
there's no no ipsec coming out of your

1135
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,720
network

1136
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,400
you could use you could use a different

1137
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,319
port um

1138
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,680
in in my experience

1139
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,720
at least be before the onset of quick

1140
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,599
um is that almost all udp if you go to

1141
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,839
to a hotel or if you go to a coffee shop

1142
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,680
you have a good chance that all udp

1143
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,760
except dns is blocked and a dns udp is

1144
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,680
redirected to the local server

1145
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,119
and so your best bet is to actually get

1146
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,440
tcp out and that's also what other other

1147
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,520
vendors found

1148
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,599
so there were some non-standard ways of

1149
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,720
doing tcp encapsulation of ipsec

1150
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,720
of course remember this is a terrible

1151
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,960
idea because if your inside connection

1152
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,640
is a tcp connection and your outside

1153
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,640
connection is a tsp connection

1154
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,079
and there's some kind of packet loss

1155
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,920
happening then then you have like two

1156
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,400
tcp layers fighting each other over how

1157
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,040
how to re-transmit and what to do

1158
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,440
so it's really a last-ditch effort to

1159
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,280
get your packets out

1160
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,160
um

1161
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,200
and so

1162
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,880
there's actually quite some talk about

1163
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,040
how to best do this and that's in an rfc

1164
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,800
a229

1165
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,480
that talks about how to do encapsulation

1166
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,800
with tcp and how to continuously try to

1167
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,400
move back to udp because it's just so

1168
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,079
much better because you don't run into

1169
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,240
all these issues

1170
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,599
there was some interesting thing of

1171
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,079
course at itf we don't

1172
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,240
advertise people break administrative

1173
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,000
boundaries

1174
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,079
so there's there's a bit of talk about

1175
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,560
if you if someone accidentally happens

1176
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,359
to block let's say port 443 or other

1177
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,319
ports

1178
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,359
um you could multiplex this so you could

1179
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,720
you you could pretend you're a tls

1180
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,920
connection

1181
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,640
um there happens to be a prefix in the

1182
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,440
in the in the tcp encapsulation for i

1183
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,280
can esp packets

1184
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,440
um so that you can actually demux it so

1185
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,520
you can actually have a server that runs

1186
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,200
tls and um encapsulated

1187
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,760
icon and ipsec packets

1188
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,079
um it was a bit tricky because like it

1189
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,839
sort of breaks what we are supposed to

1190
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,359
do with itf it is sort of a

1191
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,440
circumvention technique but

1192
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,200
but we were also seeing that not having

1193
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,200
this this circumvention technique really

1194
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,240
caused the plethora of non-standardized

1195
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,760
vpn protocols to be out there

1196
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,359
and so we really kind of had to do this

1197
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,920
so um it's a interesting political

1198
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,160
maneuvering uh

1199
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,640
next slide

1200
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,440
so how are these these these policies

1201
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,319
managed um so inside the cur usually

1202
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,839
it's in the kernel um for embedded

1203
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,359
devices obviously you might not have the

1204
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,359
separation between kernel and user land

1205
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,680
i'm speaking more from like a generic os

1206
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,440
point of view

1207
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
but if you look at the the the policy in

1208
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,960
the data state that you have you've got

1209
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,040
the security policy database and the

1210
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,680
security association database the

1211
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,200
security association database is like

1212
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,720
the endpoint

1213
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,480
information which crypto keys are you

1214
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,480
using which host do you need to send the

1215
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,160
packet to on what port which what

1216
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,480
protocol

1217
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,440
and

1218
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,119
you've got things like counters sequence

1219
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,960
numbers to make sure that your crypto is

1220
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,400
going right

1221
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,079
then the security policy database

1222
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,680
basically has to

1223
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,720
see if it the list of rules to see to

1224
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,520
say

1225
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,720
i have a packet i need to encrypt it

1226
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,160
which policy applies who does it go to

1227
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,240
is it the right

1228
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,880
ip addresses traffic selectors

1229
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,640
and which which then which state to use

1230
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,079
these entries are unidirectional so

1231
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,440
you've got one for inbound one for

1232
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,359
outbound if you got like an ipsec

1233
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,040
connection you you actually have two

1234
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,079
states

1235
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,160
in the kernel one for for in and on for

1236
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,400
out and then same for policy

1237
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,359
so next slide

1238
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,680
um it's probably hard to see but if you

1239
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,520
later look at the presentation or maybe

1240
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,800
people online

1241
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,960
can see better um this is an example

1242
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,760
from from the linux output of the uh of

1243
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,160
the sad entry this is one entry i just

1244
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
did earlier today

1245
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,119
bringing up a vpn from the idf network

1246
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,359
to my server in amsterdam

1247
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,599
um so it gives you sort of a rough idea

1248
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,040
of the parameters involved and there's

1249
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,400
the state capped

1250
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,960
next slide

1251
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,440
and same for the policy so here you can

1252
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,200
see the policy database

1253
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,839
entry for it you see a third one because

1254
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,760
in tunnel mode there's this sort of ip

1255
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,319
in ip and the way linux has done this is

1256
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,160
with a sort of what they call a forward

1257
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,720
rule um so so you've got inbound and

1258
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,400
outbound and forward

1259
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,319
and forward is where

1260
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,520
you can

1261
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,200
things can happen to

1262
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,359
you can also filter filter on things

1263
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,480
there

1264
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,960
and do other tricks

1265
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,200
next slide

1266
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,200
puppy intermission i haven't lost anyone

1267
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,040
everyone's still here um i haven't run

1268
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,960
out of time so it's all good so now

1269
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,720
we've only talked about the the sort of

1270
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,240
ipsec part so now we'll talk a little

1271
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,920
bit more about the ike part so next

1272
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,640
slide

1273
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,280
um so ike negotiates all the parameters

1274
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,480
both for ike itself and for ipsec um it

1275
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,920
starts off with a ephemeral

1276
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,319
diffie-hellman exchange i was quite

1277
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,160
surprised coming come

1278
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,040
i've done ipsec longer than than tls i

1279
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,960
was quite surprised to find out that

1280
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,200
that tls wasn't really common to do

1281
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,880
ephemeral diffie-hellman exchange and

1282
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,640
have perfect or secrecy inside and that

1283
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,200
there were static keys on tls servers

1284
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,680
that were used i was i was shocked when

1285
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,359
i found it out first i was like really

1286
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,119
surprised like but

1287
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,680
30 years ago ipsec already did this like

1288
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,400
why why is this still happening um very

1289
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,599
surprised

1290
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,839
um anyway um so after dielman there's uh

1291
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,599
there's a peer authentication and

1292
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,640
there's a

1293
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,520
authorization as well um usually that's

1294
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,559
x509 could be based on

1295
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,720
made up strings for ids com

1296
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,280
in combination with a pre-shared key

1297
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,680
could be an eep method there's various

1298
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,839
ways of doing that

1299
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,680
now once that's done you can then

1300
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,319
negotiate one or more ipsec connections

1301
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,000
where you then negotiate the traffic

1302
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,480
selectors like source destination uh

1303
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,960
between the two between the two networks

1304
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,079
um

1305
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,240
then you've all have to keep this alive

1306
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,079
um

1307
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,760
usually that involves things like make

1308
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,440
sure that if you're behind net you send

1309
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,400
netkeeper lives because on busy gateways

1310
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,559
with telcos if you don't send packets or

1311
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,400
receive packages for 20 seconds your net

1312
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,240
mappings vanish and so

1313
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,319
if you're doing encapsulation over over

1314
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,760
a port and you need to keep that port

1315
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,880
open

1316
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,880
um there's also a wreaking happening

1317
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,400
after a while when you've sent too many

1318
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,160
packets or when you spend too much time

1319
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,680
using the same key you want to change

1320
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,680
over your keys to provide perfect

1321
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,920
forward secrecy so to hold this kind of

1322
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,400
maintenance layer

1323
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,319
in addition to the initial provisioning

1324
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,480
that happens in the ike protocol

1325
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,680
the next slide

1326
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,800
so originally um 1998 rfc 2409 um i

1327
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,880
think the author's in the room yes

1328
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,640
the editor author

1329
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,119
is in a room thank you very much um and

1330
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,680
um i really want to say that um even

1331
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,400
though i've been making uh moves to uh

1332
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,960
to make this historic it is still secure

1333
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,559
it hasn't really been broken there have

1334
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,200
been some weak configurations have been

1335
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,240
implementation uh problems where the

1336
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,640
complexity has led to to code mistakes

1337
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,960
and buffer overflows and

1338
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,520
compromises but the core of the protocol

1339
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,599
is still so good that we really had a

1340
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,359
hard time moving people from mike v1 to

1341
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,040
like v2 like um and and to this day

1342
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,720
people are still happily running running

1343
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,640
ike v1 and and

1344
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,960
um as long as they have like aes and

1345
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,400
sha1 even

1346
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,480
as long as they don't use a tiffy helmet

1347
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,839
group that's like less than 2048 it's

1348
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,359
actually still pretty good like there

1349
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,800
are some some things where you know

1350
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,319
we've we've improved on on the years but

1351
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,960
it's actually a really pretty solid

1352
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,319
document there's been no no

1353
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,920
cryptographic attacks that broke it or

1354
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,839
anything and so in that sense

1355
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,280
even though people don't like to hear it

1356
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,440
i feel that it's been been more stable

1357
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,119
and secure than tls which has seen a

1358
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,720
number of attacks that like are so

1359
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,480
fundamental that the villa to quickly

1360
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,760
kill the old tls versions

1361
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,040
next slide

1362
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,880
um so there are many extensions the net

1363
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,880
reversal was one uh dead peer detection

1364
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,880
was another one that was mostly needed

1365
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,800
also because of interference with net

1366
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,079
routers um there were new algorithms

1367
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,839
there were more configuration happening

1368
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,280
dns

1369
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,640
windows

1370
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,760
net bios other things were added

1371
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,960
mode cfg was added to to to to also

1372
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,280
configure and do multiple things

1373
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,760
additional authentication

1374
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,440
all of these things added also multiple

1375
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,000
round trips and also on on a model that

1376
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,920
didn't really do retransmits very right

1377
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,720
so

1378
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,240
so what happens was that both sides

1379
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,240
would start ending up re-transmitting it

1380
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,760
would very much complicate the state

1381
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,599
machine in our code um

1382
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,520
our

1383
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,200
implementation i'm working on the ikv 2

1384
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,559
state machine is actually much nicer

1385
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,200
than that v1 state machine

1386
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,280
and again it's not because ike v1 is bad

1387
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,480
it's just that it had some different

1388
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,200
design goals

1389
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,280
one interesting one is that for instance

1390
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,680
ike v1 is more secure against quantum

1391
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,319
computer attacks than ikv2 but it came

1392
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,559
at a hefty price namely that if you

1393
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,440
somehow uh did the authentication wrong

1394
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,359
you would just get encrypted goblet you

1395
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,040
you couldn't read so you couldn't get

1396
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,839
proper nice error messages um so so it's

1397
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,359
all been like

1398
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,440
different considerations putting the

1399
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,119
weight somewhere else it's not that that

1400
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,119
the iphone's actually broken

1401
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,400
um

1402
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,640
next slide

1403
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,800
um

1404
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,280
one issue was um amplification attacks

1405
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,850
and and dos attacks

1406
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,079
[Music]

1407
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,000
because of the the retransmit not being

1408
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,319
strictly done by only one site and they

1409
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,160
would go to both ways and also there's a

1410
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,000
dos attack where you can trigger more

1411
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,079
packets than more than one packet in a

1412
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,359
reply

1413
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:24,240
um

1414
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,839
sometimes that's implementation for

1415
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,359
instance at some point i was

1416
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,240
for i noticed that for one year one i

1417
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,920
paired us on the internet every 30

1418
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,680
seconds sent me an ike packet and it was

1419
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,480
because i once sent them one packet

1420
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,079
um

1421
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,440
so so so

1422
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,119
although that's obviously not a protocol

1423
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,760
error but an implementation error

1424
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,359
but dos attacks is is an important thing

1425
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,680
to fix there are many modes that also

1426
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,359
confuse people main mode aggressive mode

1427
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,520
revised mode hybrid mode

1428
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,040
revised and hybrid were not really used

1429
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,520
but main mode in aggressive mode was

1430
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,119
main mode is a

1431
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,119
more round trips but protects more

1432
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,720
identity information

1433
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,480
against passive attackers aggressive

1434
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,040
mode basically said well we prefer

1435
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,240
less round trips to set up the

1436
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,040
connection but we'll kind of leak the um

1437
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,119
identity of the peer and the clear it's

1438
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,640
probably okay anyway because if you're

1439
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,079
connecting to a vpn server most likely

1440
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,319
that is a well-known server with a dns

1441
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,680
entry on a well-known ip address

1442
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,760
so so it wasn't wasn't considered that

1443
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,200
important but the problem with

1444
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
aggressive mode was that the crypto was

1445
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,599
slightly different and it was actually

1446
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,160
possible to do um offline dictionary

1447
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,920
attacks if you're if you're using

1448
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,359
pre-shared keys and you were using a

1449
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,440
really weak one

1450
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,599
so so that has been the the

1451
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,440
the biggest problem of ikv one and it's

1452
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,720
it's it's again it's the humans

1453
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
configuring it badly it's not that much

1454
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,040
a protocol even though like you know

1455
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,559
maybe we should be aware that we should

1456
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,839
make protocols strong enough

1457
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:01,279
to protect against weak humans

1458
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,200
so so

1459
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,359
the extensions as well for exotherm mode

1460
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,079
config that were very popular took many

1461
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,520
round trips

1462
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,119
so that slow things down a bit as well

1463
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,040
if you wanted to do many tunnels so many

1464
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,559
different ip addresses you'd have to set

1465
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,720
up one abuse tunnel for each one of them

1466
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,880
that at some point also runs into

1467
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,720
scaling issues

1468
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,760
um

1469
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,800
and one i found um

1470
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,319
in our own implementation at the time

1471
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,079
was that not all the fields in an ike

1472
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,599
packet are actually integrally protected

1473
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,520
so you've got things like vendor ids

1474
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,520
that you could actually um that they

1475
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,440
weren't part of the the signature of all

1476
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,559
the data

1477
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,720
um and so you could actually modify them

1478
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,920
and and do maybe weird things um

1479
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,280
we found it out because the software i

1480
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,960
was working on at the time

1481
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,480
tried to be clever to putting a

1482
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,280
vendor id payload in that basically said

1483
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,280
we can do ike v2 why didn't why did you

1484
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,960
talk if you want to us and we thought we

1485
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,559
really clever to prevent a downgrade

1486
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,640
attack but the attacker could just strip

1487
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,079
it out because it wasn't actually part

1488
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,520
of the

1489
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,040
of the signature

1490
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,559
so there's actually no way to do to

1491
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,640
prevent a downgrade attack unfortunately

1492
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,200
so um if you're migrating it's better to

1493
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,200
to be aware of this and

1494
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,720
try to do it quickly

1495
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,439
um next slide

1496
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,200
it's like video improvements um

1497
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,720
so it's actually so so one thing that

1498
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,160
was kind of

1499
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,559
neat about ike v1 was that you could

1500
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,480
start your ike protocol

1501
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,240
you could negotiate ipsec assays and

1502
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,160
then you could tear down the ike state

1503
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,760
like you don't need it anymore the ipsec

1504
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,839
state is there and by the time your your

1505
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,760
ipsec assays are about to expire then

1506
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,079
you could re-trigger and do a new ike

1507
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,920
negotiation and bring up bring up that

1508
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,480
state that worked really well until

1509
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,920
we had to do things like that peer

1510
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,599
detection because at that point you

1511
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,280
always needed to have that that i can

1512
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,520
say information there because you needed

1513
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,440
to send like hey are you still there yes

1514
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,720
i'm still here

1515
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,160
and for that you needed that crypto

1516
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,240
state that was part of the i can say so

1517
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,760
so in practice you couldn't really work

1518
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,480
anymore without that so in ikv2 um if

1519
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,400
the iksa vanishes it basically takes

1520
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,960
down all of its ipsec assay children as

1521
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,799
well so that it's it's one bundle that

1522
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,319
you have to keep keep

1523
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,240
keep there

1524
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,000
retransmetrofix only the initiator

1525
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,240
re-transmits so um the responder just

1526
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,400
sends an answer and it's all the

1527
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,240
responsibility to initiate it avoids a

1528
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,319
lot of race conditions

1529
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,319
there are some anti-ddos protection

1530
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,640
added so um if you're seeing too many

1531
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,880
connections you could send cookies and

1532
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,559
if they they don't come back with the

1533
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,400
right cookie then you can sort of ignore

1534
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,280
them

1535
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,240
um

1536
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,799
they even extended that to to to puzzles

1537
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,640
which you which is sort of a proof of

1538
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,559
work uh kind of uh

1539
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,960
thing where you even put more cpu usage

1540
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,000
on a client before they're allowed to

1541
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,440
connect so there are some good good

1542
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,440
protection mechanisms there

1543
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,200
um

1544
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,960
another important one is that the the

1545
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,720
round trips were reduced by combining

1546
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,960
the establishment of the iksa with the

1547
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,440
first ipsec essay so you can sort of do

1548
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,520
a few things in a somewhat faster way so

1549
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,520
you don't have to have as many round

1550
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,200
trips before you get your first ipsec

1551
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,280
essay going

1552
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,760
um support for eep was added

1553
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,359
eep is

1554
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,520
it's interesting um because for instance

1555
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,359
one of the most popular modes of

1556
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,920
authentication with um

1557
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,400
with with i can ipsec is eep tls which

1558
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,640
basically means you're running a tls

1559
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,960
connection inside your eye connection to

1560
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,079
sort of uh to you to eat back-end to to

1561
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,960
um to authenticate that's a lot of round

1562
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,200
trips like eight or more and so so for

1563
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,520
instance um if you're using microsoft

1564
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,359
windows you can use eptls for your vpn

1565
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,559
tunnel and then you don't need

1566
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,240
administrative access on your on your

1567
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,839
machine but if you're using straight

1568
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,319
certificates it's considered a host or

1569
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,520
machine property and then you need

1570
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,319
administrative access to get that so

1571
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,079
while you could do the exact same thing

1572
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,319
with just simple certificates without

1573
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,240
administrative access you suddenly have

1574
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,240
to use ipt less and you're like eight to

1575
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,079
ten round trips further down before you

1576
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,640
have your your ipsec tunnel up

1577
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,400
um so

1578
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,400
not as nice but um

1579
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,559
but anyway the support is there i

1580
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,079
um

1581
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,520
if you can avoid eep i would i would

1582
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,359
avoid e personally

1583
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,799
um there's the combination of many

1584
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,319
traffic saxophones you can have like a

1585
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,520
lot of traffic selectors

1586
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,280
so that if you have many subnets you

1587
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,799
don't have to set up an ipsec tunnel for

1588
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,480
each subnet you can just set one of them

1589
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,520
up for all the subnets

1590
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,400
so next slide

1591
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,480
so icv2 there's some evolution through

1592
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,480
some documents that i've listed there

1593
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,720
um sort of the modes like the the main

1594
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,319
aggressive modes sort of underway but

1595
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,599
we've we've slowly been adding exchanges

1596
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:44,480
um

1597
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,440
to to do things like post quantum and

1598
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,520
other things but the basic mode is

1599
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,119
there's one exchange

1600
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,280
i can say in it that is the divi helmet

1601
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,799
then there's one exchange that does the

1602
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,720
auth and which also has enough

1603
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,760
information for for samsung ipsec assay

1604
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,839
if you want more

1605
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,920
different ipsec assays you can use to

1606
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,480
create child essay to to establish more

1607
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,920
and there's an informational exchange

1608
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,480
for doing various management things that

1609
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,920
peer detection

1610
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,400
mobile mobility updates deletes and

1611
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,720
those are all additions in ikev1 they're

1612
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,160
all sort of part of the course back in

1613
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,920
night v2

1614
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,480
next slide

1615
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,920
so some interesting extensions mobike

1616
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,960
mobility and multi-home basically

1617
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,520
you can set up an eye connection

1618
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,280
with an ipsec connection then you can

1619
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,720
probe from a second entry so for

1620
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,000
instance you've got a phone has two

1621
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
interfaces you can use the second

1622
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,160
interface to send an informational

1623
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,000
packet to the other end saying hey by

1624
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,280
the way it could also be that you're

1625
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,760
going to send packets uh to to this ip

1626
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,319
address here um and this is an

1627
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,400
authenticated way so it's not just

1628
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,000
looking at the last ip does that you

1629
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,599
receive the packet from and replying to

1630
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,280
it it's actually an authenticated way of

1631
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,440
saying i have different ip addresses

1632
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,280
that i can send and receive these

1633
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,720
packets on so

1634
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,040
if my wi-fi link goes down let's go use

1635
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,240
my my lte link

1636
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,480
um this session resumption obviously

1637
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,040
also to sort of help mostly the phone

1638
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,720
case use with your phone goes to sleep

1639
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,000
it wakes up you can do session

1640
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,359
resumption

1641
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,799
um

1642
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,040
various algorithm updates uh poli

1643
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,119
cha-cha algorithms were added to kind of

1644
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,079
modern things asgcm

1645
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,000
was already added to ipsec but not to

1646
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,040
igv1 it was added to ikv2

1647
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,280
mike fragmentation support um there was

1648
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,119
sort of a non-standard way nike v1 of

1649
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,880
doing that um it's been standards and

1650
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,079
ikv2 in a much nicer way

1651
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,480
so so the ikev1 version if you got one

1652
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,640
corrupted corrupted fragment you sort of

1653
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,160
screwed with all of them you have to get

1654
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,480
all of them back like v2 has a nicer way

1655
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,760
where you sort of authenticate the

1656
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,559
fragments by themselves so um if you're

1657
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,079
missing one then you can just get the

1658
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,599
one back

1659
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,520
um so so it's it's a harder it's it's

1660
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,839
harder to to do a denial of service by

1661
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,920
just making sure you you will always get

1662
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,559
one fragment bogus fragments and sent to

1663
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:03,680
uh

1664
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,200
before the real one

1665
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,359
um is the intermediate exchange uh this

1666
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,599
is to support uh post quantum key blobs

1667
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,160
that are really big so they don't fit in

1668
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,559
one udp pack it back and forth so this

1669
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,559
intermediate exchange is sort of a chain

1670
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,720
of events that can happen in between the

1671
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,000
i can say init and ike auth process

1672
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,160
to to sort of get that infrastructure in

1673
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,040
place for for post quantum algorithms

1674
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,359
um there's post quantum pre-shared keys

1675
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:30,799
that thought was the one item that said

1676
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,440
ikv one is more secure with the nike v2

1677
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,920
um so it's been added as an extension to

1678
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,540
ikev2 so you can still add that

1679
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,000
[Music]

1680
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,400
there's a multiple ke draft which is

1681
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,359
like i guess itf has to decide whether

1682
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:49,440
they call it hybrid or composite key

1683
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,520
exchange but it's basically doing your

1684
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,960
classical key exchange with your

1685
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,720
classical algorithms and also doing a

1686
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,480
quantum one and making sure that you can

1687
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,559
test your quantum one while not

1688
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,319
degrading the security of your classic

1689
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,760
one

1690
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,760
so that that work is also happening in

1691
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,880
tls and other places

1692
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,160
and next slide

1693
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,520
um

1694
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,039
so it might have seen that that

1695
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,720
everything i said was pretty complicated

1696
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,960
and you want to run away screaming let

1697
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,200
me just remind you this is my client

1698
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,559
configuration for ipsec on my laptop

1699
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,480
um you can just see you know left pick

1700
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,559
up any any ip address left certificate

1701
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,039
is my actually have an eye certificate

1702
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,359
um i'm saying give me everything you got

1703
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,760
for left subnet and write subnet so for

1704
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,160
the local and remote subnets you see

1705
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,680
narrowing is yes so i'll let the server

1706
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,839
narrow me down so the server will

1707
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,520
narrow the selectors down to one ip

1708
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,119
address and that is like you know my my

1709
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,920
dhcp obtained ip address that i then use

1710
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,880
and next slide

1711
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,480
so this is the server side of that same

1712
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,079
configuration

1713
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,680
more or less the same it just specifies

1714
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,930
the ids the ip addresses

1715
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:00,240
[Music]

1716
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,920
and it has like a right address pool

1717
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,240
where it hands me a random like a an

1718
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,720
iphone pool instead

1719
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,599
um gives me dns servers gives me domain

1720
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,280
names

1721
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,200
and

1722
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,839
i guess i'm terminated

1723
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,000
to be fair there was only one slide left

1724
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,680
i'm sorry something hiccuped i lost

1725
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,280
everything and it just reconnected me

1726
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,799
let me get the slide back up

1727
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,160
i mean i spent a lot of work on that

1728
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,720
last slide

1729
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,520
okay so if you're not sleeping i'm open

1730
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,319
for questions suggestions comments

1731
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,119
criticism tomatoes

1732
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,440
and and historic fun facts because

1733
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,720
there's a lot of people here that have

1734
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,039
been here 30 years in a room that might

1735
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,920
have interesting anecdotes

1736
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:02,480
yes this is my puppy

1737
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,119
okay

1738
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,839
thank you

1739
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:22,599
thank you paul

1740
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:29,039
so we are now in the other business

1741
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,640
portion

1742
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,599
so if anyone wants to come up to the mic

1743
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:38,680
to say something please now's the time

1744
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,039
barry

1745
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,799
this is barry lieber well since nobody

1746
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,720
else has anything substantive to say

1747
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,640
i'll i want to just say something about

1748
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,520
ben

1749
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,400
um

1750
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,920
when i was on the iesg with ben we had a

1751
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,079
uh iesg retreat

1752
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,160
where alyssa came up with this game that

1753
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,240
we played where everybody gave

1754
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,079
secretariats some fun facts about

1755
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,400
themselves and we did a little mixer

1756
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,000
where you tried to figure out which fact

1757
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
went with which person

1758
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,520
and that was where i learned that ben is

1759
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,119
one of the most interesting people i

1760
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,720
have ever met

1761
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,039
so if you the next time you see him in

1762
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,280
person start asking him about things

1763
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,680
like when he worked as a blacksmith and

1764
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,799
stuff like that that just

1765
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,160
fascinating

1766
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,879
get to know him

1767
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,599
i do remember that mixer event it was

1768
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,640
very

1769
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,079
very fun

1770
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:39,440
i think we have

1771
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,160
like a bingo card almost of

1772
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,319
different facts and we had to figure out

1773
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,520
who who is from

1774
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,480
stuart i see you in the queue

1775
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,559
good morning all

1776
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:55,760
um

1777
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,920
normally i wouldn't ask such a noob

1778
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,640
question but since uh we just had that

1779
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,720
overview from paul

1780
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,440
i

1781
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,760
i've not been able to find explicit

1782
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,920
documentation in any rfc about the bound

1783
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,720
end to end tunnel mode the beat mode and

1784
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,799
i wonder if you could provide a pointer

1785
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,680
uh

1786
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,559
yeah

1787
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,319
there is a beat mode and there's also

1788
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,400
something called like a wrapped esp mode

1789
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
and so there are a few

1790
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,440
um

1791
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,720
experiments that that were were done

1792
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,480
that weren't very successful and haven't

1793
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,640
really seen much deployment although i

1794
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,160
think there's some interest in doing

1795
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,079
something with beat again but uh but

1796
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,559
terror is giving a more complete answer

1797
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,480
yeah there are given it so be it was

1798
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,839
bitmore was one of those that were

1799
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,720
actually done part of in hip also

1800
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,520
because he was using actually esp also

1801
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,240
and uh there was this uh

1802
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,640
it's actually expired in the aircraft i

1803
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,920
don't think it actually went very well

1804
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,160
there were some interesting i think two

1805
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,240
or three years ago somebody was wanting

1806
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,640
to resurrect it and move it back the

1807
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,280
basic idea there is it's a

1808
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,119
transport mode

1809
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,319
payloads

1810
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,359
internal model semantics so you have

1811
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:15,920
you recreate the tunnel you send the

1812
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,000
packet without the tunnel putting the

1813
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,599
separate ip

1814
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,680
header inside

1815
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,359
but you recreate the ip header from the

1816
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:28,559
outside and and and from the policy so

1817
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,319
instead of taking the ip addresses

1818
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,240
outside of the outer ip addresses and

1819
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,880
putting putting them you take

1820
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,559
throw them away they out their ip

1821
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,160
addresses put them in put in uh

1822
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,960
ipads from the policy and recreate the

1823
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,880
new you know ip header and send out so

1824
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,400
it actually compresses things you don't

1825
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,440
have to send extra ip header and so on

1826
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,960
so that was the main idea there

1827
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,640
okay so all there really is is the

1828
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,880
expired draft right yeah there's

1829
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,119
only the expired draft and i i think

1830
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,400
there's actually a couple of three a

1831
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,079
couple of versions of that because i

1832
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,640
think it expired a couple of times and

1833
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,480
you get the new names but i think if you

1834
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,480
just search for beat i think you can

1835
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,240
find some of the rough

1836
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,640
thank you

1837
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,399
robin you're on the queue top of the

1838
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,479
queue

1839
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:24,640
thanks roman is the audio okay

1840
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,120
good thank you um yeah this is just a

1841
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,080
general observation thinking back sorry

1842
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,000
so robin wilton from the internet

1843
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,679
society not speaking for the internet

1844
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,759
society um

1845
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,839
looking back over this ietf and the

1846
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:39,359
previous one

1847
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,238
i think a really interesting

1848
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,158
development has been the emergence of

1849
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:47,279
these kind of oblivious protocols

1850
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,600
where essentially the general model has

1851
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,560
been

1852
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,279
to take an existing two-party protocol

1853
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,560
and insert an intermediary node

1854
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,399
that can um

1855
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,719
perform a i don't know if this is a verb

1856
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,198
but an obliviating function between the

1857
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:04,158
two

1858
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:05,279
um

1859
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:06,399
and

1860
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,439
i mean so uh oblivious doe is one um

1861
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:11,439
ohio is another one that we've been

1862
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,120
talking about this week

1863
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,560
um so in principle it's it sounds simple

1864
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,520
um i know that in certainly in the dough

1865
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,399
case

1866
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,520
um

1867
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,120
it it gave rise to um some animated

1868
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,198
discussion of pros and cons

1869
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:29,198
and the same thing happened with ohio

1870
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,238
yesterday

1871
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:31,359
um

1872
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,040
you know good good arguments on both

1873
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,719
sides for why people were holding a

1874
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,640
particular view

1875
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,600
and

1876
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,439
thinking of the oh hi discussion

1877
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:40,960
yesterday

1878
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,719
it struck me that

1879
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:43,679
maybe

1880
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,439
we could analyze

1881
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,479
those differences in in opinion

1882
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,279
by looking at the trust model in in a

1883
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,279
fairly generic way

1884
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,560
um

1885
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,239
so just to make it slightly less

1886
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,880
abstract in in the ohi model

1887
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,800
you have a client trying to reach a

1888
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,840
target and you put a proxy in the middle

1889
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,679
so that um

1890
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:06,880
the the

1891
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,840
the

1892
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,239
proxy strips out the client identifier

1893
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,120
so that the the target doesn't know

1894
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,360
who the requests are coming from as a as

1895
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,320
a privacy preserving move

1896
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,480
but as a result

1897
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,800
this intermediate mode is trusted by the

1898
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,560
client to do

1899
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,080
one set of things

1900
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,960
untrusted by the target to do a somewhat

1901
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,440
different set of things

1902
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,560
and

1903
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,199
if either of those trust models is bent

1904
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,800
or abused

1905
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,040
you you you kind of break the model and

1906
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,960
that was i think at the heart of a lot

1907
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,719
of the discussion yesterday

1908
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,960
so i just wondered if looking at this

1909
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,679
general pattern of

1910
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,840
obliviating nodes

1911
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,040
whether there would be some benefit in

1912
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,199
looking at them across you know across

1913
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,600
multiple instances so looking at the doe

1914
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,120
model in the ohio model and so on

1915
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,159
with that

1916
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,080
through that lens through that lens of

1917
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,040
of who is trusting whom to do what

1918
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,280
and and seeing if that tells us anything

1919
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,679
generic about this

1920
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:12,960
principle

1921
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,199
of putting an obliviating intermediary

1922
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,159
into a two-party protocol

1923
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:28,880
yeah i mean there's definitely an

1924
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,640
abstract principle there

1925
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,199
and ben noted that i think ppm might be

1926
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:37,559
another one to add to that list

1927
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,920
yeah and to add a little further you

1928
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,520
know we have a lot of experience

1929
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,120
designing and thinking about two-party

1930
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,120
protocols but i think once we get into

1931
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,199
three parties uh it's a little bit more

1932
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,880
uncharted territory for what we've done

1933
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,400
in the itf so

1934
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,480
yeah uh interesting questions but

1935
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,960
perhaps not straightforward answers

1936
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,199
no worth pursuing

1937
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,960
and that was partly what struck me was

1938
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,480
there are really good arguments on both

1939
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,239
sides in many of those instances and i

1940
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,400
was trying to figure out a way of of

1941
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,719
teasing them apart i see also in the

1942
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,040
chat rus russ has

1943
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,960
maybe suggested floating this in the t

1944
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,080
model

1945
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,679
group which is another good idea thank

1946
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,080
you russ

1947
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,280
yeah i think the the previous like the

1948
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,679
ohio discussions there may be some

1949
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,760
implicit assumptions being made that

1950
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,600
would benefit from being made explicit

1951
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,840
to help

1952
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,199
identify why people are

1953
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,320
strongly holding their different

1954
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,440
positions

1955
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,678
yeah

1956
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,520
donald you're on top of the queue

1957
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,719
i just wanted to mention that there are

1958
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,480
things just like that

1959
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,960
in the non-network world for example

1960
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,800
there are freedom of information act

1961
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,320
queries you can make to government

1962
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,960
agencies at least in the united states

1963
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,640
and the agencies keep a record of

1964
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,800
everybody who's made such a query

1965
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,159
and

1966
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:05,679
i guess the information has been

1967
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,679
returned to them so

1968
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,080
there are companies whose business is to

1969
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,480
accept such requests and then forward

1970
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,120
them to the government agency so all the

1971
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,600
government agencies record say is there

1972
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,120
were a whole bunch of these freedom of

1973
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,640
information act requests for various

1974
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,800
kinds of information and they all came

1975
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,360
from freedom of information incorporated

1976
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,440
which will refuse to say what the actual

1977
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,679
client was that asked them to make the

1978
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:30,800
query

1979
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,679
uh so it's sort of an interesting

1980
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,280
non-network case like that

1981
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,120
yeah and and a

1982
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,640
direct parallel with um part of the ohi

1983
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,719
discussion which was about um

1984
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,000
essentially

1985
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,880
uh

1986
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,280
abusing the protocol to dos

1987
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,719
the target say

1988
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:57,520
um

1989
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,560
and in in the freedom of information um

1990
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,840
use case

1991
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,440
that would essentially be the equivalent

1992
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,360
of what i think is called a vexatious

1993
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,719
inquiry

1994
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,040
where you just deluge the the government

1995
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,440
agency with one inquiry after another

1996
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,560
and

1997
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,199
it's it's essentially a a real-world dos

1998
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,480
attack

1999
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,080
um well the general solution to that in

2000
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,320
the real world like that is you

2001
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,199
the agency goes to a court and uh gets

2002
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:24,719
some sort of injunction against it on

2003
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:26,960
the ground there's an abusive process

2004
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,800
which is generally right but

2005
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,800
right but but if but if the inquiries

2006
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,080
are going through a clearinghouse like

2007
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,159
you say the agency may not know who to

2008
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:36,080
take to court well they can in this case

2009
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,840
they can in order to stop or the

2010
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,960
clearinghouse to stop making the

2011
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,000
enquiries

2012
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,560
right and again direct parallel with uh

2013
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,040
with the ohio case yeah um what what

2014
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,120
what is the target entitled to tell the

2015
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,400
proxy to do

2016
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,239
if it thinks that one of the proxy's

2017
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,280
clients

2018
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,440
is misbehaving

2019
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,199
yeah as a

2020
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,960
as a venue observation we can continue

2021
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,840
to use sag to discuss that and uh model

2022
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,000
