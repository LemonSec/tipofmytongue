okay so but do note well that this is

62
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,320
indeed an ietf meeting for those of us

63
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,240
in the room it almost feels like an ietf

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,759
meeting except that we're missing all of

65
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,680
you who are not in the room with us

66
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,520
who also probably feel like it's an ietf

67
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
meeting because you're up at some

68
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,520

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,240
so but as a reminder that there are

71
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,720
requirements in participating in an ietf

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,160

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560

146
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,839
killing time so that you can talk

147
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,279

all right um so this is the slide that i

154
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,880
wanted to make sure to uh get to

155
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
i think by this point in the day it's

156
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
possible that in-person participants

157
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,760
understand that

158
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
you have to scan the

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,640
the qr code is the fastest way to sign

160
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,959
the blue sheet for this session

161
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,720
but otherwise you can just log into the

162
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,760
on-site tool um which will also log you

163
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,440
into our blue sheets it's how we know

164
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
how many people were here and we can

165
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,480
plan for future meetings so we would

166
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,080
appreciate it if you did

167
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,920
uh plus also we will be running the

168
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,320
question queue out of the meat echo

169
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,200
interface so by signing in using the

170
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
on-site tool you will have access to

171
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
raise your hands

172
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,959
if you just show up at the mic you'll be

173
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,640
showing up at the mic if you want to

174
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,399
speak at the mic you have to put up your

175
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,560
hand and we'll go in the order uh that

176
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,920
the media echo cue shows us

177
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,920
okay i think that is uh and yeah remote

178
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,440
participants please make sure that your

179
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,760
audio and video are off unless you are

180
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,040
sharing presenting or asking a question

181
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,360
um

182
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,680
okay

183
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
and kyle's undisclosed location has

184
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,320
terrible internet so

185
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,320
so he'll just have to make do

186
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,399
all right so the agenda we have noted

187
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,640
well um we have not bashed the agenda we

188
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,959
do have a scribe we have a minutes taker

189
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,120
uh jabber scribe is somebody somebody

190
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,560
willing to say that they'll keep an eye

191
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,600
on the

192
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
chat

193
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
well eric's nodding his head so i think

194
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,240
okay eric will make sure that we don't

195
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,839
lose track of the chat

196
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,640
um

197
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,120
are there any further bashes to the

198
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
agenda

199
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
i did sneak something in just before the

200
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,279
meeting the late ad noted under working

201
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
group docs the discussion of 80 review

202
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
comments on the ops cons document in

203
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
case there's any material there

204
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,079
all right

205
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,040
then

206
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,800
not hearing any bashes to the agenda i

207
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,600
would invite magnus up to tell us about

208
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,160
the mock meeting

209
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,560
so

210
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
yep i'm magnus westland i will talk

211
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
about the media or quick buff which is

212
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
on wednesday at 10 o'clock central

213
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,160
european time so let's go next

214
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,560
slide

215
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,560
so

216
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,079
is

217
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,120
yep

218
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,399
sorry about those online that gets to

219
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,160
scratch it so um anyway those for onsite

220
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
it's grand clean tool 2 it's a

221
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,480
non-working group forming buff

222
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,320
and the kind of high level goal is to

223
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,880
judge the need and scope of interest in

224
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,560
working one

225
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
or more new media delivery protocol

226
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,200
built on top of quick

227
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,320
my co-chair is alan frindle

228
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,399
so let's go a little bit into depth here

229
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,760
about what's this until next slide

230
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
so the goal here is really to look for

231
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,040
solutions for today's world

232
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
a significant reason for doing something

233
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
here is really to

234
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
anything in the new delivery protocol

235
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,240
would be due to the evolving world

236
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
cdn's

237
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,000
good security model models and

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,079
authorization

239
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,399
the fact that it's distributed systems

240
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,120
there's diverse set of clients

241
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
definitely built on top of cloud all

242
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,399
those things that you need to think

243
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,279
about

244
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,880
and maybe that your

245
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
incumbent protocols

246
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,880
maybe didn't really see when they were

247
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,240
built so next slide

248
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
and it's quick

249
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,839
and quicky is really a facilitator it

250
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,440
has a number of capabilities that are

251
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
attractive

252
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,800
multiple

253
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,880
multiplex streams

254
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,360
unreliable datagrams it's congested

255
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,959
controlled

256
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,279
it has a good reasonably good security

257
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,760
with tls point-to-point

258
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,639
flexibility and reality reliability all

259
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,240
the way between full

260
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,160
and partial

261
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,199
basically a single shot datagrams

262
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,959
you have

263
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,600
path migration to support

264
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,480
clients moving between networks

265
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,160
you have user space implementation

266
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,120
making it fairly easy to deploy

267
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,199
uh so

268
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,720
building on this can simplify the

269
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,040
protocol and improve the possibilities

270
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,120
to deploy so

271
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,680
uh next slide

272
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,600
so the big question for the buff is

273
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,959
gonna be

274
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,279
what to tackle and it's

275
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,480
it's a fairly

276
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,680
i mean

277
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,959
big range here from and one of the major

278
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,680
factors here is probably latency

279
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,480
from quite short latencies to

280
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,199
usually gaming remote desktoping and

281
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,240
telephony video conferencing requires

282
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,040
to

283
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,720
live media

284
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,480
it's still very wide range from maybe

285
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,279
just some seconds to

286
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,800
10 seconds

287
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,440
and we have on-demand media

288
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,279
yes personal observation here is

289
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,120
probably the on-demand media is not

290
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
targeted to this

291
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,079
but um

292
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,920
i'm just rather questioning of

293
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,959
how much of the above we need to tackle

294
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,839
uh next slide

295
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,480
so live media is probably a starting

296
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,600
point

297
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,440
and there's interesting things here

298
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,199
around this this is

299
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,519
pictures i got from james gruesing who's

300
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,199
going to present to the boss but it's

301
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,320
looking at

302
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
typical kind of

303
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,759
basic case

304
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,480
of

305
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,920
a tv

306
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,000
production chain for light tv all the

307
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
way over to distribution both on demand

308
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,880
over

309
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,040
satellite terrestrial networks

310
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
and those bigger arrows are what's maybe

311
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,560
interest here and what's related so

312
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,399
we have three different ingest arrows

313
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,320
and they all are different colors for

314
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,440
reason

315
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
because there's some subtle differences

316
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,279
here and requirements

317
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,519
syndication

318
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,199
it's a

319
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,600
can't be either distribution or in guest

320
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,839
or it's something around there

321
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,959
also slightly different requirements

322
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,040
the content delivery

323
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,279
with this streaming arrow there getting

324
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,279
the media out

325
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,519
that's different

326
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,120
yet another set of requirements that's

327
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
different

328
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,000
so

329
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,279
um next slide

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
on top of this we also have these kind

331
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
of hybrid use cases

332
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,480
so

333
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,959
what's it does exist beyond this

334
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,399
evolving the classical use case

335
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,399
improving them

336
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,880
so i call it hybrid because it's

337
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,959
use cases because it's combining aspects

338
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,959
of several use cases

339
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,280
i think a fairly straightforward example

340
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
here

341
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
is corporate all employee meetings

342
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,720
requesting answers

343
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
you have the the big guys up there

344
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,280
speaking speaking speaking

345
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,400
and then you get the questions and

346
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,679
answers

347
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,599
and suddenly someone

348
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,880
okay

349
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,640
you want to ask a question and you want

350
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,199
to actually let them ask live

351
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,319
easily

352
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,679
without any

353
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
kind of like i mean we notice here let

354
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,440
me take when you add some there's a

355
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,400
short powers etc can we get something

356
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,039
that works without any kind of clear

357
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,039
change

358
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,919
so

359
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,440
that's the case i think where live media

360
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,640
delivery meets video conferencing

361
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,720
so there are more use cases like this

362
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,200
nature i think the existence

363
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,440
but

364
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,679
it's both positives

365
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,480
does it get us a more useful solution

366
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,039
is it more long-term evolvable

367
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,679
but can we do this without

368
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,679
boiling the ocean

369
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,679
is it something we can

370
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,080
find the right scope to get a good start

371
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
deliver something initially

372
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,280
evolved

373
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,880
it's all questions

374
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,760
so

375
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,320
next slide

376
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,039
so

377
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,760
noob

378
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,559
slides it's not

379
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,600
yeah

380
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
so it's a lot of questions for this buff

381
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,480
but um if you want to prepare

382
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,320
you could take a look at some of these

383
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,400
documents that have some inputs or

384
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,440
proposals etc or things that been done

385
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,120
to maybe better understand where people

386
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
are coming from

387
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,880
so

388
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,250
um

389
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,400
[Music]

390
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,360
yep

391
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,799
take care

392
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,559
i don't have that much more i think it's

393
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,760
you're welcome to counter buff on

394
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,840
wednesday morning

395
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,760
and have prepared with your questions

396
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,919
etc follow along the discussion

397
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,720
contribute with what's your

398
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,360
views etc so

399
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,720
yeah you can take the next slide but

400
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
um so

401
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,559
any questions from in these sessions

402
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,919
about the buff

403
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,600
not trying to hold the warfare but if

404
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
there's any

405
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,799
questions or things that you should

406
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,280
think about

407
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
yeah if you want to get in the queue

408
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,480
please raise your hand

409
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,640
in

410
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,160
great

411
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
then you can stand up and say

412
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,960
um

413
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,919
sanjay mishra yeah um on your very first

414
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,320
slide you had uh cdn

415
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,520
um

416
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,120
acknowledgement so

417
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
i know you you were short here you know

418
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,480
yeah yeah i'm sure

419
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,400
yes and i don't know if it's like it's

420
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,440
it's

421
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,840
cdns are there they're a part of a lot

422
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,919
of the media delivery

423
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,880
and i i think it's it's

424
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,280
our protocol maybe not acknowledge them

425
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
but if you're actually looking at system

426
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,840
wide view you usually need something how

427
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,760
do you deal with a fan out who's this

428
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,840
part of the fan out it's affecting

429
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
security and things like that about what

430
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,159
security mode can you have with a cdn

431
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,600
going through those

432
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
having multiple cdns because if you're

433
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,280
large enough

434
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,120
a single cdn is not enough you probably

435
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,280
have severals et cetera those kind of

436
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,200
questions these are things we need to

437
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,480
consider so

438
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,640
yeah

439
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
glenn

440
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,600
hey there sorry i couldn't be there in

441
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,120
person um

442
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,080
so

443
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,000
one of the interesting use cases that i

444
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,440
don't see on your list that you might

445
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
want to consider if in fact this does

446
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,039
become a working group or the work gets

447
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,720
taken up someplace

448
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,919
is the situations in which you end up

449
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,200
having because of your immediate

450
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,480
workflows

451
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
and the practical reality of who's going

452
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,559
to support quick and who might not um

453
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,559
there's a case where you have to do

454
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,559
transitions along the media workflow

455
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,960
potentially from quick to some other

456
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,039
transport back to quick even

457
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,159
um and those transition points may be

458
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,640
areas of either like a best practices

459
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,880
document or even maybe some innovation

460
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
around the quick space

461
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
um around those transitions between

462
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,559
protocols it's just the reality of

463
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,200
complex media flows that you end up with

464
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,840
um these like you know islands of things

465
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,440
that don't support the latest and

466
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,960
greatest and you have to sort of

467
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,400
transition in and out kind of like you

468
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,960
know six before back in the in in in

469
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,159
that other world

470
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,520
so just

471
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,120
that one comment the other thing is an

472
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,039
excellent consideration come to the buff

473
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,360
and tell it there

474
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,520
your your timing could be worse 10 a.m

475
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,360
cet when you live in california it's

476
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,320
pretty painful i'll try we'll see

477
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,919
no promises

478
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,919
yeah the other thing i'll highlight here

479
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,880
and then you may want to take back to

480
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,039
your boss but i'll talk about in the sva

481
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,440
slides that are coming up next is the

482
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,280
streaming video alliance is is putting

483
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,640
together a quick uh streaming plc

484
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,960
uh not to sort of do a bake off of the

485
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,760
the quick protocol but to really build a

486
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,240
test environment for media operators who

487
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
want to understand quick and evaluate

488
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,000
against their current operating

489
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,840
environment and understand what what it

490
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,559
means so just a point over to that and

491
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,159
it may be relevant work to the stuff you

492
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,600
guys are doing in mock

493
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
okay thank you

494
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,840
so much

495
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
mo

496
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,640
uh mozinha just to chime in on the point

497
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,240
about cdns two of the drafts uh going

498
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,679
into the buff

499
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,480
the quicker drafts do explicitly mention

500
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,919
uh relay nodes

501
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,200
they don't think they call them cdns and

502
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,360
such but it essentially is a cdn so they

503
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,200
have an explicit uh provision in the

504
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,280
protocol for those relay nodes their

505
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,039
function and how they handle

506
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,600
publications and subscriptions

507
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,280
so you want to take a look at that yep

508
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
okay thank you

509
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,760
so

510
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,280
i think we're done here

511
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,320
oh no sonia

512
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,480
sanjay misha a real quick question again

513
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
to mo um you mentioned uh see a couple

514

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,600
all right

539
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,480

and i'm going to give another one of our

544
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,960
uh updates uh on the streaming video

545
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,279
alliance there's obviously a

546
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,200
considerable overlap

547
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,480
between the interests of the streaming

548
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
video alliance participants

549
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,679
uh and the itf so we've been doing these

550
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,200
updates now for quite a while in mops

551
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,559
in fact even three months uh and uh just

552
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,799
for your knowledge i tend to do these

553
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,320
updates the other direction too over to

554
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,480
the student video line so they are aware

555
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,559
of what the ietf is up to

556
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,840
next slide please

557
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,279
uh so for those of you who are not

558
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,159
familiar with the good old sva um there

559
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,240
is about 100 members now these are

560
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,320
people that tend to focus on

561
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,720
uh the actual practice of delivering

562
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,880
streamed video to people's houses

563
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,799
uh you know they the people who

564
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,240
participate are content studios

565
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,919
streaming services

566
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,799
technology providers and cdn operators

567
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,960
um there's a very strong intersection

568
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,840
between both these topics and the ietf

569
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,000
but also participants a number of people

570
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
even in this working session such as

571
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,279
sanjay um are also uh very active over

572
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,600
in the stream of video alliance as

573
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,760
myself and and leslie as well uh so um

574
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,120
if you if you want to sort of position

575
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,640
what the sva does

576
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,159
it's a little bit like uh like an

577
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
operator's group like nano uh would be

578
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,720
to the itf for protocols

579
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,039
not exact match but pretty close and the

580
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,320
working groups that the it or the sba uh

581
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,640
focuses on are the ones listed right

582
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,200
there um in particular to the itf are

583
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,720
things like live streaming and open

584
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,360
caching uh which have direct tiebacks to

585
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,919
the itf as well as a group i chair the

586
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,600
networking transport group which is

587
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,000
where the quick dlc is being done uh we

588
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,720
also do vr work uh players and playback

589
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
and privacy and protection uh measuring

590
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,240
qe all the kind of good stuff that

591
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,559
relates to taking video and delivering

592
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,600
it over the open internet to customers

593
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,320
next slide please

594
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,279
uh just so you're aware as i pointed out

595
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,880
a few of us are around so if you want to

596
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,200

build bridges next slide please

603
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,880
so let's talk about a few things that

604
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
have come out since we did the last

605
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,760
update um

606
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,440
last update i talked a little bit about

607
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,520
the open caching api

608
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,240
uh becoming available uh it was sort of

609
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,320
early release then it is actually full

610
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,440
release now um there is a url down there

611
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,679
at the bottom and this open caching

612
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,400
testbed is you know one of the key

613
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,200
things the sva has been producing

614
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,000
is an open caching specification uh and

615
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,720
the the apis and we have a lot of people

616
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,039
in that room who are building the thing

617
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,399
and deploying it

618
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,200
and so one of the obviously one of the

619
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,679
important things is interoperability and

620
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,080
the uses apis and testing of them so

621
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,240
that we've stood up a service now uh

622
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,840
where you can actually go in and test

623
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,440
your apis against a reference testbed

624
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,240
and

625
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,320
uh to verify that they're up and working

626
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,600
and doing the thing they're supposed to

627
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,559
do

628
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,840
next slide please

629
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,200
uh i also want to point out some open

630
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,880
caching configuration interface

631
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,120
specifications that came out uh

632
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,000
uh officially back in the beginning of

633
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,240
march there is three sets of them on

634
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,440
overview architecture uh a extension for

635
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,720
the cdni that's the itf cdni uh metadata

636
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,640
object model and the publishing layers

637
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,000
apis

638
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,440
and i also point you if you're

639
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,120
interested in these things uh go over

640
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,520
and look at the itf and you'll see or

641
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,000
sorry cdni at the itf uh mailing list

642
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,080
you'll see like uh documents and stuff

643
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,520
that have flown over from sva to the itf

644
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,760
around cdni and these specifications so

645
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,679
there's a strong linkage there for us

646
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,480
next slide please

647
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,440
uh there's another paper i wanted to

648
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
point out to you this is a fairly long

649
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
uh white paper that the sva recently

650
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,039
published it's around 5g edge cloud

651
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:43,840
and

652
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,480
it you know given the work the yes the

653
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,120
itf has done around um you know network

654
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,279
slicing and other things like that i

655
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,720
think there's a lot of internets here

656
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,880
that the itf community would find

657
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,520
interesting to read uh it's about 110

658
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,480
pages fairly long uh and we try to

659
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,440
balance between a little bit of

660
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,520
marketing not a lot of marketing really

661
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,360
and technology without getting down to

662
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,760
the leads so it really should appeal to

663
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,159
the itf reader of this white paper next

664
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,720
slide please

665
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,000
so i mentioned this uh when magnus was

666
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,880
talking um one of the things you know

667
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,320
we've been looking at from an operating

668
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,640
perspective for delivering video is you

669
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,720
know everyone's talking about quick

670
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
and from the itf perspective sometimes

671
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
you know quick is like hey we shipped it

672
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,080
it's ready to go

673
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,399
from the adopter perspective it's still

674
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,120
early days in some cases and so

675
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,279
one of the questions that a lot of uh

676
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,679
implementers uh and users of quick in

677
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,159
their media workflows have said is well

678
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,520
this looks interesting but it's a pretty

679
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,240
big change for us it's shifting from the

680
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,120
world we know which is tcp based and all

681
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,960
the optimizations we do there and all

682
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,520
the uh you know tools we have for

683
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,520
end-to-end monitoring and and problem

684
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,240
fixing and detection those all change

685
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,480
what changes in my workflow

686
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,640
and so one of the things the uh sva is

687
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,320
doing is producing a

688
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,360
a testing poc uh that effectively is

689
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,960
working to produce a sort of end-to-end

690
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,039
reference evaluation

691
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,520
architecture that would allow anybody

692
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,360
who wants to evaluate quick or

693
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,679
deployment in their media workflow to

694
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,840
take that along with instrumentation

695
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,000
recommendations and proof of concepts

696
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
how you would do that in players and on

697
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,120
servers and build that reference and

698
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,159
document it sort of test implementation

699
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,799
for your company or your organization to

700
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,799
be able to uh use quick and do a

701
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,640
meaningful evaluation of how it fits

702
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,559
into your workflow this is not meant to

703
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,080
be a you know quick versus hgb2 it's not

704
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,960
you know

705
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,880
meant as like this is better this is

706
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,640
better than that other one it really is

707
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,200
an ability for organizations who want to

708
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,360
adopt quick to understand the impacts

709
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,799
and evaluate it

710
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,120
and so reference testing infrastructure

711
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,559
is something a lot of people identify

712
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,919
and so something we're working on right

713
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,480
now to produce and publish

714
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,279
next slide please

715
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,200
and finally if you want to get in

716
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,279
contact uh about any of these mentioned

717
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,279
projects or slides or just information

718
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,360
in general uh here's some contact points

719
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,200
you can reach out to myself

720
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,440
uh sanjay as i mentioned uh there's also

721
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,000
uh jason thibodeau who uh is the

722
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,720
executive director over at the sba uh

723
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
and he can uh you know help point you

724
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,399
and put you in contact with the right

725
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,399
working groups uh and or tell you about

726
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,159
what's coming up from the group

727
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,360
and with i'll take questions

728
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,519
thanks glenn so

729
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,279
any questions in the room or online

730
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,399
amber hands up and meet echo

731
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,960
i think he must have explained it all

732
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,799
very very clearly glenn

733
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,840
awesome

thank you

737
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,480
all right

738
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,480
um moving right along next up is julia

739
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,880
kenyon

740
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,240
who i think is online

741
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,240
yes

742

alrighty um

743
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,240
and i assume i am sharing the slides

744
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,320
right go ahead julia

745
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,480
all right

746
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,600
video

747
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,279
hello

748
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,840
um hi i'm julia kenyon i work for a

749
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
company called uh phoenix rts if you've

750
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,919
never heard of us that's not surprising

751
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,279
um we do

752
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,840
streaming using webrtc

753
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,080
and we've had a lot of use cases that

754
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,720
intersected with dash over the years so

755
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,159
last may

756
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,880
a bunch of colleagues

757
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,559
joined dash i f to talk about

758
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,440
what kind of use cases we could support

759
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,799
if we were to

760
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,600
kind of integrate dash webrtc

761
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,840
so if you pull up the next

762
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
slide uh so

763
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,960
there's a number of different use cases

764
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,880
you can get from integrating dash and

765
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,159
webrtc

766
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,559
one is fall back from weber completed

767
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,480
dash so if the device doesn't support

768
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,840
webrtc

769
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,279
if the network connection isn't good

770
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,000
enough to sustain webrtc and you have to

771
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,640
do more buffering like support

772
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,919
um or if someone's offering a real-time

773
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,279
experience that's premium and someone's

774
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,039
not paying for it they can call back to

775
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,919
the higher latency hash stream

776
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,919
there's also

777
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,600
use cases where

778
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,919
you use content that's interleaved so

779
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,000
you have real-time webrtc and then you

780
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,519
interleave that with dash so you're

781
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,960
switching back and forth between

782
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,559
dashboard rotc

783
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,559
for ad period

784
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,360
or

785
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,720
uh

786
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,640
say pre-recorded content like a movie

787
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
and then interactive periods where you

788
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,480
talk to and we use director stuff like

789
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,600
that

790
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,879
or you could have content that's

791
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,960
concurrent which would be

792
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,679
uh overlaid pre-recorded ads

793
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,839
for pre-recorded dash content with

794
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,119
supplemental live web rtc streams or a

795
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,960
lot of co-watching experiences that

796
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,119
people think are really cool because

797
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,879
then you can you know interact with

798
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,320
friends that maybe are elsewhere

799
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,520
not that we would ever need to do that

800
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,480
for any reason whatsoever

801
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,520
um side face

802
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,239
so just real quick in case anybody's not

803
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,800
familiar with webrtc uh coach everyone

804
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,918
knows dash

805
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,560
where dash uses mpd which has

806
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,839
content

807
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,199
descriptions for everything that's

808
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,239
available and is the same for all users

809
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,280
webrtc uses the sdp which is unique for

810
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,599
each client and typically only describes

811
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,720
one audio in one video

812
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,960
in dash where the client selects the

813
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,560
media and the bit rate in the codecs

814
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,800
webrtc

815
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,960
just negotiates the codex to the server

816
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,480
and client and the server is what's

817
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,800
adapting the bitrate

818
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,119
in dash subtitles and captions are

819
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,800
standardized whereas webrtc all

820
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,920
implementations currently are

821
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,599
proprietary

822
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,320
uh dash uses buffered and time synced

823
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,400
timing whereas webrtc just immediately

824
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,079
renders everything it doesn't do much

825
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,560
buffering and uh does that always adds

826
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,880
latency which is is bad

827
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,000
uh dash even for low latency dash you

828
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,920
can get down to three or five seconds uh

829
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,000
webrtc is usually less than a second

830
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,720
often less than half a second

831
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,880
uh dash distribution of course is via

832
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,400
cdn which is low cost and widely

833
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,079
available webrtc servers are more

834
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,040
boutique

835
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,880
there's using standards but they're all

836
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,720
proprietary implementations

837
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,599
and dash has first libraries whereas

838
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,320
overseas built directly into browsers so

839
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,920
most people don't even need to download

840
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,599
anything

841
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,480
uh next slide please

842
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,359
so how would that work um

843
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,680
you've got for hybrid delivery you'd

844
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,119
have a publisher publishing a live

845
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,440
content it would go up into the cloud

846
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
it's transcoded packaged

847
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,599
gets delivered as webrtc stream through

848
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,920
a scaled delivery system and to the

849
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,320
subscriber that same content can get

850
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
pushed out into a dash manifest in

851
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,800
chunks and delivered via cdn's or

852
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,560
particular recorded content can go into

853
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,680
that same

854
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,160
processor for dash which provides a

855
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,720
manifest and chats and through the cdn

856
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,079
subscribers

857
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,440
so that's

858
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,800
pretty straightforward but of course all

859
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,119
these boxes contain a lot of

860
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,400
details as you don't like that

861
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
next slide

862
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,200
and the client would be

863
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,440
more of a

864
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,839
webrtc client kind of grafted onto the

865
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,440
side of a dash player

866
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,960
so you'd get your typical dash player

867
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,200
getting mpd's and segments

868
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,280
and then that would talk via a set of

869
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,000
apis to a webrtc client which is the

870
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,240
standard stack an http client a

871
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,599
websocket

872
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,400
that then talks to the webrtc server

873
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,520
and

874
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,599
they just go back and forth using a set

875
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,320
of apis that still need to be defined

876
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,520
next slide please

877
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,240
so the workflow would look like this

878
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,040
so the dash player gets the mpd which

879
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,119
then comes back with a set of webrtc

880
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,720
adaptation sets

881
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,800
the dash player would pick out which

882
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,000
which tracks it likes so if the mpd says

883
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,240
hey there's a german track over here and

884
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,079
an english track over there it would

885
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,079
know your preferences or you'd ask you

886
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,760
and you could select one

887
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,359
it would send that information about

888
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,599
those specific streams to the webrtc

889
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,560
client

890
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,400
which then does very standard sdp

891
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,320
negotiation except that that's not

892
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,680
standard yet but we'll get to that in a

893
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,160
minute um does this does stp negotiation

894
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,480
then establishes this webrtc connection

895
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,320
establishes a websocket connection and

896
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,000
then media starts flowing from the

897
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,760
webrtc media server

898
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,520
as well as events over that website

899
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,839
next list

900
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,640
um as i kind of alluded to earlier the

901
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,400
current state of real-time streaming the

902
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,280
webrtc stream is standard but getting

903
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,560
there is not

904
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,760
so if you want to connect to a system

905
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,440
that's doing webrtc streaming you need

906
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,000
to get some kind of proprietary manifest

907
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,680
and the system to get the session

908
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,240
negotiation is also proprietary

909
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,359
so

910
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,200
you can't just take any client and

911
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,280
connect to any server you need to have a

912
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,760
bunch of stuff before you get there

913
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,960
and we would at some point soon like to

914
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,200
make those more standard so that clients

915
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,400
don't have to

916
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,920
all

917
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,720
speak the same language as their

918
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,599
specific survey

919
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,720
okay that's fine

920
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,320
so webrtc's got a lot of work to do um

921
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,440
as far as

922
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,640
uh the

923
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,480
standardization efforts

924
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,800
so a signaling protocol which is

925
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,839
currently in work as far as the the whip

926
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,119
protocol

927
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,040
um which is a bit much a bit like an atm

928
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,000
machine um

929
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,119
so

930
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,800
there needs to be a standard session

931
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,560
management protocol there needs to be

932
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,920
some kind of stream switching that

933
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
doesn't require starting over again with

934
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,760
stp negotiation

935
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,480
um there's a bunch of work around

936
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,839
time synchronization time

937
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,000
synchronization with dash

938
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,720
and collecting metrics so dash clients

939
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,560
collect a lot of good metrics that would

940
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,520
be good for webrtc sessions to also

941
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,480
collect and then translate those into

942
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,880
existing metrics and then send those via

943
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,839
the apis that were in the system diagram

944
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,560
okay next slide please

945
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,599
and

946
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,800
dash

947
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,880
needs to determine the apis that go

948
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,640
between those webrtc clients and the

949
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,400
dash clients

950
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,200
to try to define how webrtc information

951
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,079
gets presented in those mpd's

952
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,560
decide whether dash and webrtc would

953
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,240
both render to a single browser video

954
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,079
element or switch between two

955
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,720
and support hybrid operations between

956
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,598
dash and webrtc

957
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,280
i think that's the last slide

958
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,400
oh sorry

959
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,760
okay so

960
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,280
dash i have

961
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,000
worked on a report that summarized that

962
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,079
there's a summary of that report at this

963
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,040
link

964
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,400
the full report is at the other url and

965
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,720
we also have an interest survey

966
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,640
where we're trying to find out which

967
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,000
people are interested in

968
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,839
this for in furthering the standards

969
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,640
work

970
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,200
that we've defined and

971
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,000
um

972
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,640
what use cases they're interested in

973
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,480
so i would encourage everybody to at

974
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,599
least look at the summary and if you

975
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,960
even if you don't find it interesting

976
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,319
please fill out the interest survey

977
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,319
because one of the options is that

978
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,279
you're not interested at all

979
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,720
great thanks and and if you've been

980
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,480
following the chat which i'm sure you

981
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,640
were doing while you were presenting not

982
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,400
okay

983
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,920
yeah there are some suggestions that

984
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,680
this looks like it's got some good

985
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,520
overlap with with mock so hopefully

986
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,960
you'll be able to make the mop off on

987
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,160
wednesday

988
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,399
um

989
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,400
ben i think you have a question

990
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,160
yeah hi there um nice presentation julia

991
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,040
thanks

992
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
um glendon here from compass embassy

993
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,240
universal

994
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,960
uh so a couple questions uh one in this

995
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,680
sort of workflow this hybrid workflow

996
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,720
how would trip play like the ability to

997
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,119
pause rewind

998
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,960
jump back to live

999
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,880
what's the vision for that and then you

1000
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,400
want to take these individually or shall

1001
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,599
i ask them all at once

1002
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,119
well if they're all if they're all

1003
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,800
connected then i would just ask them all

1004
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
at once and then we'll we'll see which

1005
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,400
ones i remember

1006
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,040
uh and the other one was um you know the

1007
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,200
watermarking is done today

1008
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,119
through dash manifests with it with the

1009
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,960
av trick baby selection trick um any

1010
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
thought about how you do that in this

1011
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,280
world

1012
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,280
um well i'll start with trick way so

1013
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,480
keep playing the way we

1014
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,960
the way people are doing it right now is

1015
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,040
you're you're on the live edge and

1016
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
you're watching you know what happened

1017
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,560
say on the football field just a second

1018
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,160
ago and you can pick which kind of

1019
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,640
football you like uh

1020
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,400
american or real um

1021
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,560
so

1022
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,760
sorry not sorry um

1023
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,079
so you're on the live edge and

1024
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,920
something happens so you want to back up

1025
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,079
so then you

1026
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,640
have an option usually in ui to pop

1027
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,720
backwards when you go backwards you're

1028
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,319
you're then

1029
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,200
going into the dash world right so then

1030
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,640
you're in the dashboard you can scrub

1031
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,640
you can do all the usual things you can

1032
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,880
do in a recorded stream

1033
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,440
and then when you watch and see oh

1034
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
that's why that guy got a red card

1035
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
or got a flag

1036
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,000
then you can then

1037
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,240
pop back to the live edge and then

1038
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,960
you're back out of rtc

1039
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
and and so with the weber so i noticed

1040
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,240
your media flow that you at webrtc both

1041
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,800
being um packaged as a dash manifest

1042
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,720
element but also direct delivery into

1043
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,160
clients

1044
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,599
um how would the direct delivery in the

1045
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,200
clients work there they basically see a

1046
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,400
black black box of the webrtc content

1047
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,440
during the trick player

1048
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,200
this is your segregation

1049
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,319
is where i'm going with ultimately

1050
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,000
yeah and that's that's kind of one of

1051
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,800
the things that we want to work on in

1052
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,720
additional that's kind of the further

1053
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,200
work additional reading kind of

1054
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,480
thing we need to work on so

1055
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
what what we do

1056
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,200
is we'll actually just have

1057
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,400
you have a

1058
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,720
an app that just shares a window

1059
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,599
and either the webrtc client or the dash

1060
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,960
client or control that window at any

1061
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,520
given time

1062
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,880
so it's not really synchronized i guess

1063
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,760
i mean they're

1064
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,200
you're not

1065
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,560
you because you can't get the dash

1066
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,520
data

1067
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,520
there at the same time that you get the

1068
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,920
webrtc data that's you know that's kind

1069
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,520
of the whole

1070
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,800
whole thing

1071
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,400
is always going to be delayed right yeah

1072
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,920
so so an observation that we talked

1073
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,200
about what i'm working in a minute two

1074
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,520
one one question one observation one

1075
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,119
observation is potentially you might run

1076
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,880
into some um

1077
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,160
if the code rates for like the the the

1078
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,440
the the the the webrtc versus the dash

1079
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,319
content or a different uh frame rates or

1080
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,640
different uh you know different verses

1081
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,040
um you might write into like some weird

1082
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,400
interactions there that you'll have to

1083
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,160
sort of synchronize in addition to the

1084
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,520
time synchronization but the frequency

1085
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,599
synchronization

1086
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,520
um and then that's the observation the

1087
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,599
question is and why i assume you're

1088
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,720
referring to real football being

1089
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,480
canadian football

1090
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,359
when you make that comment now now

1091
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,960
no australian rules football actually

1092
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,480
but yeah okay

1093
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,200
so so and then the question about um how

1094
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,800
would you potentially do

1095
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,000
uh the watermarking uh uh

1096
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,400
at this point

1097
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,680
um

1098
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,280
at this point

1099
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,040
we don't um

1100
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,880
so that's another thing that would be

1101
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,359
good to kind of hash out as far as would

1102
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,000
you have completely separate streams or

1103
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,440
would you just say

1104
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,040
live edge we're not going to

1105
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,520
bother with that or you know do

1106
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,680
some other way of content protection and

1107
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,520
then just do the the av selection on the

1108
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,880
dash side

1109
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,760
well we use watermarking also for like

1110
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
measurement and like

1111
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,720
impact

1112
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,119
beyond content protection

1113
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,359
yeah i'm i'm familiar used to work at

1114
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,119
parents um

1115
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:09,920
yeah

1116
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
so i mean you could you could still

1117
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,440
watermark the content as it's going

1118
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,720
through

1119
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,839
for uh if you wanted to put

1120
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,880
that kind of mark in indeed right so so

1121
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,280
you're sort of i just want to kind of

1122
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,280
riverside would be the answer you do

1123
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,599
versus client side

1124
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,560
yes

1125
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,440
okay

1126
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,119
their answer

1127
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,359
thanks

1128
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,720
great and everyone can see ellie's

1129
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
comment about everyone should uh look at

1130
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,319
the report and probably do that so

1131
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,599
and i'm wondering if you guys don't have

1132
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,400
enough to read already

1133
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,880
does anybody else have a comment or a

1134
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
question to follow up either in the room

1135
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,440
or online

1136
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,400
not seeing anything in the queue

1137
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,920
i will say thank you very much julia

1138
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,240

and i think riemann is

1146

online for that

1147
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,000

uh rena did you want to present the

1149
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,800
slides yourself or shall i do it

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,680
be presenting an update to our draft

1154
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,880
uh this is a joint work with a grammar

1155
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,359
next slide please

1156
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,720
so the updates to the draft are in the

1157
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,200
abstract and the introduction we will

1158
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,200
talk about the changes in the next few

1159
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,399
slides next slide please

1160
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,720
we have got a detailed feedback in the

1161
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,000
mailing list

1162
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,760
many thanks to spencer rohit jake kiran

1163
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,240
and ali

1164
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,640
they provided both feedback and comments

1165
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,000
on the mailing list

1166
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
we have responded point by point to the

1167
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,240
feedback on the mailing list we will now

1168
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,119
discuss our proposed changes in response

1169
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,680
to the feedback

1170
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,680
exactly

1171
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,200
we propose to replace the term augmented

1172
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,079
reality with the much

1173
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,960
more broader term extended reality we

1174
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,359
believe this reflects the scope of the

1175
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,839
document more accurately

1176
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,599
we will discuss the scope in the next

1177
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,920
slide

1178
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,319
extended reality is a term that includes

1179
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,800
augmented reality virtual reality and

1180
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,640
mixed reality

1181
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,359
er combines the real and virtual is

1182
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,520
interactive and is aligned to the

1183
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,319
physical world of the user

1184
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,800
on the other hand vr places the user

1185
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,599
inside a virtual environment generated

1186
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,319
by a computer

1187
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,720
mr merges the real and virtual world

1188
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,359
along a continuum that connects

1189
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,760
completely real environment at one end

1190
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,839
to a completely virtual environment at

1191
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,400
the other

1192
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,640
in this continuum all combinations of

1193
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,040
the real and virtual are captured

1194
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,119
now let's look at our proposed scope of

1195
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,520
the document of the draft as well as the

1196
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,200
intended audience next slide please

1197
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,359
it was pointed out by the reviewers

1198
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,440
that the scope and the intended audience

1199
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,000
needs to be defined first

1200
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,079
depending on the choices made the draft

1201
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,400
can take different parts

1202
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,280
so this is our proposed scope

1203
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,359
this document explores the issues

1204
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,920
involved in the use of edge computing

1205
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,119
resources

1206
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,520
to operationalize media use cases that

1207
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,640
involve extended reality applications

1208
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,160
in particular we discussed those

1209
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,960
applications that run on devices having

1210
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,200
different form factors and need edge

1211
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,680
computing resources to mitigate the

1212
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,079
effect of problems such as a need to

1213
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,400
support interactive communication

1214
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,040
requiring low latency limited battery

1215
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,440
power and heat dissipation from these

1216
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,000
devices

1217
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,640
the proposed intended audience for this

1218
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,200
document are network operators who are

1219
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,839
interested in providing edge computing

1220
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,000
resources to operationalize the

1221
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,119
requirements of such applications

1222
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,839
next slide please

1223
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,599
so we'd like to solicit the working

1224
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,839
group's view on the proposed scope and

1225
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,839
the intended audience

1226
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,920
we welcome other pertinent issues that

1227
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,520
the working group would like to include

1228
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,880
in the draft

1229
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,520
reviewers and contributors are invited

1230
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,280
to support the draft

1231
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,440
the link to the github repo is given in

1232
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,319
that slide many thanks to kyle

1233
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,240
so with the chairs permission we'd like

1234
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,680
to open the floor for a discussion

1235
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,480
so

1236
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,599
any discussion on what has been proposed

1237
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,920
here

1238
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,480
spencer is looking for the button

1239
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,319
in the end

1240
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,598
all right spencer is in the queue

1241
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,839
this is i'm spencer dawkins and i'm

1242
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,160
really struggling with uh

1243
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,720
the first itf out of the last four or

1244
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,839
five when i have not had two 24-inch

1245
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,960
monitors to go back and forth with

1246
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,559
others here may feel the same way

1247
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,359
so thank you for this

1248
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,559
i did have one question

1249
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,160
that the

1250
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,359
scope you proposed uh

1251
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,440
seems

1252
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,200
focused well i mean it is focused on

1253
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,480
people doing

1254
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,160
whatever whatever ar is

1255
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,280
that

1256
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,760
are going to be using edge computing

1257
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,480
for things like split rendering

1258
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,680
um and i'm curious if there's anybody

1259
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,880
who

1260
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,040
is not who is going to who's going to

1261
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,200
try to be supporting ar

1262
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,760
but not using edge computing

1263
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,520
as a way to

1264
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,079
support ar and that's a

1265
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,119
question for the group of course

1266
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,319
so clarifying question spencer

1267
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,480
by not using edge computing what are you

1268
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,800
suggesting or that they'll do it in in

1269
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,920
cloud resources or yeah i mean any any

1270
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,720
other way some of which

1271
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,599
people in this room may be inventing

1272
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,280
on their laptops now

1273
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,760
uh that you know i i guess i'm kind of

1274
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,280
asking

1275
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,960
if

1276
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,480
if there are such other ways to do this

1277
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,240
do we do you know do we expect are we

1278
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,839
planning to expand this document or

1279
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,599
write another document about cl you know

1280
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,599
we're doing it through cloud or what

1281
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,599
like that and i'm like i say i'm mostly

1282
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,800
asking

1283
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,960
uh for the working group to think about

1284
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,760
this and uh

1285
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,400
i have been where

1286
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,520
um

1287
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,119
renin is uh as you know and so have

1288
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,960
aliyah and jake

1289
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,960
um as far as you know you've got to work

1290
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,400
your document and you're not getting a

1291
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,400
lot of input for it and

1292
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,720
it really it really improves the

1293
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,800
document when when the rest of the

1294
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
working group is paying attention

1295
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,040
so like i say i'm i'm

1296
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,480
not asking

1297
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,400
the authors to make me happy

1298
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,839
i'm asking the authors to make the

1299
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,440
working group happy right

1300
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,920
reena do you have any thoughts to share

1301
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,119
or yeah uh i think um

1302
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,640
the use of edge computing essentially

1303
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,200
comes into play when you are talking of

1304
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,520
uh offloading computationally intensive

1305
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,880
stuff

1306
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,760
which

1307
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,599
might result in

1308
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,359
heated equipment

1309
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,280
or

1310
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,119
limited battery capacity so the battery

1311
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,240
runs out

1312
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,599
uh in addition to your standard

1313
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,640
requirement for uh very low latency

1314
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,559
in such applications

1315
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,319
so what we

1316
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,040
see uh going forward is that the edge

1317
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,319
computing

1318
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,280
uh

1319
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,400
solution is an overarching umbrella

1320
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,319
under which other possible things can

1321
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,000
also be added to

1322
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,680
uh so i've had discussions with people

1323
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,280
who suggested uh

1324
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,359
things like uh multipath uh dcp

1325
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,520
uh just you know just throwing that

1326
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,720
to the working group uh but we we do

1327
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,880
feel that edge computing has this uh uh

1328
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,480
umbrella umbrella-like property where

1329
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,280
you

1330
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,200
you can do a lot of things

1331
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,000
uh

1332
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,359
once you have solved the problem of uh

1333
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,319
uh of highly computationally intensive

1334
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,960
uh applications running on your device

1335
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,640
and you have just offloaded it to a

1336
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,200
nearby set of edge servers

1337
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,760
and then you can use all sorts of clever

1338
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,480
tricks including adaptive bitrate

1339
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,440
algorithms to further mitigate the the

1340
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,359
problem so we do feel that edge

1341
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,240
computing is is is the key thing but i'd

1342
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,000
like to hear other people as well

1343
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,720
yep i'm i'm scanning around to see if

1344
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,240
other people have comments to make on

1345
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,280
that

1346
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,440
and it looks like jake does

1347
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,079
go ahead jake

1348
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:10,880
there we go

1349
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,559
wrong buttons

1350
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,960
uh okay so

1351
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,960
it i thought

1352
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,599
our remit was more about media and less

1353
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,440
about edge compute there's like the coin

1354
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,480
rg work uh research group

1355
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,200
that's doing some work on edge compute

1356
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,880
are you

1357
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,839
looking there to refine uh

1358
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,839
edge compute use cases

1359
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,240
if that's the sort of direction

1360
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,880
you think is is right to be headed

1361
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,559
so i i thought the question was slightly

1362
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,319
different i thought and and i could be

1363
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,920
way out of line here but i thought it

1364
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,839
was more that because because the

1365
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,000
computing is being offloaded to the edge

1366
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,440
there are different

1367
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,359
media delivery expectations and

1368
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,880
requirements

1369
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,720
um than there would be if it wasn't

1370
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,200
being done on edge computing not

1371
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,000
not the question of you know how to do

1372
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,839
the computing there which i think would

1373
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,119
be the purview of a different group

1374
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,920
yeah okay

1375
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,920
could be and and then spencer's question

1376
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,559
was if you weren't doing it at

1377
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,119
said edge device but we're doing it

1378
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,200
somewhere else like in the cloud and

1379
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,559
he's going to come and explain to us

1380
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,520
where

1381
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,400
uh

1382
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,160
then the delivery requirements might be

1383
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,160
different and therefore

1384
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,599
would they be covered in this document

1385
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:26,960
or would that be managed in a different

1386
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,359
document

1387
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,880
spencer wanted to follow up

1388
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,400
thanks um yeah spencer talkings again

1389
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,319
the um

1390
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,480
so the thing i'm wondering about

1391
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,040
is whether

1392
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,040
so coin rg is a great research group but

1393
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,559
it's a research group

1394
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,040
uh they can't they're not chartered to

1395
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,400
produce itf standards among other things

1396
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,280
um

1397
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,160
so i guess my question here is

1398
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,160
um

1399
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,280
do we

1400
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,640
it you know are we talking about

1401
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,720
engineering here

1402
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,599
or are we talking about research

1403
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:10,960
and

1404
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,760
even if we're talking about engineering

1405
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,640
this is an ops working group which is an

1406
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,160
odd place to

1407
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,200
talk about the engineering stuff

1408
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,799
many of the comments that i had on this

1409
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,960
draft uh versus previous versions of

1410
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,160
this draft

1411
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,640
were not arguing with the draft uh was

1412
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,839
more like

1413
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,079
are we sure that we've you know got this

1414
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,079
draft

1415
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,079
these draft this draft contents pointed

1416
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,920
to the right research group

1417
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,599
i note that uh

1418
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,240
mops is

1419
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,839
also chartered correct me if i'm wrong

1420
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,559
but moffs is also chartered to provide

1421
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,799
input to protocol working groups about

1422
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,240
gaps and protocols and things like that

1423
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,640
i wonder if we're not

1424
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,079
looking at a

1425
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,520
situation where that's the case here

1426
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,400
because

1427
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,920
if we're

1428
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,280
if we're pointing you know if we're

1429
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,000
pointing to a research group as

1430
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,720
the best sort of input that we've got

1431
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,640
that kind of that kind of makes me

1432
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,960
wonder if it's not if this is

1433
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,520
really engineering or if it's research

1434
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,720
eric

1435
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,680
you're going and spencer you may

1436
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,000
discover something indeed

1437
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,319
so to be honest i need to read the draft

1438
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,359
and the changes and the charter

1439
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:40,559
but it's something we need to pay

1440
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,640
attention to that's a given thank you

1441
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,799
for this

1442
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,879
so

1443
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,040
i i certainly agree that if we're off

1444
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,720
into that kind of research space we

1445
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,119
should revisit um but i'm i'm also

1446
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,359
smelling

1447
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,920
potential rat smells as in we might have

1448
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,520
fallen down a rat hole

1449
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,119
um

1450
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,559
i've pulled up the document and i i i

1451
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,079
would have to reread it again with that

1452
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,480
lens as well but i think that the i

1453
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,920
think that we are

1454
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,640
focusing on the xr side of it and not on

1455
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,079
the

1456
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,680
what's actually pertinent here which is

1457
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,559
the media challenges given that the the

1458
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,040
computing isn't being done on the device

1459
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,280
right so you're creating and i'm

1460
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,799
i'm looking at the screen i'm sure that

1461
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,280
that doesn't help bring it at all but

1462
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,720
but the

1463
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,720
it's only so virtual the

1464
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,319
the fact that you are

1465
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:39,599
trying to create this immersive

1466
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,200
environment and aren't doing the compute

1467
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,559
local does create a different cloud of

1468
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:45,760
realities

1469
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,359
for streaming the media and i think

1470
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,599
that's the area of focus

1471
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,079
and interest here

1472
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,680
renin does that sound at all like the

1473
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,960
document that you wrote uh yeah

1474
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,599
absolutely so um

1475
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,440
when we talk of operational requirements

1476
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,440
i would include things like how many

1477
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,200
edge servers do you need for example to

1478
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,559
support some use case

1479
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,040
and what are the kinds of

1480
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,880
uh

1481
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,599
protocols that you might use to to

1482
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,240
support those use cases and uh what are

1483
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,960
the limitations of those protocols

1484
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,920
so

1485
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,119
these all

1486
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,839
these all questions arise when you start

1487
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,920
to think about operationalizing

1488
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,760
uh use cases such as the one that we

1489
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,880
have presented

1490
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,839
right

1491
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,400
thank you uh i see colin in the queue

1492
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,319
and i see that spencer would like suhas

1493
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:39,040
nanda kumar to be in the queue

1494
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,440
colin

1495
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,680
yeah i mean i i think this document sort

1496
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,079
of is operational i mean i i view it i

1497
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,160
don't you know edge compute and cloud

1498
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,839
compute really all you're talking about

1499
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:50,960
i mean as far as this document's

1500
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,640
concerned it's compute and it has a

1501
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,079
different latency going to it you're

1502
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,559
talking about the operational latencies

1503
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,720
of where you put your compute um how

1504
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,119
much latency there is to that point

1505
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,640
and that's not related to anything

1506
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,079
that's going on coin rg or anything it's

1507
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:05,200
just like yeah there's going to be some

1508
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,160
compute and it can be different

1509
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,640
latencies away and we can use that to

1510
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,960
trade off against things like power and

1511
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,960
heat on headsets and you know whatever

1512
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,240
that all seems very reasonable to me it

1513
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,240
seems to be in in the scope of what

1514
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,959
we're talking about here

1515
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,640
thank you colin

1516
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,559
and i see suha says join the queue

1517
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,480
please go ahead

1518
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,119
can you hear me yes

1519
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,000
yes

1520
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,559
i cannot say no to sensors right here um

1521
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,680
i i just wanted to run on to look at the

1522
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,160
computer compute our networking box

1523
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,520
which kind of

1524
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,039
captures

1525
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:40,720
its computing and what how can you kind

1526
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,039
of offload some of the work to the edge

1527
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,799
nodes might be used something useful

1528
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,240
there not sure

1529
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,319
thought of sharing the thought thank you

1530
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,319
for the pointer and if my memory serves

1531
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,000
and it probably doesn't that's on

1532
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,240
wednesday of this week

1533
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,520
see told you my memory was suspect

1534
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,880
great thank you all right spencer you're

1535
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,200
in queue

1536
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,119
so i'm not going to check the agenda

1537
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,119
before that will and leslie's memory

1538
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,839
this is this is spencer again

1539
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:25,680
the thing for me i think is

1540
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,279
looking at the draft contents

1541
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,920
most of the things past the introduction

1542
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,920
haven't changed a lot

1543
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,039
and

1544
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,559
there's a

1545
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,160
very interesting description of why

1546
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,119
latency of targets are tied with

1547
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,359
ar

1548
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:48,079
and then there's an uh

1549
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,799
there's a description of

1550
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:54,079
the eotcp considerations which

1551
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,599
what it says isn't wrong but

1552
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,520
you know if you're doing ar over tcp

1553
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,280
that's you're going to bump into a lot

1554
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,880
of buildings

1555
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,760
um

1556
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,160
but for us to to for us to really think

1557
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,520
seriously

1558
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,559
about

1559
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,880
um

1560
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,440
what's needed here

1561
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,760
and i i take cullen's point that there

1562
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,359
are people in the world who do this

1563
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,799
every day

1564
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:20,000
um

1565
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,160
so

1566
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,240
i have no doubt that there is

1567
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,720
engineering work to do here

1568
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,640
um and that

1569
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,240
if you stood in the right place and

1570
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,920
squinted hard enough

1571
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,039
it would be

1572
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,359
operational engineering

1573
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:36,880
work to do here

1574
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,400
uh but like i said i just i'd like to

1575
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,760
have us

1576
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,760
have a really good sense

1577
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,760
of what what the right scope is for the

1578
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,520
working group document

1579
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,440
before we do a lot more wordsmithing

1580
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,559
while we're still talking about the

1581
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,839
scope does that make sense yeah so um

1582
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,559
and and a side note um you your memory

1583
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,400
your memory wins i just looked it up if

1584
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,480
the can buff is tomorrow

1585
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,820
that will not happen again

1586
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,839
[Laughter]

1587
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:10,079
um but the so to the point about scoping

1588
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,839
i think we are fairly clear on scope and

1589
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,680
i think the challenge is determining how

1590
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,119
to make sure that the document stays

1591
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,400
within scope

1592
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,760
um and

1593
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,640
the big move between the last ietf

1594
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,480
meeting in this ietf meeting was the

1595
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,319
move to get this into github so that we

1596
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,119
can pursue it more

1597
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,799
methodically

1598
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,359
so um i'm pretty sure that renan would

1599
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:32,880
appreciate some help in going through

1600
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,520
and identifying sort of which areas

1601
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,039
align well with

1602
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,039
um the scope that we've agreed which is

1603
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,599
media delivery in on operational sense

1604
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,599
um in which areas maybe are a little

1605
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:44,880
less

1606
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,599
directly related to work in this group

1607
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,280
so wait for it

1608
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,000
volunteers

1609
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,400
and spencer's looking around the room

1610
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,440
too

1611
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,079
well like uh but but you you're at a

1612
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,079
you're you're in a computer so you could

1613
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:00,960
actually

1614
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,839
stare meaningfully

1615
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:07,680
at the people who are remote

1616
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:09,520
i'm

1617
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,880
willing to

1618
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,520
help with this but i think the i think

1619
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,520
the really important thing for the for

1620
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,400
working group contributors which is more

1621
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,599
than

1622
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,119
me

1623
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,160
to

1624
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,760
be writing

1625
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,799
issues

1626
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,400
rather than prs at this point right

1627
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,440
and i think i think that

1628
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,839
we should applaud kyle for setting up

1629
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,440
the repo for

1630
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,760
this draft and uh we should do the right

1631
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,440
thing after that

1632
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,119
yep and and

1633
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,599
certainly fair point about um

1634
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,920
i can see the list of people in the room

1635
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,520
um because

1636
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,960
i mean

1637
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,480
one of the challenges as we've been

1638
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,839
working in this

1639
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,599
mostly remote mode

1640
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,200
has been

1641
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,920
really getting that sort of cycle of

1642
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,400
motion going so i'm a little concerned

1643
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,599
that we'll walk out of the meeting room

1644
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,000
today agreeing on what needs to happen

1645
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,039
here and then we'll have the same

1646
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,400
discussion

1647
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,680
in a few months

1648
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,440
in philadelphia or remotely in

1649
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,599
philadelphia um

1650
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,599
so i really like to make sure that we

1651
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,280
agree having agreed that this is a

1652
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,640
working group document and that there is

1653
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,319
working group work to do here let us do

1654
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,000
some working group work here

1655
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,760
um and if the right thing is to say

1656
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,680
right for the next month and i would say

1657
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,280
it's the next month not the month before

1658
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,599
the july meeting for the month following

1659
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,760
this meeting let's focus on identifying

1660
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,000
issues and making sure that we can

1661
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,240
get this document to line up with with

1662
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,359
you know

1663
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,119
we know it needs to be covered in order

1664
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,960
for this document to be useful and

1665
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,119
aligned well with our working group

1666
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:42,559
charter then i think that would be

1667
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,960
helpful

1668
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:46,640
and maybe

1669
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,520
having a side

1670
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,880
sidebar conversation with jake while

1671
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,280
everybody else is listening but jake was

1672
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,680
talking about the difference between uh

1673
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,119
media delivery

1674
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,280
and what it takes to do media delivery i

1675
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,000
think that i think that was his point

1676
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,079
uh in his statement

1677
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,039
and uh for us to i would suggest that

1678
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,799
that was a

1679
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,599
really useful

1680
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,799
filter for us to

1681
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,399
use to think about

1682
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,319
what we should be doing

1683
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,279
thank you

1684
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,279
oh thank you

1685
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,960
let me jump in to clarify then um

1686
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,679
yeah

1687
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,439
i was i was stalling so you'd have time

1688
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,519
to

1689
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,440
yeah sometimes the buttons are tricky um

1690
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,640
so i i i take the point i think they're

1691
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,439
i think

1692
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:42,560
uh what colin said is is right there is

1693
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,920
some uh

1694
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,799
you know

1695
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:48,158
some good ops work to do here i guess i

1696
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,158
would

1697
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:50,960
so

1698
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,479
one question is like

1699
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:55,198
how central is the compute

1700
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,319
uh offload to this but another

1701
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,679
maybe way to focus here is to like

1702
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:02,960
think that it

1703
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,000
it

1704
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,319
presumably there is some component that

1705
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,040
that's there and to talk about like

1706
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,880
uh what are the

1707
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,000
kind of bandwidth and uh latency and

1708
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,080
reliability requirements around that i

1709
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,520
think would be

1710
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,198
the kind of useful

1711
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,880
direction to flush out

1712
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,679
like what you know if you tried to run a

1713
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,439
system like this then

1714
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,640
what kind of network are you going to

1715
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,759
need

1716
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:30,560
you know and can wi-fi do it and

1717
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,238
like how many

1718
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:34,479
how many

1719
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:36,000
you know how what are the scaling

1720
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,679
considerations i guess

1721
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:38,960
as well because

1722
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,920
you know

1723
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,238
i imagine this museum tour that you've

1724
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,679
written about

1725
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,799
uh

1726
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,960
you know if you try to bring 100 people

1727
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,679
instead of 15 people then

1728
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:50,719
you know

1729
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,319
what's that going to do your to your

1730
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,360
wi-fi and or is it even wi-fi i don't

1731
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,120
i'm not i'm not really sure

1732
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,880
what the state of the art is here so i'd

1733
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,800
love to see more

1734
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,800
about that in the doc and kind of what

1735
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,640
can be achieved with what

1736
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,239
with what kind of parameters at a

1737
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,480
quantitative level i guess

1738
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,280
um

1739
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,360
do you need me to put that in a github

1740
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,040
issue or can you take care of that

1741
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,560
i tell you what if you could capture

1742
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,719
some of that in the meeting minutes it

1743
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,159
would be most helpful because i think

1744
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,400
those are good broad level questions to

1745
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,480
use as sort of a

1746
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,960
a review set of questions going through

1747
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,159
this document

1748
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,520
so it's not just

1749
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,960
to answer your questions but i think

1750
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,480
it's it's they're a good set of

1751
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,719
questions sorry kyle go ahead oh no i

1752
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,080
was just gonna say i think it's probably

1753
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,679
worthwhile to put it in a github issue

1754
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,120
as well just so it doesn't get dropped

1755
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,080
sure

1756
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,000
all right

1757
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,159
so i think that was a helpful discussion

1758
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,000
and some helpful pointers to where from

1759
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:54,960
here

1760
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,400
anything else you would like to get out

1761
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,880
of today's session

1762
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,560
uh now i would like to thank everyone

1763
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,960
for participating in the discussion

1764
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,320
uh and

1765
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,320
just wanted to reiterate that we for

1766
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,480
this iteration we only focused on the

1767
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,239
abstract and the introduction because

1768
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:12,960
you think it's it's really important to

1769
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,560
fix the scope

1770
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,440
of the document and also to uh to fix

1771
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,920
the intended audience and so that was

1772
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,440
the goal of this particular update and

1773
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,239
uh to spencer uh we have taken your

1774
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,880
comments about the tcp section on board

1775
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:29,679
and

1776
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:31,840
we have replied to you on that point as

1777
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,960
well but really i think

1778
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,760
our goal is to make sure that everyone

1779
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,080
in the working group uh agrees with the

1780
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,679
scope and the intended audience and we

1781
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,000
can take things forward from there

1782
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,440
yeah

1783
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,400
great

1784
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,560
all right thank you very much

1785
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,560
thank you thank you

1786
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,480
and i'll look forward to further

1787
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,560
discussion on the list and in the git

1788
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,560
repo

1789
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,440
um

1790
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,800
okay

1791
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,199
so that brings us to

1792
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:04,800
the uh the late ad discussion item

1793
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,600
so thank you eric you sent some comments

1794
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,159
as an 80 review of the draft itf mops

1795
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,320
ops cons um

1796
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,840
i think that there's material there for

1797
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,440
the draft authors to work through but i

1798
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,280
didn't know if the draft authors wanted

1799
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,040
to spend some time either talking to

1800
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,719
some of the points or

1801
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:23,040
asking further questions

1802
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,800
and i'm going to assume that everybody

1803
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,640
here has read that discussion on the

1804
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:27,840
mailing list because you're all

1805
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,760
subscribed and active contributors

1806
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,440
go ahead spencer

1807
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,480
yeah spencer dawkins

1808
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,679
and noting that there are two other

1809
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,280
draft editors on the on the uh here in

1810
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,679
meet echo

1811
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,000
so i invite them to

1812
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,400
help me think

1813
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,960
i looked at eric's uh comments and

1814
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,040
almost all of them i knew what to do

1815
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,080
with

1816
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,600
the only one

1817
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,800
that i did not know what to do with was

1818
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,440
uh his observation that some of the

1819
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,600
description of

1820
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,239
latency seemed

1821
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,719
overly lightened

1822
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,760
in the draft and

1823
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,560
after a spirit spirited

1824
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,560
conversation on email

1825
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,199
between me and ali one of the other

1826
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,560
editors

1827
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,600
i've convinced myself that

1828
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,320
what

1829
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,280
that the

1830
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,280
definition of

1831
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,000
latency categories in the draft which

1832
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,679
was

1833
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,920
hammered out at great length

1834
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,719
uh in this in this working group is

1835
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,360
reasonable for

1836
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,360
streaming media

1837
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,600
and

1838
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,199
we can talk about whether we should even

1839
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,520
be even mentioned

1840
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,280
video conferencing as a streaming

1841
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,880
application

1842
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,480
but

1843
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,280
i

1844
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,520
agree with ali that opening the

1845
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,360
conversation about

1846
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,840
latencies

1847
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,320
is in the context of this draft is not

1848
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,960
the right thing to do

1849
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,320
so i'm

1850
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,679
given that

1851
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:24,320
i think i know what to do with pretty

1852
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,960
much all the

1853
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,159
comments that that eric made and uh

1854
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,560
thank you eric for being gentle

1855
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,320
and uh

1856
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,400
let other people um

1857
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,239
express opinions about any of the other

1858
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,320
comments that uh

1859
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,400
may have been made

1860
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,480
i'll just go ahead and say this now if i

1861
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,719
can um

1862
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,159
i

1863
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:50,640
have been living with the

1864
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,360
nice people that are doing the mockmoff

1865
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,400
and

1866
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,320
the latency categories that they're

1867
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,440
talking about there are

1868
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,600
not

1869
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,440
to say you know not necessarily the same

1870
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,920
world as

1871
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,239
operational guidance that we would we

1872
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,640
would provide to existing

1873
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,960
people who are doing

1874
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,600
video streaming uh today

1875
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,400
and so like i say i've ali convinced me

1876
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,360
that

1877
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,280
uh we're talking about two different

1878
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,440
problems and it's okay

1879
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,520
to

1880
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,120
not change stuff

1881
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,280
in one description just because of the

1882
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,280
other thing we're talking about

1883
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,960
thank you okay

1884
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,199
thank you eric

1885
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,040
yeah andy all my comments are saying are

1886
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,880
pretty minor they are more the

1887
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,520
editorial side and really technical

1888
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,520
for me i have two things the latency i

1889
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,360
really want to point you on this if you

1890
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,040
confirm that you are okay with it i'm

1891
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,000
all set right you are the expert i'm not

1892
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,600
and the other parent is about the living

1893
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,040
documents

1894
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,800
and we got the discussion this morning

1895
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,159
within the isg we have not yet a way to

1896
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:59,199
do this

1897
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:00,960
so it will mostly be

1898
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,440
static when it's published maybe we can

1899
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,560
change it at all 48 to get some refresh

1900
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,520
and then after you will need the beast

1901
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,199
we hope to get something more coming in

1902
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,400
the

1903
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,800
one year two year but not for this one

1904
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,440
yeah so so it would be great to have a

1905
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,440
general ietf wide answer to the question

1906
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,199
of what to do with living documents i i

1907
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:23,280
will just throw out that

1908
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,320
in an earlier draft of this

1909
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,960
in an or in an earlier draft of this

1910
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,040
there was a discussion with uh john

1911
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,600
levine about how to refer to things

1912
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,560
um

1913
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,840
and i think that's a piece of the puzzle

1914
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,440
as well oh and i see that warren is

1915
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,560
about to

1916
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,840
warren's head is about to crater

1917
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,800
spencer spencer's in the queue though

1918
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,760
well spencer you really better anyway

1919
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,239
okay uh this is your regular host uh

1920
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,679
spencer dawkins

1921
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,760
and uh

1922
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,679
so if i'm remembering the conversation

1923
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,280
that we were having correctly on the

1924
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,520
previous version of the draft

1925
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,760
it was using something like tinyurl to

1926
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,920
generate the urls

1927
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,159
and so the question was what happens if

1928
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,520
tinyurl goes away

1929
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,440
so i think that

1930
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,400
one reasonable suggestion

1931
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,120
which people tell me is not totally

1932
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,960
crazy

1933
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,520
i would likely put in a pr for

1934
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,840
would be to

1935
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,400
create a

1936
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,280
dead pointer to a living document

1937
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,520
and at the end that the dead pointer

1938
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,760
which would not be

1939
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,840
which would not be updated

1940
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,239
would be pointing to a document

1941
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:48,719
maybe in the mock github or something

1942
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:50,400
like that

1943
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,560
where we where we could maintain it

1944
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,800
where we could maintain

1945
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,560
the

1946
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,600
really very useful list of things you

1947
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,120
ought to be following and things you

1948
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,159
ought to keep an eye on uh that are that

1949
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,800
are now in the draft if if not everybody

1950
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,880
has noticed that because it was added in

1951
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,320
fairly recent

1952
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,719
revisions uh it's worth taking a look at

1953
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,640
but i think it's really i think it's

1954
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,719
really useful for us to

1955
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,360
provide that to the readers

1956
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,239
uh and if we don't have to

1957
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,320
drive the rc

1958
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,320
people crazy um

1959
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,000
yeah and we can solve it

1960
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,679
if we can solve our problem ourselves

1961
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,760
maybe we don't have to wait for that

1962
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,719
thank you

1963
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,480
yeah well some of the implications and

1964
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,239
ramifications are the reasons why i

1965
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:39,920
would really look forward to an isg

1966
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,520
solution for this

1967
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,800
across the board because

1968
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,600
in a previous life i was known as our

1969
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,719
lady of identifiers

1970
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,360
and i'm trying to get over that

1971
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,719
but this is servicing a lot of the

1972
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,560
challenges with you know what is

1973
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,560
permanent what is i mean heck let's get

1974
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,440
into document formats too um

1975
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,760
while we're at it and um yeah so let's

1976
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,120
i'm not really not trying to drive

1977
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,719
warren under the carpet

1978
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,600
did you need the mike horn

1979
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,199
i'm gonna let warren have the mic and

1980
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,960
then we'll get back to the queue

1981
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,080
somebody's gonna have to cut me off

1982
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,199
because otherwise i'm gonna go on a

1983
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:18,640
20-minute rant

1984
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,600
um

1985
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,960
so

1986
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,560
we've tried to the living documents

1987
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,960
thing a few times and part of the

1988
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,960
problem seems to be that everybody's got

1989
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,480
their own use case

1990
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,400
so figuring out exactly what the use

1991
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,360
case would be seems like an option

1992
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,360
um i think the easiest thing that we

1993
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,360
came up with last time was

1994
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,520
there is one document which is owned by

1995
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,360
the chairs or someone

1996
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,360
and they just update it to point at the

1997
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,800
most recent

1998
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,080
version

1999
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,080
of another document which seems to be

2000
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,920
what everybody kind of agrees as the

2001
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,159
currently best

2002
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,840
viewed it's like the chairs kind of

2003
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,840
determine consensus that you know this

2004
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,760
thing is what everybody kind of agrees

2005
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,120
at the moment and they just have a

2006
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,560
document that points at that it's

2007
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,560
incredibly messy and ugly

2008
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,560
but it at least gets you something for

2009
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,600
now

2010
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,360
um but

2011
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,040
if people have the stomach to have the

2012
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,880
living documents discussion again that

2013
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,480
would be really useful

2014
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,480
i still think it's worth doing it just

2015
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,760
sort of as one of those endless

2016
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,520
discussions like document formats that

2017
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,320
just dies yep no and i think that the

2018
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,600
real challenge there is to have the

2019
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,719
discussion

2020
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,639
in the broader context than than the

2021
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:28,159
mops working group so

2022
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,600
yes and no well i mean i understand the

2023
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,360
theory as spencer suggested we could

2024
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,760
just solve our problems yeah yeah the

2025
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,000
issue is there's like 47 different use

2026
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,600
cases and if you have the broader one

2027
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,880
everybody's like mine's the most

2028
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,560
important yeah

2029
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,400
and clearly the mobs one is the most

2030
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,638
well naturally

2031
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,360
all right uh glenn you're next in the

2032
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,600
queue oh sorry

2033
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,199
conveniently spencer you're after glenn

2034
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,560
in the queue if you really wanted to say

2035
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,920
something

2036
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,639
um a couple of things uh in in no

2037
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:01,520
particular order um on the latency

2038
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,960
discussion i agree with the comments

2039
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,560
valley made and i'm glad spencer came

2040
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,440
around

2041
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,800
um

2042
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,040
overall you know latency is going to be

2043
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,120
a moving benchmark uh because it's an

2044
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,800
area of

2045
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,440
a lot of operational investment by

2046
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,960
various parties both in standards and

2047
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,080
also in technology to move latency into

2048
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,639
uh ever ever lower numbers

2049
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:23,760
so it's always going to be a moving

2050
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,320
thing uh on the discussion of living

2051
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,440
documents

2052
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,520
um you know one

2053
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,040
one thing mom should consider if we're

2054
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,120
going to do this sort of isolate alone

2055
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,880
and not try to solve the bigger picture

2056
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,920
which i agree with um is also the

2057
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,280
concern though that if the itf does get

2058
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,040
requests for

2059
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,719
uh citations by lawyers and and signed

2060
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:48,960
you know what happened when um

2061
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,120
whatever solution we decide in mobs

2062
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,040
should be able to support

2063
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,360
uh those legal frameworks that the itf

2064
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,000
does get pinged on occasionally uh by

2065
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,679
law firms

2066
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,239
so as a consideration

2067
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:03,679
and github probably is not the best

2068
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,440
place

2069
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,760
i've said my piece

2070
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,880
right thanks for that spencer did you

2071
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,040
wanna

2072
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,600
and then i think we will

2073
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,199
unless there are other unless there are

2074
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:20,480
other issues with the document

2075
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,320
and and this one this is on this is on

2076
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,719
that one uh the my my uh

2077
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,320
my question is just

2078
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,159
i'm not going to break i'm not going to

2079
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,840
raise my hand about this at the plenary

2080
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,520
right we all agree

2081
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,639
okay just making sure

2082
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:37,520
yes

2083
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,080
um okay so i think that that was useful

2084
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,560
discussion around the points in

2085
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,480
um

2086
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,120
the mops ar you know sorry in the ops

2087
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,480
cons sanjay did you want to jump in on

2088
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,199
oh yeah this is sanjay just real quick i

2089
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,199
mean the the decision on living document

2090
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:57,360
does not have to be made i mean if we

2091
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,040
should publish the document of course if

2092
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,920
there's consensus and if after the

2093
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,679
publication there's a really good use

2094
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,920
case that we think belongs in that

2095
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,600
document then we can always you know

2096
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,239
revisit it but i don't know if we want

2097
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:11,600
to consider this as a like living

2098
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,159
document you know forever

2099
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,560
yep all right so i think i think eric

2100
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,840
you correctly identified the two major

2101
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,880
issues with the document latency and

2102
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,880
the zombie document problem

2103
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,400
um

2104
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,159
okay then

2105
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,600
thank you very much for that and and

2106
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,440
i'll take this opportunity to say thank

2107
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,120
you very much to sanjay who is the

2108
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,880
document shepard and did all the work to

2109
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,199
do the write-up and get it to the isg so

2110
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,919
thank you sanjay

2111
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,760
all right um

2112
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,320
and now we should move on to the

2113
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,520
milestones discussion um

2114
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,360
i wanted to

2115
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,320
uh

2116
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,159
to get there because

2117
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,320
the current state of our milestones i

2118
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,080
won't say is woeful there are certainly

2119
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,920
more woeful

2120
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,360
milestones lists

2121
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,199
and and of course you've you've all seen

2122
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:04,639
these because i sent all this to the

2123
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:07,440
mailing list on friday-ish

2124
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,199
um

2125
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,520
so i've just noted here the the items

2126
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,960
that are uh

2127
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:13,920
either

2128
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,840
either seem to be out of out of scope or

2129
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,440
whatever so

2130
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,560
we were we had as a list on our list to

2131
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,080
last call a document on sm simpty's use

2132
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,719
of our reliance on our protocols since

2133
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:29,440
we don't even have a draft of that

2134
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,920
and simply seems to be moving away from

2135
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,760
some of the uh

2136
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,239
really ietf related work at the moment i

2137
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,320
think that it just doesn't seem to be

2138
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,760
i don't think we should have this on our

2139
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:40,960
list at all i think we should punt on

2140
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:41,920
that one

2141
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,520
revisit it when there are more in-person

2142
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,000
meetings for both the ietf and symtee

2143
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,719
um and then see where to go from there

2144
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,800
for the streaming video alliance

2145
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,400
document that also doesn't exist yet um

2146
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,920
i think we move it out a little bit

2147
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,400
because um

2148
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,560
i i believe we've updated a possible

2149
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,120
pointer to a plan

2150
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,280
that's enough layers of indirection to

2151
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,920
cause that document to to exist

2152
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,719
um and i think that by july we should be

2153
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,639
in we should be possibly even seeing a

2154
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,320
draft of that document

2155
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,560
so that's my proposal there

2156
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,320
um we have done two of our milestones

2157
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,360
um

2158
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,600
and um yeah the november 2021 71 also

2159
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,000
out because it didn't happen

2160
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,040
um

2161
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,280
and then there was a bogon

2162
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,719
um

2163
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,400
i think that there was a mist we just

2164
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,159
didn't clean up the milestones properly

2165
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:37,440
last time

2166
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,800
um and we do have a revised um

2167
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,679
ar

2168
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:43,360
use case document

2169
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,960
so

2170
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,920
all of that markup is kind of messy

2171
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,000
and the net net is it

2172
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,800
i'm proposing this for our updated

2173
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,199
milestones

2174
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,880
you don't actually have to decide this

2175
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,080
here

2176
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,840
but i would certainly look to see if

2177
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,679
there's any discussion or pushback or

2178
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:04,080
thoughts

2179
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,320
that

2180
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,600
aren't on cleaning up the milestones

2181
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,840
this way

2182
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,040
and i'm assuming that was our area

2183
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,400
director's agreement these are the most

2184
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,080
stunning awesome milestones they've ever

2185
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,280
seen

2186
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,719
yeah go ahead colin

2187
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,199
well i was just going to ask

2188
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:24,719
just an informational question just what

2189
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,639
how do you imagine that you're drafting

2190
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,440
the reliance the sva reliance what do

2191
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,880
you imagine that looking like is that

2192
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:31,760
just like

2193
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,760
a list of references of the stuff they

2194
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,520
use that we're doing or what it what was

2195
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,000
that what does that look like so

2196
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,480
um i think it's useful to know what

2197
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,000
things what the relationships are

2198
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,040
between the work that we're doing and

2199
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,960
the work that sva is doing and you know

2200
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,320
we've had reports every meeting from sva

2201
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,520
saying you know we're doing this and

2202
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,960
this is how it touches some of the ietf

2203
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,560
protocols

2204
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,800
for example the work on cdni with which

2205
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,560
sanjay is intimately familiar and and

2206
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,480
that was referenced in

2207
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,199
in

2208
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,440
glenn's presentation earlier

2209
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,199
so

2210
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:06,080
sorry dry air i'm gonna cough

2211
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,280
um

2212
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,480
it's

2213
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,159
i think the important thing here really

2214
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,320
is to understand how

2215
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,000
entities that are doing

2216
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,960
more evolved things with video or more

2217
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,840
industry specific things with video

2218
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,760
are relying on our

2219
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,280
protocols so that we have some

2220
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,920
understanding of you know who our users

2221
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,840
are and what we might like to take into

2222
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,840
account i don't think it's directive in

2223
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,280
any way i think it's entirely

2224
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,719
informative

2225
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:34,480
okay so look i mean i just as two

2226
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,639
examples of ranges of spectrum for

2227
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:39,760
webrtc i capped a draft that just had

2228
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,840
where the status of where all our all of

2229
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,639
our drafts and rfcs were that the w3c

2230
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,719
could use to look at that there's and it

2231
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,800
had everything that the w3c depended

2232
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,199
upon that for webrtc

2233
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,880
um and that was one in the spectrum and

2234
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,320
then the other inspector back when we

2235
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,320
were doing a lot of sip stuff i mean the

2236
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,719
liaison managers kept an amazing excel

2237
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:00,400
spreadsheet that was reviewed at every

2238
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,239
you know every three months in a formal

2239
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,880
meeting um so i i anyway and both of

2240
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,320
those turned out to be really useful so

2241
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,600
i'm not quite sure you have in mind here

2242
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,960
but it was useful

2243
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,080
well thanks very much for those

2244
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,920
suggestions and uh i think we'll

2245
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,440
certainly keep them in mind and i think

2246
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,440
somewhere perhaps somewhere in between

2247
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,120
and perhaps a little bit of a backing

2248
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,639
story in part because

2249
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,480
you know part of the goal is for people

2250
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,560
to know that the sva exists and for the

2251
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,840
sva to remember that we exist spencer is

2252
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,120
that a new cue it's a new queue

2253
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,760
thanks colin

2254
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,600
this is spencer dawkins and this is

2255
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,600
actually just a follow-up for cullen's

2256
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,120
thing

2257
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,120
i mentioned earlier yeah we are

2258
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,679
chartered to provide

2259
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,800
input to

2260
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,520
protocol working groups about gaps and

2261
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,280
deficiencies in

2262
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,280
the protocols that people are trying to

2263
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,159
use

2264
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:56,560
so i think that uh

2265
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,520
the producing that document for someone

2266
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,120
who's trying to do

2267
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,840
more than just

2268
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,280
show up you know show up show a video uh

2269
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,800
is is a really useful first step towards

2270
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,600
saying

2271
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,719
do what you know do we have

2272
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,600
do do we have everything that we need

2273
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,920
uh or you know or is there other stuff

2274
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,800
we haven't really talked much that i've

2275
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,400
that i can remember about uh gaps and i

2276
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,520
think that

2277
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,520
um

2278
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,400
having

2279
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,560
mops members participating in the

2280
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,480
mock-up

2281
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,159
on wednesday it's going to be a really

2282
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:41,040
good opportunity for

2283
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,280
that kind of input to happen

2284
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,440
uh i know we have

2285
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,480
one person from the broadcast

2286
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,760
type business

2287
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,639
that's been active in discussions about

2288
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:54,960
and mock but uh

2289
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,199
a lot of other kind a lot of other kinds

2290
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:59,199
of operators

2291
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,199
that haven't haven't been represented at

2292
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:04,000
all i think it'd be useful to have that

2293
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,880
uh in a non-work group forming buff

2294
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,639
yeah so i think part of what i'm hearing

2295
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,480
and what you're saying is that um maybe

2296
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,000
we shouldn't expect to be last calling

2297
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,360
the document a couple of months after

2298
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,040
the first draft appears

2299
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:19,280
um so the november 2022

2300
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,120
milestones should probably be moved out

2301
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,679
or changed from last call to an update

2302
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,560
or something yeah

2303
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,080
okay

2304
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,800
all right that sounds good

2305
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,679
um

2306
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,000
i will send that update to the mailing

2307
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,320
list and you know gather whatever

2308
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,480
comments other comments show up there

2309
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,320
give it a couple weeks and plan i think

2310
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,880
file and i will confirm that

2311
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,239
it looks like we've updated milestones

2312
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:47,120
and then do the updates

2313
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,040
so with that um

2314
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:52,239
is there any other business

2315
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,880
not hearing any other business

2316
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,199
going once going twice and i asked kyle

2317
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:02,320
a couple minutes ago but i don't know if

2318
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,199
he's

2319
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:06,080
lost his connection

2320
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,639
it's been fine since i've switched to my

2321
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:13,440
tablet and had my video off so

2322
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,400
but i don't have anything else

2323
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,280
all right well that's the important bit

2324
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,120
then i will say thank you everybody for

2325
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:24,880
coming virtually or physically and um

2326
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,080
yeah

2327
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,760
close officially close the meeting thank

2328
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,840

is

2332
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,159
but if they were as soon as i said they

2333
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,840
just moved away they were very friendly

2334
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,239
they just didn't notice yeah

2335
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:35,360
