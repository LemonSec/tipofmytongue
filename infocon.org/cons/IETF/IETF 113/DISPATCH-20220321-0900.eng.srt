unable to join uh virtually or in person

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,879
so it's great to have us all here for

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,320
dispatch we're just going to go through

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,719
some of the uh stuff to kick us off

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
so this is the notewell this is

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,479
something you all agreed to when you

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,760
registered to join itf113 and just a

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
reminder especially because it's our

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,560
first in-person meeting in a while that

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
by participating in the itf you've

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,680
agreed to follow all these processes and

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,520
policies so this covers things like

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,000
patent patent applications but also just

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
to make everyone aware that everything's

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,240
being recorded in the room and online as

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,960
well and all of this good stuff all of

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
those bcps that we suggest you read if

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,360
you haven't already

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,720
and then i always like to put in a note

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
really well um because this is the

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,240
important things i think that we should

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
just really be aware of to build a good

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
itf culture as we all return so meetings

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
and virtual meetings and mailing lists

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,920
are intended for professional

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
collaboration and networking but if you

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
have any concerns about any behaviour

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,159
talk to the ombuds team they're there to

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,920
allow you to confidentiality at

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
confidentially raised concerns about

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,439
harassment or any other conduct you see

53
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,719
in the itf

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,000
it's really important especially as

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,280
we're coming back to create an

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
environment where many people with

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,479
different backgrounds are treated with

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,000
dignity and respect

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
anyone who participates in the itf is

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,680
expected to behave according to

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,878
professional standards and have

62
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,959
appropriate workplace behavior and again

63
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,480
if you think that that's falling short

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
talk to the ombuds team

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,760
so specifically do not engage in

66
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,520
harassment while you're in virtual

67
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
meetings in person meetings social

68
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,000
events or on mailing lists it is not

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,599
acceptable and if you believe you've

70
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,280
been harassed them or you see someone

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
else being harassed then please raise

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,319
your concerns and confidence to ombuds

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,560
team

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,440
okay so itf 113 meeting tips this

75
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
session is being recorded for people in

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
the room please sign into the session

77
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,560
using the meet echo lite client if you

78
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,239
use the full version client then your

79
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,599
video will probably appear on this

80
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,200
screen which will be delightful for

81
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,560
everyone in the room but maybe a bit

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
embarrassing for you so do use the

83
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
lights client and very importantly cue

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,519
management so if you get up and stand up

85
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,519
at the mic but you have not clicked this

86
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,280
button in meet echo to say you will be

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,040
joining the queue we won't be calling

88
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,319
your name out so you will just be

89
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,080
standing at the mic for quite a while

90
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,760
wondering what's going on

91
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
so make sure you join the queue on the

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
meet echo client and then stand up to go

93
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,239
to the queue now for those joining

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,760
virtually we're going to be calling the

95
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,599
queue in the order it appears on meet

96
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,360
echo so there is no preference for

97
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,599
virtual or in-person participants it's

98
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,519
just the order in which you click to

99
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,599
join the queue

100
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,680
for remote participants hi welcome it's

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,599
great to have you here as well just make

102
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,360
sure that your video and your audio are

103
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,959
off unless you are chairing or

104
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,200
presenting a session and if you can we

105
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
strongly recommend that you use a

106
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,200
headset

107
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,519
here are some resources you can find the

108
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,040
agenda and all the meeting materials

109
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
there and specifically for dispatch we

110
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,840
need note takers so it's been a while

111
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
since we got to actually look at people

112
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
in the room and stare as people avoid

113
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,120
our gaze to pick a note-taker but head

114
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,000
on over to notes.itf.org

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,159
and help us take accurate and good notes

116
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,760
for the session you know they're useful

117
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,959
you know you love them so please

118
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,640
contribute

119
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
and we've got jabba and zulip as well in

120
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,200
the room um if you want to join the chat

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,720
it's great to have jabba going on but

122
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
please do bring any important points to

123
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,400
the queue so that we actually hear them

124
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,599
on the recording afterwards

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
i just wanted to add one thing to that

126
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,880
which is that the qr code in the media

127
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
echo light is not just so you can ask

128
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
questions it's also the blue sheets so

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
instead of passing around a piece of

130
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,120
paper covered in in people's slimy

131
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
handwriting

132
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,040
take a photo of that qr code or navigate

133
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,880
to the agenda and click on it there

134
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
either way once you open that medeco

135
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,720
light client log in with your data

136
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
tracker login that's what's going to get

137
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
you listed as being present in the room

138
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,520
so please do that thanks

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,639
okay and that is it i think we're going

140
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,240
to kick off so we're going to take a

141
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
look at our agenda for today

142
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,759
um i hope we spent a good amount of time

143
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,440
going through the status and our agenda

144
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,600
bash um and then we've got these

145
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,240

just as you're joining we need you to

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
share your slides

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,000
so you can do this um

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
just at the top

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
and next to the phrase

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,080
there's a button to share preloaded

174
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
slides

175
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,840
it says no slides available

176
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,960
ah now okay

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,000
yeah i say that too

178
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,720
maybe shall i just share them for you

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,560
have you got them here because it says

180
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,400
no slides available to me when i go into

181
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,440
the materials as well

182
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,280
i have them

183
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
okay i have the slides so i can just

184
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,080
drive for you i think they are imported

185
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,199
but perhaps they're not showing okay

186
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,599
perfect

187
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,440
yeah thanks kirsty um this is my first

188
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,360
time at the ietf

189
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
so i'm pleased to be here

190
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,560
so

191
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
what is the campaign feedback loop

192
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,319
address header about

193
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,680
um

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,840
the header allows an email sender to

195
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
signal the mailbox provider that they

196
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,919
are happy to process

197
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,960
complaints from their users

198
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,280
could you move on with this slide

199
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
um there is

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
there is the feedback loop mechanism for

201
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,039
a long time which allows mailbox

202
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,560
providers to follow

203
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,280
forward complaints from their users back

204
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,759
to the sender however

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,240
the current implementation must be

206
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,639
set up manually by the sender with each

207
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,840
provider

208
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,639
that provides a feedback loop

209
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,440
in addition to setting up a feedback

210
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
loop for the first time

211
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,639
there is also the revalidation of an

212
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,240
already existing and setup loop

213
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
if you want to change for example the

214
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,879
complaint email address you need to go

215
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,280
through all providers and change the

216
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,479
address which is time consuming as well

217
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,000
nowadays

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
where dkm gains more and more importance

219
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,759
in reputation building it also gets more

220
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,840
relevant for feedback loops

221
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,440
um feedback group provider move from ip

222
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,880
based ones to dicken-based ones or a

223
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,479
mixed version of it

224
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,039
which makes it harder to for example

225
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,839
main maintain it for customers

226
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,040
when it comes to to sending platforms or

227
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
esp's

228
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,240
additionally such a manual process is

229
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,120
not very suitable for smaller mailbox

230
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,000
providers who would be happy to provide

231
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,760
such a feedback loop

232
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,880
um as they need to develop and maintain

233
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,140
a

234
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,240
[Music]

235
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,080
setup platform for senders to maintain

236
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,959
their feedback loops

237
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,518
next slide

238
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,880
so my experimental proposal is to have

239
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
two new headers um

240
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,200
why to new why new

241
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,320
why two

242
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,040
headers um one for the actual feedback

243
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,480
loop address

244
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,800
um and one for an id um

245
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,920
under some circumstances um the message

246
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,040
id of the sender can't be used

247
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,560
for example

248
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,160
because the message id is generated

249
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,680
somewhere else

250
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,720
else

251
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,120
where the

252
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,440
feedback complaints

253
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,839
are processed

254
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,320
both header needs to be covered by a

255
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,240
stickem signature

256
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
which matches the domain in the header

257
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,480
itself and the from header

258
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,680
this would be the supports case um there

259
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,640
are two more cases described in the

260
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,320
draft itself

261
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
um nevertheless

262
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,120
this header requires some kind of

263
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,440
reputation data

264
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,000
on site the main pro on the side of the

265
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,720
mailbox provider on to assess the

266
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,079
trustworthiness of the sender itself

267
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,320
but in most cases

268
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,200
the mailbox provider do already have

269
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
some kind of

270
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,279
reputation data

271
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,760
to for example rate limiting or

272
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,440
something like that

273
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,480
um

274
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,120
with with this reputation data it should

275
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,079
be

276
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,720
possible to avoid that

277
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,079
complaint reports are sent to spammers

278
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,600
to approve

279
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,600
proof that there is an actual mailbox as

280
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,320
such a complaint report is based on a

281
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,360
manual

282
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
action by the mailbox owner

283
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
could you move on

284
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,160
please

285
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,200
thanks

286
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,920
so this is the actual header itself um

287
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,040
you see there is the header cf address

288
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,760
which contains the um

289
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,320
address where the complaint

290
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,680
reports should be sent and two deakin

291
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,720
signatures one for the actual from

292
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
header and one for the

293
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,880
domain of the cfpl address

294
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,560
this is the complexer one

295
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
it requires a double signature which is

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
a common practice when it comes to

297
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
sending platforms

298
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,440
who are sending mails for their

299
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
customers um

300
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,839
yeah could you move on

301
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,959
thanks uh so how should this draft be

302
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,920
dispatched um i think ad sponsoring

303
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
would be the best way

304
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,480
currently there is no obvious working

305
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,600
group for el for it the email core

306
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
working group is currently rejecting

307
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,240
work as they are updating the course

308
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,760
backs

309
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,519
in my opinion it's not worth its own

310
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,320
working group as it is

311
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,639
experimental proposal

312
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,440
so

313
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,560
the best way would be ad sponsoring or

314
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,360
when there is no contents or interest

315
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,440
within the ietf

316
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,320
i

317
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,440
back with the ise

318
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,000
next slide please

319
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
yeah thanks for your time and uh

320
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,160
for your feedback

321
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,959
okay super so we'd like to invite people

322
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,040
to come to the mic and express their

323
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,519
opinion on ditch dispatch question here

324
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,360
are the options as the author sees them

325
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,279
of course you may see others so just

326
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,480
remember to click the join q button and

327
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
then come to the mic in the room or

328
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,120
we'll call the virtual queue as it

329
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
appears

330
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,120
so uh john levine first

331
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,880
is it

332
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959
can you hear me this is the first time

333
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,880
tried you okay

334
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,760
thank you

335
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
um i think this is a reasonable proposal

336
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,560
i mean

337
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
i i run an informal

338
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
um site called abuse net which is

339
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
essentially a database of contact

340
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,839
addresses and this would move the

341
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,920
contact addresses into the message i'm

342
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,000
not particularly worried about

343
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
that some of the some of the notices

344
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,199
might go to spammers i mean either

345
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,480
they'll ignore them or they'll take you

346
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,160
or they'll stop sending you mail neither

347
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,480
of which makes your situation worse

348
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,000
and um

349
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,959
i

350
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,120
and i i know the authors and i think

351
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,480
there's there's some

352
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,160
there is some interest for to be a

353
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,519
useful experiment you actually need to

354
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,639
have some people who are interested in

355
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,560
performing the experiment and i believe

356
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,240
it's i believe that some people some of

357
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,839
these people may exist and i'm looking

358
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,199
forward to see what braun has to say

359
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,680
about it so i think it

360
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,240
it's it's worth it this is it seems this

361
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,600
is the edwards harmless i think it's

362
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,240
worth advancing

363
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,399
okay thank you john and so your view on

364
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,040
the dispatch question

365
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
not worth a working group so either so a

366
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,639
d sponsored makes sense

367
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,120
thank you okay uh braun next in the

368
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,920
queue

369
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
i'm right here i was going to comment

370
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,120
that there seems to be quite a lot of

371
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,760
email work coming at the moment

372
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,440
so it may be that it's worth having a

373
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,560
working group for handling collected

374
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,800
email work rather than having each thing

375
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,480
be ad sponsored or independent

376
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,680
submissions

377
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,560
regarding this spec itself there is

378
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,880
currently an issue with dkim replay

379
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,800
attacks and i'm not sure how this would

380
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,639
solve that that you have

381
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,880
an email which is perfectly legitimate

382
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
to the one destination it gets to but if

383
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
someone then replays that to a million

384
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,279
people

385
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,160
by basically sfvc seeing just having

386
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,000
receipt to an address that was not

387
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,839
involved with the original email you'll

388
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,360
wind up getting a lot of feedback from

389
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
that which will cause domain reputation

390
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
problems for the sender

391
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
so we're going to have to solve that

392
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,959
problem too probably before we make it

393
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,440
even easier for feedback loops to to

394
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,120
damage the center's reputation or people

395
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
won't add this

396
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
thank you and so your view on the

397
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,079
dispatch question

398
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,079
i think we should look at possibly

399
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,839
opening a working group for handling all

400
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,040
the email stuff

401
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
if not that then

402
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,839
area director sponsored makes sense

403
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,680
thank you and handily you can see our

404
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,519
area director in the virtual queue

405
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,519
murray

406
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,240
it was very weak yesterday

407
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,839
you're very quiet

408
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,240
yeah okay um

409
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
i will just type it into the chat then i

410
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,519
have to figure out the audio on my end

411
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,839
so i'll go to the chat in a second

412
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
oh um i think the room can hear you but

413
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
maybe we can't because the speakers are

414
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,759
facing the room so

415
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,759
no

416
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,199
well we'll i'll just read it out from

417
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,720
the chat if you pop it in there or you

418
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,480
can say it now all right

419
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
that's that's fine oh no it just says

420
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,160
success we can hear you now is that

421
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,480
better

422
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,360
no okay

423
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,079
um we don't have anyone else in the

424
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,199
queue in the room or virtually

425
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,560
just pause

426
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
i think the sense of the room is that

427
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,880
this is worthwhile work that can go

428
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,759
forward modular the problems that bronn

429
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,360
um just mentioned that we need to

430
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,920
address but

431
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,639
just have a kind of reading of the room

432
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,160
which is nice to be able to do in person

433
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,680
actually for a change can see how many

434
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,600
of you are smiling and nodding behind

435
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,199
your masks um so i think that we've

436
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,800
heard a lot this should either be ad

437
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
sponsored or a new working group created

438
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,959
we'll just kind of pause and wait for

439
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,560
murray to share his thoughts in the chat

440
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,800
being the ad that would sponsor likely

441
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,520
and then i can see in jabba um colin

442
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,799
jennings is just sharing giving the

443
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,799
security feedback just raised i don't

444
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,799
think ad sponsor is a good path cullen

445
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,079
do you want to come to the mic and just

446
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,880
sort of elaborate on that slightly

447
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,439
if you're able to

448
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
i'll try and see yes uh my audio working

449
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,119
yeah

450
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,240
okay

451
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,160
so look i'm not i don't fully i'm not an

452
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,520
expert in space i don't know whether the

453
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,280
security issue raised was totally you

454
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,960
know bona fide but it sounded like a

455
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,120
real issue and if so i think that that

456
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,960
pushes you towards this is

457
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
a little bit more complicated and having

458
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,559
a working group environment to deal it

459
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,360
in would probably be better than um

460
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,600
than just ad sponsored would be would be

461
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,120
my leaning but that's that's said from a

462
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
point of not deep knowledge on this

463
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,039
space

464
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,320
thank you

465
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
so um i think that that sounds like

466
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,320
quite a lot of consensus around

467
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,919
creating a new working group that would

468
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,080
cover this and perhaps some of the other

469
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,360
email

470
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,200
pieces that are coming to ietf in in

471
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,720
drips and drabs

472
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,080
we'll just

473
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,200
wait for murray to share his thoughts in

474
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,960
chat and then

475
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,080
we'll loop back at the end of the

476
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,559
session to confirm that dispatch outcome

477
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,400
but for now thank you john philippe for

478
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,840

479
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,480

so we'll now move on to the next item on

484
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,840
the agenda which is nikkita

485
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960

486
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,039
agenda and move on to the next

499
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
cannot make it because he's currently

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,080
on instead of stephen speaking

504
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,720
eloquently on this topic you can look at

505
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,840
the slides

506
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,360
thank you

okay and uh so next slide please

508
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,000
um

509
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,960
so this draft is about uh encrypted

510
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,559
client hello which is a tls feature

511
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,960
that allows you to encrypt the client

512
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,440
hello to a

513
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,720
a server

514
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,799
a cover server which is

515
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,400
fronting

516
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
for

517
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,799
servers in the back end in order to

518
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,280
protect the identity of the server that

519
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
a client is trying to

520
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,640
connect to so it's a privacy feature

521
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,919
to basically hide the sni the server

522
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,240
name indication

523
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,480
and so

524
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,880
in steven's setup of

525
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,000
ech

526
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,559
he has

527
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,159
a number of front-end servers

528
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,400
that have their public keys

529
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,000
that are rotated regularly so these keys

530
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,120
are used

531
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,360
by the client to encrypt the traffic to

532
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,840
these cover servers

533
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,400
the client learns about these keys from

534
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,559
dns

535
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,600
but

536
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,159
in order to get those keys in dns you

537
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,559
need some mechanism and currently

538
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,799
this setup doesn't use

539
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,840
dynamic dns or some other api so he has

540
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,799
a an orchestrator or a zone factory

541
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,480
that basically

542
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,720
queries each of his front-end servers to

543
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,520
learn their public key and then goes and

544
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,240
does the proper configuration

545
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,280
in in dns

546
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,480
um

547
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,400
and so in one could configure the url

548
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,480
here uh

549
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,760
but instead

550
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,559
it seems it would be better to

551
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,120
use a dot well known url

552
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,200
so that's kind of the summary we'll go

553
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,559
into a little bit more detail next slide

554
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,559
so here's a sample

555
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,520
json data structure that would be a

556
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,640
provision for a particular server

557
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,200
it basically contains information that

558
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,799
would go into the into the dns

559
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,200
and including this config list which

560
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,679
contains the public key and some names

561
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,200
uh associated with the with the back end

562
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,520
services that this server would front

563
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,760
for

564
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,679
next slide please

565
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,640
um

566
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,200
so uh for

567
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,120
one of the possible use cases here is is

568
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,480
with a cdn

569
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,760
um so for example

570
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,000
um

571
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,080
in different scenarios this the cdn

572
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,200
might not

573
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
uh the client

574
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,039
may not use this cdn as their dns

575
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,000
operator and so in order to update these

576
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,880
uh

577
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,280
config lists they would need a a

578
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,960
different mechanism

579
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,320
um

580
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,960
and and this is a a possible use case

581
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
for that

582
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,080
um so

583
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,919
basically the

584
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,280
uh dns operator could pull these urls to

585
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,080
learn the public keys of these servers

586
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,639
next slide

587
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,200
and here's kind of a picture

588
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,960
here we have the client the client

589
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,919
learning

590
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,480
uh the

591
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,520
ech information from dns and using that

592
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
to connect securely to the front end

593
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,240
server which then forwards

594
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,799
uh the clear text

595
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,120
client hello to the backend server and

596
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,640
we have this

597
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,840
zone factory

598
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,440
orchestrator that learns about these

599
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,640
public keys

600
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,240
and publishes them to the dns

601
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,799
next slide

602
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,799
okay so some of the questions here is is

603
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,480
you know is this

604
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,720
is this a more general problem

605
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,730
um

606
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,480
[Music]

607
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,360
and

608
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,960
is is a more generic approach of

609
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,240
something we should be looking at

610
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,760
in general

611
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,240
it seems like this mechanism specific to

612
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,320
ech is is a good approach instead of

613
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,600
trying to solve

614
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,120
you know kind of a general service

615
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,760
discovery problem

616
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
i think i would agree with steven here

617
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,840
that probably a more specific solution

618
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,799
is is better here but i don't really

619
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,440
know either

620
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,720
next slide

621
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,000
um

622
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,039
so just like ech this is a work in

623
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,080
progress

624
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,279
um

625
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,440
this might not be the optimal way to do

626
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,400
things

627
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,679
but uh

628
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,559
if it's not a bad idea

629
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,360
then

630
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,440
you know this is a proposal that could

631
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,679
be modified to

632
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,840
be better

633
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,918
if people see other ways of doing things

634
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,919
but uh you know so there's some

635
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,159
relatively straightforward things we

636
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,799
would need to do in terms of publishing

637
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,960
um

638
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
the draft and looking into some other

639
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,360
options such as alpn i'm not sure

640
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,760
exactly

641
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,520
which

642
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,440
what that's referring to

643
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,679
but

644
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,440
the json

645
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,279
you know details could be modified if

646
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,080
necessary so basically

647
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,600
steven's willing to

648
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,240
turn control over to whatever mechanism

649
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,559
they want to move forward

650
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,400
but really this is a fairly simple

651
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,679
mechanism

652
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,000
and shouldn't require a lot of work

653
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,679
because it's just

654
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,679
basically uh communicating data

655
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,760
structures that have already been mostly

656
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,279
defined within

657
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,880
the ech draft

658
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,880
next slide just to say just to say we've

659
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,960
had someone join the queue um so let's

660
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
see if you have a

661
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,120
oh okay

662
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,600
okay

663
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,320
shall i say this for you thanks thanks

664
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,200
for presenting in steven's place um

665
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,360
and so i guess yeah we'll take cues here

666
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,799
are the dispatch questions

667
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,919
okay so alexi this

668
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,679
looks reasonable

669
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,320
obviously it's a you know big cross

670
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,600
between

671
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,799
art and security

672
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,880
i'm just thinking that maybe you should

673
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,480
bring it to http api working group just

674
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,279
to

675
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,440
they can either try to adopt it or

676
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
sanity check that what you're well

677
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,960
stephen

678
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,480
and you're doing is correct

679
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,480
even if they don't

680
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,919
take it

681
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,600
but say yeah it seems reasonable that

682
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,120
might be a

683
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,880
mark mark has a probably a better

684
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,000
opinion about this so

685
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,559
okay uh ted hardy you're next in the

686
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,440
queue

687
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,679
uh ted hardy speaking uh so i think the

688
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,279
dispatch questions for this are kind of

689
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,520
very different depending on whether you

690
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
generalize it or not

691
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,600
and i i think i'm pretty persuaded that

692
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,679
a general mechanism here would be a

693
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,279
useful thing and that that would

694
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,720
probably need a short-lived working

695
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,679
group

696
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,600
because there's some coordination

697
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,760
between how you think about

698
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,000
the configuration aspects from the dns

699
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,840
side of this and how you can

700
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,399
think about them from the htp side and

701
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,919
the two different caching semantics

702
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,520
always want a little bit more thinking

703
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,240
than

704
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,880
you're gonna do in in one short thing if

705
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,360
if we decide not to generalize it

706
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,480
then um i i think the dispatch would

707
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,840
probably be

708
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,360
uh independent

709
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,279
submission to an area director but

710
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,840
reviewed by http um for the for the

711
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,480
reasons i think alexi was alluding to

712
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,440
first

713
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,080
uh and so to me the question is which

714
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,440
should this be

715
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,039
and i think the point you're making

716
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,559
about this being sort of experimental

717
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,799
and us not being sure yet

718
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,240
exactly what's going to happen in the

719
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,320
space points to the idea that you might

720
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,960
actually want to generalize this

721
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,279
so as it evolves you can keep using it

722
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,600
without

723
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,039
re-revving the point solution multiple

724
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,120
times and then creating croft out of the

725
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,279
point solutions you're not going to use

726
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,000
but it is more work obviously

727
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,080
so i would suggest that if if others

728
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,440
don't agree that they'd be willing to

729
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,960
review the documents and help with the

730
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,200
work then the point solution is probably

731
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,480
reasonable enough for right now

732
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,360
thanks

733
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,320
thank you

734
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,200
martin thompson you're next

735
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,720
yeah so ted

736
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,960
uh touched on a couple of things i agree

737
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,600
with i'm not sure yet as to whether the

738
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,919
generalization is necessary here

739
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,039
what i do think however is that the um

740
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,960
solution whatever it is will require a

741
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,360
little bit more operator input than than

742
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,520
just stephen's little experiment

743
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,600
and so i think ultimately this is the

744
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,799
sort of thing that needs to go through a

745
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,480
working group either way

746
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,080
i don't know whether that's

747
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,760
http or tls probably http if you go for

748
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,360
the specific solution

749
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,679
uh i don't have an opinion on the

750
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,840
generic thing and

751
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,360
i'd like to hear from people who are

752
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
looking to operate service b records and

753
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
other protocols before

754
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,240
i

755
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,840
have an answer to that question

756
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,720
okay thank you martin um mark nottingham

757
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,840
am i here yes we can see on here you

758
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,039
might go for it okay okay hello people

759
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,039
in a room in vienna um

760
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,559
so i i

761
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,120
got in queue to um respond to alexi

762
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,799
about hp api that that's not what the

763
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,679
hba api working group is for i would not

764
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,200
want to see it

765
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,520
burdened with kind of reviewing things

766
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,679
for for whether they're good apis or not

767
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,760
um i think that would be bad for what

768
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,440
we're trying to do there so please don't

769
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,000
try to use it that way um

770
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,840
regarding

771
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,760
i think following on with what martin

772
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,039
said

773
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,039
my impression when i read this was you

774
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,320
know

775
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,360
maybe

776
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,120
um it seems like we need you know

777
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,799
there's a lot going on in this general

778
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,880
space and i my impression is

779
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,320
implementers are pretty overloaded

780
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,919
already trying to figure out how it all

781
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,120
should work

782
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,520
hi philip hello dalek

783
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,720
um

784
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,039
and uh um

785
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,039
i i think probably i'd sit on it for a

786
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,320
while and and

787
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,080
have implementers think about it phillip

788
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,960
could you mute please

789
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,559
philip hello banker hi

790
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,120
philip okay

791
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,880
um you want to mute yourself because

792
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,200
it's just um detracting from what mark's

793
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,360
saying

794
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,440
okay thank you i'm not sure

795
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,320
okay

796
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,200
um

797
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,080
so

798
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,159
yeah maybe sit on it for a while and

799
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,279
whether http or tls i think it's i think

800
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,880
in the discussions i had before it was

801
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,720
is basically wherever the implementers

802
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,039
are i don't think it matters terribly i

803
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,480
i assume you get across a review in

804
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,640
either case so

805
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,840
one of those two

806
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,360
okay thank you php

807
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,000
hi yes um

808
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,480
i've tried to do simla

809
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
and one of the things i've noticed

810
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,720
is

811
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,080
uh well

812
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,679
i i i've having tried to do what

813
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,440
steven's trying to do

814
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,360
i've i've got some problems with the way

815
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,600
that he's trying to do it i think that

816
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,440
this might be a bit more complicated

817
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
than uh

818
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,559
is being made out

819
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,720
basically what you need to do is to

820
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,640
have a

821
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,440
credential for the host

822
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,360
rather than the

823
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,080
service running on the host

824
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,519
and so

825
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,720
uh you might be able to do it in tls

826
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,240
uh it might be a different working group

827
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,840
of its own it

828
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,720
it is quite a complicated piece of uh

829
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,559
issue

830
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,320
and i don't think that it fits into the

831
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,960
way that we've been solving this

832
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,440
doing tls and http in the past

833
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
i think that we've got to revise some of

834
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,320
that

835
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,279
i think we've also got to step back and

836
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,559
rethink some of the ways that we use dns

837
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,000
and how

838
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,360
srv records are used in dns

839
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,560
so

840
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,000
[Music]

841
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,080
it may be tls or it may be a separate

842
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,639
working group

843
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,080
so uh philip do you think that this is a

844
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
more general problem

845
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,240
or

846
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,080
oh yes

847
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,200
yes basically what we have lacked in

848
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,640
ietf

849
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,880
for 20 years now

850
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,960
is a generic way of service of secure

851
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,039
service discovery

852
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,399
in that if you want to talk to

853
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,559
internet protocol

854
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,559
named fred

855
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,720
there should be a way of

856
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,360
finding the hosts that you want to talk

857
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,840
to that is the ip addresses

858
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,880
the protocols that you want to talk to

859
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,399
the versions

860
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,960
the tls

861
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,440
parameters etc

862
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,559
we should have that stuart cheshire did

863
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,840
some of that

864
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,640
with his dns discovery piece

865
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,799
uh but that's not a um

866
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,919
that's only

867
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,200
one option

868
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,799
this is something that we should have

869
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,360
done as an itf wide resource that

870
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,399
everybody is encouraged to use

871
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,840
um 20 years ago and it should

872
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
uh subsume well known

873
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,279
and all that stuff as well because

874
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,840
if we were to produce ourselves

875
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,040
a version of http over quick or

876
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,679
something like it specifically for web

877
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,480
services that's not trying to also serve

878
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,359
uh

879
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,960
your web browser

880
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,679
we would probably break out instead of

881
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,079
using dot well known we would break that

882
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,320
out into a separate service um

883
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,000
layer where you would say i want to talk

884
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,280
to this service at this dns address

885
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,239
rather than uh i talked to a reserved

886
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,320
urls because you know the your reserve

887
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,000
urls are flaky it was always a hack so i

888
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,839
i think that what we really need to do

889
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,239
is to do that general uh

890
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,839
service discovery

891
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,079
okay thank you very much php a few of

892
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,960
you um it's well noted we'll just see

893
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,320
that we've got a few people in the queue

894
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,879
so we'll race through those

895
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,560
at this point and then yeah um we'll

896
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,320
just sort of close it and maybe invite

897
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,000
francesca to come with a summary at the

898
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,800
end as well from her point of view um so

899
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,560
rich saltz you're next in the queue

900
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,599
hi um so i

901
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,680
i come representing a cdn

902
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,160
um and i'm worried very much about

903
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,400
trying to make a general purpose

904
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,520
solution

905
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,960
this fills

906
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,520
an important point need for

907
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,000
any customer who uses a cdn which is

908
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,160
lots of sites on the net and any

909
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,040
customer who uses multi multiple cdns

910
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,480
which is still lots of sites on the net

911
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,079
we want to make it easy for them to

912
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,800
configure steven's draft also has test

913
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,839
figure test vectors

914
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,880
let's not try to solve the problem let's

915
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,200
put this point down and if it becomes

916
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,680
generalizable let's do that after we've

917
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,520
gotten the second data point we need two

918
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,760
points to draw a line segment so i'd

919
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,040
like to dispatch this perhaps to dns op

920
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,359
which is where server speed came in

921
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,520
um but

922
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,400
this draft alone is meets a real

923
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,760
pressing need in the industry thank you

924
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,040
thank you rich

925
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,599
really appreciate that okay eric you're

926
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,079
next in the queue

927
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
hello yes i i have no strong opinions

928
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,520
over whether or not this is the right

929
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,920
solution to the problems or how much the

930
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,000
problems really exist but i think if

931
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,599
this is the right solution i think we

932
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,560
need to

933
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,480
generalize it at least to the level of

934
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,240
svcb records

935
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,240
and that is because the svcb records the

936
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,079
dns records are usually used to

937
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,000
communicate at configs

938
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,560
it's a very generalized record it's

939
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,160
blocking well it's a kitchen sink key

940
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
value pair essentially so

941
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,760
if we're going to do a solution like

942
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,880
this it needs to be something that's at

943
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,119
least general to that level because

944
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,640
there could be plenty of times in the

945
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,000
future that something's added to those

946
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,400
records that needs a similar mechanism

947
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,040
to update to the zone file so

948
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,200
it's it's an extremely generalizable

949
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,720
problem and it should be generalized and

950
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,000
should be dispatched accordingly

951
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,079
thank you eric i'm hearing quite a lot

952
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,839
that this is more general problem than

953
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,720
just specific to tls um we'll just

954
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,560
invite sean turner who's next in the

955
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,799
queue

956
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,520
hi um i just wanted to say from a tls

957
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,880
working group perspective one of the

958
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,800
reasons why we weren't quite sure that

959
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
this fit is because um not everything

960
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,480
that's related to tls needs to be done

961
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,079
in the tls working group and we really

962
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,880
felt that at least as chairs that while

963
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,320
we're hugely supportive of eca esni um

964
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,760
that maybe the right people weren't in

965
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,680
the group and we've primarily tried to

966
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,320
stay focused on the tls wire format and

967
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,920
how those things uh how it gets

968
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,839
exchanged between the two peers now

969
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,599
we've not always done that but um we

970
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,800
want to make sure that the rest of the

971
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,760
world

972
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,440
learns to love security as well and how

973
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,040
it helps us do the right thing so as

974
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,480
opposed to trying to get everything done

975
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,240
in the tls working group that's fully

976
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,760
related to the tls working group we

977
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,599
could you know we can set this free and

978
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,040
get it to another set of experts who

979
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,640
might help but get better deployed

980
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,879
thanks

981
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,359
thank you sean um and we'll just invite

982
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,599
francesca as a.d to come in with final

983
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,920
thoughts

984
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,640
hello so um i haven't heard any clear

985
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,359
consensus in the discussion both in

986
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,119
jabber and in the room

987
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,599
what i've heard is that this needs a

988
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,599
working group this is probably not going

989
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,240
to go to ad sponsored

990
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,680
probably not a new working group

991
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,079
because there was yeah at least that's

992
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,520
my impression um

993
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,079
yeah i think maybe we can continue this

994
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,880
discussion in the mailing list if there

995
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
is no other

996
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,240
um

997
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,640
opinions and then

998
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,359
yeah we we will take into account

999
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,680
everything that was said anyway

1000
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,200
thank you francesca yeah i think that

1001
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,320
agrees with what we're hearing in the

1002
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
room definite interest in the work and

1003
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,240
that it should go forward but just a bit

1004
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,000
of discussion on exactly how to do that

1005
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,359
and in which group

1006
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,280
um so we'll just say

1007
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,680
and and also sorry also like not clear

1008
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,320
in which area either because yeah this

1009
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,240
is presented here but it's also related

1010
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,040
to security and yeah

1011
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
so was that discussion on dispatch

1012
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,800
mailing list

1013
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,880
yes we can keep the discussion in

1014
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,079
dispatch thank you great thank you

1015
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,040
thank you very much for presenting

1016
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,560
okay so we'll just carry on um next on

1017
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,760
the agenda

1018
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,320
we have updated use of the expires

1019
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,880
message head field

1020
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,480
so i think it's john presenting

1021
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,040
um

1022
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
do you want me to show the slides or

1023
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,640
would you or will you

1024
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
i don't i don't mind what would you

1025
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,880
prefer

1026
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,400
uh if you could that would that would be

1027
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,200
nice sure

1028
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,599
okay next slide please

1029
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,359
um the expires header has been around

1030
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,119
for decades it was def originally

1031
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,760
defined for uh message for message

1032
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,920
gateways from x 400

1033
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
and for those of us still on usenet it's

1034
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,079
fairly heavily used and used in usenet

1035
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,200
messages

1036
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,599
which is how i bumped into it

1037
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,160
next please

1038
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,280
um so our proposal is extremely simple

1039
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,319
um is is basically to re rehabilitate

1040
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,760
this header with the same syntax and the

1041
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,880
same meaning

1042
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,960
but to but to change the rule so instead

1043
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,880
of just being for x 400 gateways of

1044
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,240
which there are not a whole lot these

1045
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,200
days

1046
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,440
that it's allowed in any email message

1047
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,960
and i have some possible uses but

1048
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,440
typically it's it's if a message has

1049
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,240
if if the contents of a message is of

1050
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,079
has a time limit on it this says what

1051
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,000
the time limit is so that your mail your

1052
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,680
mail software could do something

1053
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,119
reasonable to get rid of it but it's no

1054
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,800
longer interesting

1055
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,839
uh next please

1056
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,880
so um yeah i've already gone back and

1057
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,200
forth with brian a little bit on this um

1058
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
we have learned not to attempt to tell

1059
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,319
mail software how to how to speak to

1060
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,640
how to speak to users so our proposal

1061
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,160
says nothing about what a user agent

1062
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,319
would do but since everybody asks

1063
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,240
um it can do everything from what it

1064
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,160
does now just to ignore it

1065
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,240
um or to gray them out or automatically

1066
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,920
delete them or let the user

1067
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,880
let the users delete them um but again

1068
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,079
um

1069
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,640
in in use that this is pretty i mean

1070
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,359
the

1071
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,359
the semantics are a little different but

1072
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,960
but it seems it doesn't seem hard to

1073
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,240
implement

1074
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,200
uh next please

1075
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,280
so how to dispatch it

1076
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,800
and uh i should have updated this a

1077
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,520
little bit um the the the the

1078
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,119
the short version of this is whatever we

1079
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,280
do with the on philippe's um

1080
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,599
draft um we should probably do we should

1081
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,720
probably do the same thing with this

1082
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,040
draft um

1083
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,640
it's a small change

1084
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,520
um

1085
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,319
it's

1086
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,920
you know it's a it's another email

1087
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,119
header

1088
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,160
and that's it for my slides

1089
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
okay so we just invite comments at the

1090
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,040
queue and i can see alexia in the queue

1091
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,000
hi john

1092
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,880
um

1093
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,240
yeah i like it uh actually

1094
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,720
i represent uh

1095
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,280
a vendor who implemented this in x400

1096
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,200
but i actually have it also used in

1097
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,560
internet mail

1098
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,839
in our webmail client so

1099
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,160
um that sounds very sensible

1100
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,119
to do

1101
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:33,920
with

1102
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,000
i was actually surprised that it was uh

1103
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,319
not defined one for internet mail other

1104
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,640
than for gateways so

1105
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,880
make sense um

1106
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,880
don't really have an opinion about where

1107
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,560
to do it

1108
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:46,840
um

1109
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,929
[Music]

1110
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,000
i mean email call might potentially be a

1111
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,440
candidate

1112
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,839
if yeah

1113
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,119
email core has enough trouble doing what

1114
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,119
it's already charted to do no i know it

1115
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,640
yeah yeah

1116
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,960
um

1117
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,480
yeah

1118
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,640
and uh creating its own email working

1119
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,560
group

1120
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
murray actually started a private

1121
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,400
discussion with some people about this

1122
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,319
and

1123
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,560
it's

1124
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,040
complicated think that's it

1125
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,599
okay thank you very much um next in the

1126
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,040
queue we have sean turner

1127
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,800
yeah hi i was gonna say that there there

1128
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,560
isn't much um

1129
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,880
you know dispute about this and usually

1130
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,000
i think the male community is pretty uh

1131
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,599
voiceful when something gets uh

1132
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,280
suggested that's really crazy and if

1133
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,359
this isn't can we just ad sponsor it and

1134
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,839
get it done

1135
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,400
i mean john you foresee any like you

1136
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,079
said it was a little change alexis said

1137
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,319
maybe it was a little complicated but is

1138
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,000
it really and if it's not

1139
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,880
can we just do it

1140
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,040
yeah i i don't expect this to be

1141
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,720
to be um

1142
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
contentious i mean as alexis said people

1143
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,160
act like he said like he didn't know he

1144
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,520
he didn't realize that he wasn't

1145
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,800
supposed to use it anyway so

1146
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,520
what it means

1147
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,040
okay thank you we'll carry on down the

1148
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,640
queue um so next michael

1149
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,280
hello uh just a word of support for this

1150
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,839
because uh i know of at least one very

1151
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,599
big implementation of something similar

1152
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,520
that doesn't follow any standards or it

1153
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,440
has you know uses some different headers

1154
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,119
i think it would be great to have a

1155
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,520
standardized way of

1156
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,920
well of doing that

1157
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,200
rather than vendors doing their own

1158
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,439
thing

1159
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,400
okay thank you for expressing support

1160
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,160
for the work um rohan

1161
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,040
yeah i think it's i think it's useful

1162
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,359
and i actually referenced

1163
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,920
i referenced it in the work that i did

1164
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,040
which is coming up next

1165
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,720
and do you have a view on the dispatch

1166
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,599
question

1167
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,880
rohan how it should go forward

1168
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,560
uh not particularly

1169
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,359
okay so i've heard so far um

1170
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,599
we're definitely not email core although

1171
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,079
on the on the slide there's a suggestion

1172
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,079
of ad sponsorship

1173
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,760
just want to check if there's any

1174
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,480
violent disagreement to ad sponsorship

1175
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,160
does it require a bit more discussion

1176
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,440
than that or do you think that's an

1177
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,839
acceptable route so if you have any

1178
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,960
objections to ad sponsorship then please

1179
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,119
join the queue and express your view and

1180
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,440
express why and an alternative route

1181
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,440
please

1182
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,319
okay hearing nothing and after plentiful

1183
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,800
silence we'll take that dispatch outcome

1184
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,200
as a.d sponsorship thank you very much

1185
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,720
john for presenting

1186
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,839
great to see you

1187
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,640
okay so we'll carry on with our agenda

1188
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,640
and rohan it's actually you next um

1189
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,760
would you like me to share the slides

1190
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,440
for you or would you like to drive your

1191
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,440
own

1192
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,440
if you could drive that would be great

1193
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,480
thank you sure absolutely

1194
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,040
there you go take it away

1195
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,359
all right hi good morning

1196
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,598
uh

1197
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,000
all right uh i'm rowan may it's been a

1198
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,680
while since i've uh

1199
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,800
since i've been to an itf meeting

1200
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,680
next slide please

1201
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,240
so for those who are not familiar with

1202
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,119
it

1203
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,560
mls is the messaging layer security

1204
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,200
protocol it's being worked on in the sec

1205
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,520
area in the mls working group

1206
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,880
it's an efficient group keying protocol

1207
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,119
so

1208
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,359
as

1209
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,839
joiners and

1210
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,640
levers are processed in a group

1211
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,680
when you

1212
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,839
encrypt a message for a group it goes to

1213
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,799
the current members

1214
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,800
this work was strongly motivated by

1215
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,640
folks who are doing group chat

1216
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,240
applications or instant messaging

1217
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,520
applications

1218
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,280
that want uh efficient group security

1219
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,760
uh using security properly properties

1220
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,920
that are similar to the double ratchet

1221
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,400
protocol that's used in signal telegram

1222
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,599
whatsapp

1223
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,480
wire

1224
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,160
and i'm sure

1225
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,880
dozens of others

1226
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,480
so while though

1227
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,000
while the working group

1228
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,800
while the protocol itself is not at all

1229
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,960
restricted to

1230
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,319
uses for

1231
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,559
group chat or instant messaging

1232
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,200
it is uh

1233
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,280
a lot of the community which which

1234
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,680
formed in order to create to make to

1235
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,559
make that work happen

1236
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,240
came from that

1237
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,960
came from that space

1238
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,440
interestingly the folks that are

1239
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,520
participating in the mls working group

1240
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,960
they are

1241
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,559
largely from the security side and there

1242
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,480
is not a lot of what i would call the

1243
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,760
traditional itf apps area

1244
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,319
or the apps part of art

1245
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,520
folks that are involved

1246
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,880
um and important to note is that

1247
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,720
as with uh

1248
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,680
as with most itef protocols the idea is

1249
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,200
that you want

1250
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,680
an mls group to be able to

1251
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,839
contain participants from multiple

1252
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,599
domains so

1253
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,720
this would we would call this

1254
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,319
we would use this in a federated

1255
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,559
environment so we could have multiple

1256
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,960
domains simultaneously involved

1257
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,920
so mls is got uh currently multiple

1258
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,480
independent implementations and

1259
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,559
uh i think the

1260
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,400
it's no secret that we're preparing for

1261
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,040
a working group last call take a moment

1262
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,599
next slide please

1263
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,000
so because of the

1264
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,960
origin or the initial focus being

1265
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,280
largely on

1266
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,720
instant messaging and group chat

1267
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,720
applications

1268
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,520
as soon as you have a federation then

1269
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,160
then customers and vendors immediately

1270
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,319
start to think about well how do we have

1271
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,200
interoperability of

1272
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,119
of these

1273
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,359
multiple vendors multiple systems that

1274
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,200
are connected together

1275
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,880
and

1276
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,880
because the

1277
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,559
because mls is specifically about

1278
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,160
encrypting

1279
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,800
the application data

1280
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,800
we need a common format and a way to

1281
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,200
negotiate it because we cannot just do a

1282
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,760
gateway that translates the content from

1283
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,720
one format to another

1284
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,040
so the good news is is that

1285
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,000
back in uh the early 2000s

1286
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,599
uh we already

1287
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,280
discussed this problem

1288
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,079
at length and we came up with the common

1289
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,240
presence and instant messaging format

1290
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,000
cpim

1291
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,040
and that's

1292
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,720
that partially addresses this problem

1293
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,480
at the time the goal was to have just

1294
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,599
basic

1295
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,440
messages and

1296
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,400
basic presence

1297
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,440
since then the industry has moved on and

1298
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,240
what you could consider to be common

1299
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,559
features of an instant messaging service

1300
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,280
have uh expanded rapidly and

1301
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,880
are you know there

1302
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,960
are dozens of features which are

1303
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,640
implemented

1304
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,920
in uh

1305
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,160
in multiple products

1306
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,359
uh

1307
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,319
but mostly the

1308
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,160
the assumptions about what it means to

1309
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,119
have end and security has changed uh mls

1310
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:18,000
looks very different than s mime or pgp

1311
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,280
so

1312
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,839
next slide please

1313
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,200
so i wrote a couple drafts

1314
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,119
the first one

1315
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,030
was to

1316
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,119
[Music]

1317
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,400
allow

1318
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,000
mls groups and

1319
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,280
and members of mls groups to negotiate

1320
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,480
the content uh using mime of course

1321
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,200
so uh right now the base mls protocol

1322
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,119
does not contain any way to specify the

1323
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,359
format of its application data

1324
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,359
i think this is a bit unusual for an itf

1325
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,319
protocol i think most itf protocols

1326
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,119
they specify

1327
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,119
what the format of the next layer is or

1328
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,839
they provide some other way of

1329
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,079
determining what the content of the next

1330
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,079
layer is mls doesn't have that

1331
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,920
we also need

1332
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,160
a way for

1333
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,000
a client to specify what they support

1334
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,119
so

1335
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,359
in the draft here i um

1336
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,599
there's an mls key package extension

1337
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,760
that allow that will allow clients to

1338
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,359
list

1339
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,119
mime types they support

1340
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,319
and then finally inside of a group a

1341
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,359
group info extension

1342
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,760
that allows uh

1343
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,680
the administrator of group to say which

1344
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,880
mime types

1345
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,400
must be understood in order to

1346
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,160
participate in the group and other mime

1347
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,880
types could still be sent but they

1348
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,160
would be

1349
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,559
they would be ignored if they were

1350
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,240
received by a client that didn't support

1351
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,240
them

1352
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,720
so the first question here is

1353
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,280
do we think this negotiation work is

1354
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,800
useful and

1355
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,040
if so where should it live

1356
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,640
mls has been pretty laser focused on

1357
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,040
the mls protocol and

1358
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,960
the mls architecture and federation

1359
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,960
documents are next up

1360
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,839
in the docket and as i said they don't

1361
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:21,200
have a lot of traditional application

1362
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,920
experience

1363
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,160
should i should i

1364
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,400
should we stop and ask this question or

1365
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,079
christy or should i

1366
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,280
i do my my last slide um do the last

1367
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,359
slide yeah maybe just do the last one

1368
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,319
and then we'll

1369
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,720
move on to the question

1370
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,960
next slide please

1371
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,000
okay

1372
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,800
and then um i wrote another another

1373
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,599
document to provide more of an example

1374
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,200
than anything else

1375
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,319
for

1376
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,960
a an example of a common

1377
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,839
uh protocol how you could convey

1378
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,480
the semantics

1379
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,040
so plain text and rich text messages

1380
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,319
replies

1381
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,720
reactions mentions

1382
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,400
editing and deleting previously sent

1383
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,079
messages expiring messages

1384
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,240
for our previous

1385
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,359
our previous presentation

1386
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,400
all of these features

1387
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,359
were

1388
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,480
fairly straightforward to

1389
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,720
um

1390
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,839
to provide a format

1391
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,920
that uses a bunch of existing

1392
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,760
specifications and semantics that we

1393
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,680
already have lying around in itf uh

1394
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,040
and

1395
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,520
just to note that the the goal here was

1396
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,680
not to define the way

1397
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,599
that everybody will go and do this and

1398
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,440
this becomes a

1399
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,119
you know a format that

1400
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,160
that everybody adds their features onto

1401
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,960
it's more of a

1402
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,040
goal to have a common

1403
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,079
uh

1404
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,319
a common format

1405
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:07,280
and allow vendors to negotiate different

1406
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,559
fancier or more proprietary formats

1407
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,920
possibly

1408
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,119
multiples of these in the same mls group

1409
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,960
so again

1410
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,640
trying to gauge the level of interest

1411
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,240
and

1412
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,640
where we would go and solve this problem

1413
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,920
if we want to work on it

1414
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,240
okay so perhaps now we'll take um views

1415
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,799
from the mic line

1416
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,720
so yes if you can say your name before

1417
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,480
you speak as well that'd be great harold

1418
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,680
yeah hello strong

1419
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,680
i am a bit worried about whether we are

1420
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,839
attacking the red problem of course

1421
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,119
because

1422
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,960
having the

1423
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,599
ability to know what

1424
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,760
the format of the content you're sending

1425
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,079
is useful

1426
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,920
but that doesn't mean that you

1427
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,880
understand the semantics of it

1428
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,400
the semantics are very often

1429
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,319
a bit complex to specify and especially

1430
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,839
a bit complex to make

1431
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,559
interoperable

1432
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,799
i'm

1433
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,359
i've got scars from having dealt with

1434
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,760
messaging and conferencing systems in

1435
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,839
the past

1436
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,280
and they seem to have announced the

1437
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,799
tendency to

1438
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,160
devolve into little islands of their own

1439
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,839
they don't talk to each other very well

1440
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,880
and semantics of gateways are

1441
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,720
even more horrible than semantics of

1442
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,079
gateways in

1443
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,960
email systems

1444
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,480
so

1445
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,119
i would say that this is useful but

1446
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,559
perhaps not as useful as

1447
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:55,839
that

1448
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,760
defining the

1449
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,280
syntax of messages is

1450
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,760
probably useful but not as useful as as

1451
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,200
it could be

1452
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,200
in that we have

1453
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,559
semantics of messages which goes to

1454
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,480
the semantics of the context that you're

1455
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,240
dealing with

1456
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,400
and that's a real pain

1457
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,000
to get stannis working for

1458
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,799
so

1459
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,400
i'd like to hear your opinion your

1460
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,960
thoughts about

1461
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,319
yeah i agree semantics is always has to

1462
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,440
come first

1463
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,200
and uh

1464
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,040
the important thing

1465
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,359
is that we

1466
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,480
if we if we define a common format we're

1467
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,599
just saying

1468
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:40,400
these

1469
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,720
these are the semantics

1470
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,160
uh for this particular syntax um

1471
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,960
i don't think that we want to

1472
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,480
um

1473
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,520
that we want

1474
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,480
to to for example the example of

1475
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,200
what you do with an expiring message

1476
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,359
in

1477
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,400
we don't want to say exactly how you

1478
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,000
would render this to the user but we

1479
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,480
want to say what does it mean uh

1480
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,520
i'll pass to uh to richard

1481
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,280
okay richard

1482
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,480
hi thanks

1483
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,520
am i audible here

1484
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,640
thanks

1485
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,480
so yeah rowan thanks for putting this

1486
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,160
together i think this i think you you've

1487
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,520
caught on to a good problem here but i

1488
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,520
think this document set is probably a

1489
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,359
bit immature

1490
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:32,720
um like

1491
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,319
i think really what what you're

1492
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,079
proposing to tackle here is basically

1493
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,480
making another path at doing an ietf

1494
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,160
messaging protocol

1495
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,880
which is kind of exactly as big of a

1496
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,240
problem as it sounds but i think we've

1497
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,280
got the tools today

1498
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,000
to to have a chance of applause of that

1499
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,680
being a yes thing where we have a

1500
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,520
plausible chance of success

1501
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,000
um so on the one hand i think this is a

1502
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,280
bigger problem

1503
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,359
uh a bigger challenge than then one

1504
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,720
might get the impression of looking at

1505
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,640
the documents um but on the other hand i

1506
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,000
think we've got a good chance of success

1507
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,559
we have as you say mls here is a tool

1508
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,200
for intent security and we've got

1509
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,440
some experience out in the industry uh

1510
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,559
doing end-to-end security uh with uh in

1511
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,079
some real systems

1512
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,520
um

1513
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,839
and i think there's a variety of reasons

1514
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,440
out there in the world that people want

1515
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,839
to do interop so i think we've got

1516
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,040
those reasons i think we have a fair

1517
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,359
chance of doing an interoperable

1518
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,160
end-to-end secure messaging solution um

1519
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,160
kind of along the lines of cpim or

1520
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,640
jabber the prior efforts but

1521
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,040
now with kind of more modern stuff uh

1522
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,480
more modern foundations more modern

1523
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,760
features so

1524
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,839
um all that said i think we probably

1525
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,240
need to do a buff on this um i think we

1526
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,280
probably need to do a little bit more

1527
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,040
community building and have some more uh

1528
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,400
you know more of those messaging

1529
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,160
operators in the room um

1530
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,000
besides you and me and i'm not seeing

1531
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,400
anyone else uh in the room i think in

1532
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,599
the cube

1533
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:56,640
um

1534
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,079
i think it's gonna be important to have

1535
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,680
you know feedback on that process from

1536
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,040
um you know multiple of the uh

1537
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,400
potential participants in an

1538
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,000
interoperable ecosystem to make sure

1539
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,280
that we're we're hitting the right

1540
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,799
feature set we're getting the security

1541
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:11,599
right

1542
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:12,640
um so

1543
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,160
yeah in summary you know important

1544
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,839
problem but let's do a baffledness

1545
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,520
instead of uh advancing these documents

1546
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,599
directly

1547
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,440
okay thank you richard so we had a

1548
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,160
recommendation for a buff from you

1549
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,160
okay um

1550
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,599
philipp hall and baker oh rohan sorry

1551
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,000
quick question so um

1552
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,400
i because there are two documents here

1553
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,559
one which is about negotiating

1554
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,119
uh content types and the other which is

1555
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,559
a content type

1556
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,880
um i think richard most seems like he

1557
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,400
was mostly speaking about the content

1558
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,440
type but

1559
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,680
for anybody who's uh who's speaking

1560
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,000
please say

1561
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,839
which one you're speaking about or or

1562
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,280
both

1563
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,000
and just jumping back in here um on the

1564
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,920
i was primarily addressing the inmate

1565
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,760
content um the

1566
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,480
the inner content type extension um i

1567
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,079
could probably be comfortable

1568
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,920
dispatching mls it's a really

1569
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,640
straightforward thing um

1570
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,319
might benefit from some more app area

1571
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,160
attention but um

1572
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,559
could go either way

1573
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,480
thanks

1574
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,480
yeah thank you for the clarification

1575
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,760
um php or next

1576
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,040
yeah um yeah i i'm finding it

1577
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,559
interesting

1578
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,200
uh my problem is similar to that of

1579
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,280
richards but

1580
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,200
i'm coming it from it from the other

1581
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,599
point of view i mean like yeah with the

1582
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:36,720
itf

1583
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,319
we're supposed to be doing stuff that

1584
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:42,240
interoperates for the end user

1585
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,520
this has all messaging for some reason

1586
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,319
we seem to like walled gardens

1587
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,480
i did not like the fact that we started

1588
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,040
up mls the way that we did

1589
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,680
with a permission given to walled

1590
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,359
gardens

1591
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:00,079
with this basically we're saying we're

1592
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,920
going to do an interoperable messaging

1593
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,200
system

1594
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
without doing an interoperable messaging

1595
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,599
system

1596
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,240
so i i can't see how you could do an

1597
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,599
interrupt

1598
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,720
unless person using service a can

1599
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,359
actually interrupt with person using

1600
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,520
service b

1601
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,559
and so

1602
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,520
this is kind of like incoherent to me

1603
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,920
either you decide to do

1604
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,000
an interoperable

1605
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
messaging system in which case this

1606
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,440
stuff is relevant

1607
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,200
or you continue to do proprietary

1608
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,760
systems that don't talk to each other in

1609
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,760
which case this isn't

1610
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,920
something that we should spend time on

1611
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,359
so i would support doing a buff on this

1612
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,039
but i i don't see that we should have

1613
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,400
itf time being spent on anything that is

1614
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,520
not

1615
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,920
an interoperable system from the point

1616
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,880
of view of the actual users

1617
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,160
not the companies not the businesses the

1618
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,839
users unless alice can talk to bob

1619
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,720
using a different vendor's service

1620
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,599
it's not worth our time

1621
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,960
okay thank you php um well noted and so

1622
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,880
ahead support for the buff

1623
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,520
only if it's true interoperability we'll

1624
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,359
go through the cues quite a few people

1625
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,200
so we'll just kind of keep it brief if

1626
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,160
we can

1627
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,520
martin thompson you're up next

1628
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,640
so um

1629
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,440
i think

1630
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,880
rowan i think this is a problem that i

1631
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,119
would like to see us working on at some

1632
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,680
level uh one thing that i sort of found

1633
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,680
missing in your presentation and it's

1634
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,920
pretty hard to pick up from the drafts

1635
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,359
is how you imagine

1636
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,920
the um the use of the keys that come out

1637
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,520
of mls

1638
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,640
one of the things that we're discussing

1639
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,920
in s frame with the mls usage there is

1640
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,760
use of an exporter i imagine that you're

1641
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,839
talking about the internal keys for mls

1642
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,119
being used

1643
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:56,960
and i don't quite understand how you are

1644
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,280
managing diversity of

1645
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,280
ensuring that

1646
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,880
you have the sequence numbers correct

1647
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,720
and all those sorts of other things

1648
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,720
so um

1649
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,760
probably

1650
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,839
another

1651
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:12,960
recommendation off so that we can go

1652
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,160
through some of those

1653
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,400
uh how this how this all sort of fits

1654
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,440
together

1655
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,920
because uh

1656
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,760
with richard going so high level i have

1657
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,400
no idea

1658
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,880
yeah um

1659
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,000
so there

1660
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,079
there is the

1661
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,720
there is the content of the

1662
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,920
uh

1663
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,520
application data which just gets

1664
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,839
encrypted and sent to every member of

1665
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:40,799
the group

1666
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,359
uh which

1667
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,680
you've got to do something with that and

1668
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,920
so you don't require an exporter for

1669
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,559
that um

1670
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,640
as soon as you start to do things with

1671
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,960
exporters then i think it's even more

1672
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,200
important to have the exporter name be

1673
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,720
standardized and the semantics of that

1674
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,439
be standardized

1675
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,720
great thank you um so we'll just keep

1676
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,640
going down the queue before we do just

1677
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,760
note that there has been a lot of

1678
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,839
support for a boss in jabba lots of plus

1679
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,839
ones so if anyone

1680
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,119
feels strongly there shouldn't be a buff

1681
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,559
then please do bring that view to the

1682
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,280
mic over to francesca

1683
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,280
so relaying a comment from benjamin

1684
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,359
schwartz why is this described as being

1685
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:25,119
like mime instead of alpn

1686
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,119
and maybe before you answer that also

1687
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,480
with adhd on

1688
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,039
so people are supporting both is that

1689
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,960
working group forming or would that be

1690
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,200
like non-working reforming just to start

1691
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,480
a discussion

1692
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,200
and we can take that also in jabber or

1693
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,919
on the mailing list

1694
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,960
yeah in terms of

1695
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,720
mime versus lpn i think it's

1696
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,039
it really is

1697
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,200
i was envisioning multiple mime types

1698
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,680
and you know if you want to support

1699
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:04,399
a different format or a different uh

1700
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,000
a different uh a format for video or

1701
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,920
what have you i mean it

1702
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,079
i think the semantics of mime really do

1703
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,039
fit very well

1704
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,520
and uh robert you haven't added yourself

1705
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,920
to the uh to the

1706
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,640
uh the queue

1707
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,640
great yeah colin off you go you are

1708
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,960
muted though we can't hear you

1709
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,319
colin unmute yourself

1710
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,079
okay that was not pilot error um so am i

1711
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,440
unmuted this time

1712
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,280
yeah we can hear you okay

1713
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,359
so um look i i think there's a really

1714
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:47,359
good problem i i i'm interested in the

1715
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,280
high level problem here and i i want to

1716
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,799
speak in favor of this to it to a

1717
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,559
certain degree and try and think say

1718
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:53,920
what i think the problem is we need to

1719
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,039
solve and

1720
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,119
in terms of email

1721
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,520
uh it just as an analogy to think about

1722
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,280
this i think we need to solve you know

1723
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,680
the smtp problem how these various im

1724
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,079
services move the data between each

1725
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,640
other not how they actually get you know

1726
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,559
not the imap problem of how they get the

1727
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,400
data down to their actual clients and

1728
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,960
how their clients render it and there's

1729
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,400
been lots of companies that do this i

1730
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,440
mean all the major uh im systems and you

1731
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,200
know my i'm sure the bottom of all of

1732
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,720
our notebook computers right now like

1733
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,640
have like 20 different im systems that

1734
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,400
we all are forced to use and the its

1735
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,280
adding one more right m.i.o and there's

1736
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,720
lots of services that gateway those

1737
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,640
together today but none of them can work

1738
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,960
with end-to-end and there's a real need

1739
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,559
for end-to-end encryption we're seeing a

1740
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:39,920
real grow in in the space uh in the i am

1741
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,599
in the messaging space of systems that

1742
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,200
will provide that today and a need for

1743
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,359
them and a desire for them so i think

1744
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,640
there's really

1745
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,440
you know we i think you can use mls to

1746
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,839
key things into end but that means all

1747
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,760
of our current gateway technologies that

1748
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,960
have been used which weren't

1749
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,200
standardized or just implemented um

1750
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,119
don't work anymore so i i really think

1751
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,720
that we do need to solve this problem of

1752
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,319
how we can get these messaging systems

1753
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,720
to send messages to each other and with

1754
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,960
end-to-end and as soon as we have that

1755
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,559
we have to agree on what's inside the

1756
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,359
end-to-end um so i'm a big favor of this

1757
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,200
uh very supportive of doing a buff on

1758
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,240
this

1759
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,640
but i also think that we are moving way

1760
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,359
too slowly in this space and um that you

1761
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,359
know so i would definitely argue for you

1762
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,600
know let's do um

1763
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,920
an interim virtual buff uh preferably

1764
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,520
working group forming preferably

1765
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,198
sometime soon but we don't have to be

1766
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:31,198
gated by we're going to do a buff at the

1767
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:32,479
next meeting and then another working

1768
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,000
group forming off at the meeting after

1769
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,679
that and maybe a year and a half from

1770
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,279
now we might start doing the work in a

1771
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,399
working group that's just not a good

1772
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,839
timeline

1773
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,279
that's it thanks

1774
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,359
thank you cullen and we'll just cut the

1775
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,600
queue after pete you get the final word

1776
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,040
before we dispatch

1777
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,040
it's pete resnick

1778
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,279
so i want to agree with cullen working

1779
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,279
group forming buff as soon as possible

1780
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,640
on this

1781
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,319
and a working group forming buff can

1782
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,960
decide that particular pieces might go

1783
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,120
over to mls particular pieces might be

1784
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,279
in the new working group that's fine

1785
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,839
um

1786
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,600
the question of

1787
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,600
you know the semantics i think it's

1788
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,719
perfectly reasonable to define some

1789
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,040
simple-based semantics and let the

1790
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,198
industry take it on its way

1791
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:19,359
um speaking of the industry and this

1792
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,600
sort of goes to

1793
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,399
phil's point i think having players in

1794
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,479
the room that are actually working on

1795
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:27,600
the products

1796
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,359
is a fine start and we don't

1797
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,679
need the users to be the only gating

1798
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:34,399
thing

1799
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:37,120
but the question i've really got is

1800
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,679
uh who do we have who in the industry

1801
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,000
who's willing to actually say we want

1802
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,880
this

1803
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,080
um i saw in the chat room well yes and i

1804
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,839
i saw murray indicate that maybe

1805
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,920
facebook was in on this so

1806
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,198
um that that's a good sign but uh i i

1807
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:54,640
would like to hear

1808
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,800
like more people get on board with that

1809
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,040
and by the way uh hi rowan it's nice to

1810
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,440
see your smiling face for a change

1811
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,600
thank you pete nice to see you too

1812
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,920
um okay so that's the end of the queue i

1813
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,600
think we heard quite a lot of strong

1814
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,280
support and especially in jabba for a

1815
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,600
working group forming both so we'll take

1816
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,520
that forward as the dispatch outcome

1817
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,719
thank you very much everyone for your

1818
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,719
views and thank you rohan for bringing

1819
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,040
the work great to see you virtually so

1820
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,440
um we have nikita back who was earlier

1821
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,000
in the agenda and has now um come back

1822
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,800
to present on open ethics transparency

1823
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,000
protocol

1824
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,840
so

1825
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,480
um hi great we can see you nikita and

1826
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,440
just take it away

1827
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,000
hi everyone i hope i'm all the both

1828
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,120
right now

1829
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,679
um my name is

1830
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:44,320
and i'm a founder of open ethics

1831
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,120
initiative my background is in physics

1832
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,040
and neuroscience

1833
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,520
but last 15 years i've been spending in

1834
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,679
software design and development

1835
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,000
and today i would like to talk

1836
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,239
with you about open ethics transparency

1837
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:01,199
protocol which has a main

1838
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,719
idea of

1839
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,640
bringing the exchange of nutrition

1840
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,960
labels and nutrition tables to the

1841
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,560
software industry

1842
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,440
something that has happened before

1843
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,679
in the food industry and construction

1844
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,560
industry could actually be brought to uh

1845
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,159
to software and

1846
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,159
today i want to discuss and bring this

1847
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,600
to the discussion

1848
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,400
so

1849
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,320
kirsty could could you please

1850
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,880
switch to the next slide

1851
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,440
uh abstract is here uh for your

1852
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,080
information but but the idea

1853
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,600
is that

1854
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,840
we could approach uh

1855
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,199
disclosure which leads to uh nutrition

1856
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,280
labels

1857
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,040
through disclosure of the components and

1858
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,960
every component in the software it could

1859
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,800
be described

1860
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,239
using

1861
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,880
three main pillar is a decision space

1862
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,840
actually what it does

1863
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:56,719
uh the way it operates uh is it based on

1864
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,320
heuristics or

1865
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,280
machine learning based trained models

1866
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,239
and a software base whether it's an open

1867
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:07,440
source or proprietary code so let me but

1868
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,800
let me explain

1869
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,360
and show where i leave next one

1870
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,480
we have seen this before in the food

1871
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,719
industry where every product

1872
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:19,840
has

1873
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,000
obtained a label with expiry dates with

1874
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,719
barcodes for scanning and tracking

1875
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,880
the supply chain

1876
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,320
with the information about the

1877
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,080
manufacturing with the information about

1878
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,719
the recycle recycling and with the

1879
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:37,040
caloric intake in nutritional

1880
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,880
information

1881
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,360
what's interesting uh however about the

1882
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,199
what would happen in the food industry

1883
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:44,560
is that

1884
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,239
this process

1885
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:49,040
didn't happen overnight it

1886
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,360
was brought to us during the last 30

1887
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,880
years and it was first uh impris uh

1888
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,880
implemented uh or proposed in 1976 and

1889
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,560
only got mandatory in 1994 and after

1890
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,239
that we we've seen the evolution of uh

1891
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:08,560
nutrition tables and nutritional labels

1892
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,199
and next one

1893
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,840
so here you could see the links which

1894
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,840
you which you could use to

1895
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,400
um

1896
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,640
get acquainted with the with the

1897
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,800
protocol the link to the draft the link

1898
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,320
to the project page and the github uh

1899
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,000
where

1900
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,360
the main work

1901
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,360
could be extended and where you could

1902
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,480
contribute

1903
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,880
and there is also one implementation

1904
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,080
which was

1905
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,960
uh brought by open ethics label which i

1906
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,400
can show later on if we would have some

1907
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,760
a bit of time

1908
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,080
in this conversation

1909
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,040
let's go for the next one

1910
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,520
so what is happening in uh today in the

1911
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,000
software industries almost 80 percent of

1912
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,760
consumers including

1913
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,679
industrial consumers they don't know

1914
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:00,480
what is happening on the back end and

1915
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,880
only one third of companies

1916
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,440
say that they have instruments

1917
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,280
to bring either transparency

1918
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,880
information about how they treat the

1919
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,640
data how they process the data how would

1920
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,480
they transfer data

1921
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,280
to

1922
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,840
different components and what we believe

1923
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,040
is that

1924
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,760
the regulation is not the only way

1925
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,080
we could uh we could improve software

1926
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,679
quality and therefore

1927
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,840
we could improve how how people are

1928
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,040
satisfied by by using software or hybrid

1929
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,400
software hardware products but also we

1930
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,480
could do this through transparency and

1931
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,239
if we do want to

1932
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,080
do this through transparency we need to

1933
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,400
have a mechanism not only about the

1934
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,040
formats of how this data is exchanged

1935
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,920
but also about the protocol of exchange

1936
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,480
uh so here uh here i want to talk about

1937
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,080
the protocol of exchange and later on

1938
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:52,880
touch

1939
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,760
touch and formats

1940
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,960
uh the inspiration for that was brought

1941
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,600
uh from creative commons and some one of

1942
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,920
you who have ever tried to

1943
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,560
attribute your work to creative commons

1944
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,360
they have seen the

1945
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,000
a simple tool to generate the creative

1946
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,320
common license and then to plug and play

1947
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,640
this creative common license

1948
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,400
on your artwork

1949
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,640
we want to pursue the similar

1950
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,920
way of disclosure but not for licensing

1951
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,080
but for how the software is built and

1952
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:32,000
how it operates next one please

1953
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,640
so

1954
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,640
what we've built is we've built a simple

1955
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,760
form a very similar to the one that is

1956
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,000
on the creative commons website

1957
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,400
uh that construct this sort of labels

1958
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,719
but one important addition to this is

1959
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:49,679
that

1960
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,600
apart from

1961
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,960
the labels themselves we also construct

1962
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,120
a machine readable file that could then

1963
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,920
be exchanged and the idea that this once

1964
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,199
generated

1965
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,199
this machine readable file could be

1966
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,080
placed either in the root of the website

1967
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,480
of the product website or on the

1968
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,000
well-known

1969
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,280
folder

1970
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,320
of the website so that crawlers could go

1971
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,560
and screen this website and then when

1972
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,640
the contracts are established between

1973
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,239
one software component and let's say

1974
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:23,920
the client

1975
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,239
they can suck this file process this

1976
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,360
file and then reuse this file to build a

1977
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,239
composite disclosure of the a bigger

1978
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,320
software on the on the higher level next

1979
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,800
one please

1980
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,080
so this is the way how

1981
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,040
the

1982
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,360
file could look like it's a simple json

1983
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,199
structure and we aim it to become an

1984
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,679
ethics password of the product and

1985
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,840
instead of saying that

1986
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,600
the product should be

1987
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,840
should be private or the product should

1988
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,880
be

1989
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,040
safe we could introduce a very formal

1990
01:16:59,040 --> 01:16:59,920
measure

1991
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,199
of how safe or how private it could be

1992
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:04,400
which sort of

1993
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,080
information it should collect which sort

1994
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,159
of which sort of validation should

1995
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,040
happen

1996
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,360
at when the product operates and

1997
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,679
specifically for ai and machine learning

1998
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,239
products this is important as we are

1999
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,880
operating not on rules but based on the

2000
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,080
trained data where it is very difficult

2001
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,760
to understand

2002
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,640
uh

2003
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,840
and to factorize the the the outputs

2004
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,239
made by made by the machine so if we

2005
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,120
could

2006
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,840
uh take account of the training data

2007
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,080
sets and bring this trade bring this

2008
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,199
information

2009
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,679
as a passport as a data password we

2010
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,280
could then

2011
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,120
have a more clear idea about how the

2012
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,800
software is built

2013
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,520
next one please

2014
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,520
so what

2015
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,560
we

2016
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,600
propose here is that every

2017
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,719
every

2018
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:57,199
product owner or software developer

2019
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,960
creates a disclosure through a simple

2020
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,960
process either through a semi-automated

2021
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,120
process or through a fully automated

2022
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,719
process right now we have a

2023
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,560
semi-automated process only put

2024
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,159
implemented in place

2025
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,080
and what they do they do the disclosure

2026
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,320
first and then in the process of doing

2027
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,199
the disclosure the disclosure get gets

2028
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,280
that the

2029
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,000
cryptographic hash gets issued and then

2030
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,600
this hash could be compared to the

2031
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,000
content of the disclosure and generated

2032
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,040
in

2033
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,960
a very standardized way

2034
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,159
and then hash gets published uh like

2035
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,719
very similar uh to

2036
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,320
the pgp uh idea of publishing

2037
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,480
hashes of email uh

2038
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,159
pgp signatures and then someone who

2039
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:44,320
gets acquainted with the software can

2040
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,120
then

2041
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,440
take the disclosure which is published

2042
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:51,120
and then generate the pgp compare it and

2043
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,320
uh and work it with it and then we could

2044
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,880
raise level of trust to this disclosure

2045
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,320
gradually by

2046
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,719
working with a third party validation

2047
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,880
companies who could take parts of the

2048
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,840
disclosure check them and then

2049
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,560
verify them and then the final label is

2050
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,719
built on top of the machine readable

2051
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:11,840
file

2052
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,320
next one

2053
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,320
so where i think help is needed uh here

2054
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,280
are just seven elements of the which i

2055
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,440
listed and which are also published

2056
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,159
in the ie draft

2057
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,640
which are how to better manage the

2058
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,320
components and identity of the

2059
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,640
components how to manage the identity

2060
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,120
validation providers which will validate

2061
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,080
whether what is disclosed is true or not

2062
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,159
uh how to extend the disclosure formats

2063
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,400
to things which are not yet there

2064
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,560
and what are the best way to just to

2065
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,320
generate composite disclosure when we

2066
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,880
have a software that is composed from

2067
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,760
several components

2068
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,679
we need help in

2069
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:56,239
disseminating this idea and to create a

2070
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:59,280
very simple use cases which would be

2071
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,320
easy to understand

2072
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,440
we have some work done on standardizing

2073
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,400
privacy disclosure to avoid lengthy

2074
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,480
privacy policies that says

2075
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,880
that say how we collect the data how we

2076
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,880
process the data very important

2077
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,679
right now in light of gdpr and ccpa and

2078
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,159
all uh privacy

2079
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,320
regulation initiatives

2080
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,400
and of course enhancing the label

2081
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,320
accessibility because right now the

2082
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,560
label is only a visual label but we also

2083
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,800
need to take into account how this label

2084
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,880
could be also viewed and processed by

2085
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,199
those people who have limited uh visual

2086
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,960
capacity

2087
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,480
that's it and and

2088
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,440
the next slide is perhaps on

2089
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,760
where this could be done

2090
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,400
through itf here state could you please

2091
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,519
switch to a next slide

2092
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:53,679
um

2093
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:55,600
i am thinking that this

2094
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,920
work could be done through either ad

2095
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,159
sponsorship or probably through a new

2096
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,520
working group

2097
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,360
uh

2098
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,120
right now the work is published on

2099
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,120
github so all the

2100
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:10,320
discussions are very welcome as issues

2101
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,920
are commenced to

2102
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,920
existing issues and we also have a

2103
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,159
discord channel which are jet which

2104
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,239
which is general uh channel for

2105
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:21,840
discussion but there is also one for uh

2106
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,520
for otp

2107
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,679
the protocol which which i could open if

2108
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,280
you if you beat me

2109
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,040
thank you and there is also the last

2110
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,600
slide with my email if anyone wants to

2111
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,760
get in touch and

2112
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,360
great thank you very much for presenting

2113
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,440
your work nikita especially um

2114
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,440
with your current circumstances

2115
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,920
just um to say that in the jabber chat i

2116
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,600
think there's a lot of discussion about

2117
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,840
what a big problem this is and a lot of

2118
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,120
interest as well people saying it's

2119
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,600
interesting um but probably too big a

2120
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,760
problem for ads sponsorship a bit too

2121
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,480
complex and so we're just kind of open

2122
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,800
up the floor how could this proceed in

2123
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,320
ietf do you think it's an interesting

2124
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,560
problem worth working on and anything

2125
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,480
towards the dispatch question

2126
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,400
so we'll start with richard barnes

2127
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,400
nice thanks thanks for the presentation

2128
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,760
here um super simple question um

2129
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,199
you're probably aware the itf makes

2130
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,520
voluntary standards modulo that's

2131
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,719
occasionally getting picked up by

2132
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,639
regulators so one of the critical

2133
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:23,360
questions for new work is usually who is

2134
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,679
interested in taking this work up um so

2135
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,199
in addition to people you know defining

2136
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,719
this stuff we need folks to actually

2137
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:32,000
deploy it and you know use it for uh you

2138
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,080
know for its intended purposes so do you

2139
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,080
have some examples of who

2140
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,760
you know people have expressed interest

2141
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,360
in publishing these labels or consuming

2142
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,960
the data formats are actually kind of

2143
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,440
building an ecosystem here

2144
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,360
so we have started to work uh

2145
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,199
lately last year

2146
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,159
with

2147
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,719
startups and companies who were willing

2148
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:53,840
to

2149
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,440
generate those labels because they want

2150
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,239
to

2151
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,480
showcase their transparency so mainly

2152
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,719
these are small companies right now

2153
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,560
but

2154
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,120
as we planned this bottom-up

2155
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,440
we want more smaller companies to start

2156
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,280
because surface level transparency is

2157
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,400
now more

2158
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:14,000
sufficient as industry is getting mature

2159
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,760
and big companies starting to use apis

2160
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,080
from other vendors and even if their

2161
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,080
processes are transparent what is

2162
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,120
happening in a third-party api no one

2163
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,600
actually knows and this is how this is

2164
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,480
how we want to go go upper so

2165
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,600
one part another part of the answer is

2166
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,960
uh we've been presenting to the eu

2167
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,960
european tech chamber and european tech

2168
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,520
chamber is the uh also bottom up

2169
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,400
organization that works with industry

2170
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,600
companies that has showcased our ideas

2171
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,520
as the way

2172
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,800
to make

2173
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,840
ai regulation and gdpr regulation

2174
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,679
practical on

2175
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,120
not only

2176
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,120
from a legal standpoint standpoint but

2177
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,440
also from a practical standpoint because

2178
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,840
as those disclosures are made or could

2179
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,000
be made by that by companies we could

2180
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,040
get

2181
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,760
tons of open data and on the on these

2182
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,840
open data we can operate and we can

2183
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:12,719
build

2184
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:15,440
analytics that could be

2185
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,080
provided to a regulator and instead of

2186
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,639
punishing the regulator could start

2187
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,199
having another instrument not only fear

2188
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,840
as an instrument but also

2189
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,679
an education as an instrument because

2190
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,159
they can be very very targeted to those

2191
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:32,159
companies who did disclosure who

2192
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,480
volunteered to do disclosure and say

2193
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,560
look you're operating in the healthcare

2194
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,719
industry and we're seeing that you are

2195
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:41,040
transferring the data overseas

2196
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,040
with the grace period for example and

2197
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,120
this is the this is the case today

2198
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,440
already regulators are working but right

2199
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,840
now they don't have tools in their hand

2200
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,800
to be

2201
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,719
to work with many companies so we want

2202
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:53,600
to

2203
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,040
bring this tool

2204
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,120
so that the regulators could finally

2205
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,520
meet industry but not in not in the

2206
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,120
court but in a different manner

2207
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,920
great thank you and so we'll just carry

2208
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,440
on down the queue whether we've just got

2209
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,840
five minutes left on the slot so um pete

2210
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,840
resnick you're next yep this is pete

2211
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,360
reznick um

2212
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,239
so

2213
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,320
i think this is very interesting stuff

2214
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,600
and

2215
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,960
uh

2216
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,040
i i read through the draft there's a lot

2217
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,480
of pieces here

2218
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,120
and i think part of the problem is that

2219
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,800
some of them are

2220
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,400
potentially

2221
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,199
protocol or data format like technical

2222
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,360
work that we can do engineering on but a

2223
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,400
lot of them are regulators and how users

2224
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,560
are going to use this stuff and and a

2225
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,560
lot of moving pieces

2226
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,159
um so i don't

2227
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:44,159
i think if this work goes forward it

2228
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,719
would have to go forward as a buff

2229
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,000
toward working

2230
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,560
but i don't think you're

2231
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,239
at the point yet where you've pulled

2232
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,880
apart enough of the pieces so that we

2233
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,639
can see as the ietf what we would need

2234
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,120
to work on so i think there needs to be

2235
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,840
some sort of pre-work done to pull out

2236
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,719
pieces that are

2237
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,760
concrete and finite engineering problems

2238
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,239
uh the draft is a little too unwieldy i

2239
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:13,280
think to handle right now

2240
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,760
okay thank you pete so a suggestion to

2241
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,480
distill the ietf specific parts and

2242
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,560
return to that maybe with a buff um

2243
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,400
nikita if i can ask you just to mute

2244
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,000
yourself

2245
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,080
[Music]

2246
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,199
and next in the queue is patrick tarpy

2247
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:31,760
hello patrick tarpy ofcom

2248
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,440
i think it's a very interesting idea a

2249
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:37,679
couple of observations though

2250
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:41,040
it's having a unified or baseline view

2251
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,840
of what ethics looks like across

2252
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,600
the globe is

2253
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,159
challenging and what i mean by that is

2254
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,639
the idea of pii

2255
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:54,080
is established and convened in

2256
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,159
the eu region for the general data

2257
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:57,840
protection regulations but that doesn't

2258
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,159
necessarily follow suit once we leave

2259
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:01,920
the eu territory

2260
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,120
and the second

2261
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,880
and well second and third observation is

2262
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,120
that if we provide end users with

2263
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,480
information

2264
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,400
and this information is attested or

2265
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,880
verified by a third party

2266
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,679
what what's the process if the if the

2267
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:16,719
user

2268
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:18,080
says actually i don't agree with this

2269
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,280
information i think there's a problem

2270
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,239
here

2271
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:22,080
and who would pay for the third party

2272
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,280
auditing

2273
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,639
but in general i think it's a really

2274
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,280
interesting idea and i i welcome it i

2275
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,920
think anything that

2276
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,920
allows people to make informed decisions

2277
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,440
has got to be good

2278
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,199
uh from from my point of view i think

2279
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:37,120
it's a question of how can we get like a

2280
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,840
very base minimum that works kind of

2281
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,000
globally and is effective and then

2282
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,360
there's something that may be optional

2283
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,800
for particular territories that would

2284
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,639
seem to me to be a better fit but there

2285
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:48,719
you go thank you

2286
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:51,600
thank you patrick

2287
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,840
i would like to

2288
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,639
i would like to answer uh your comments

2289
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,400
i think you're

2290
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,199
nailing down a very important issue here

2291
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,840
and uh when you say about the

2292
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,840
unification of ethics this is exactly

2293
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:06,960
what we are

2294
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,480
trying to avoid

2295
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,239
and this is what is exactly what the

2296
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,840
regulation is trying to bring the

2297
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,560
regulation is trying to say that

2298
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,480
certain products must operate in a

2299
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:19,120
certain way what we want to bring is

2300
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,400
instead

2301
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,320
the description of how products are

2302
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:23,440
operating

2303
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,280
so that the user

2304
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,000
with the particular profile can have

2305
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,080
ease in selecting those products that

2306
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,880
are closer or more

2307
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,480
definite to

2308
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,440
to who they are or or what they want

2309
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:41,199
those users for example who are ready to

2310
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:44,000
compromise their privacy for safety or

2311
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,199
the other way

2312
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:46,080
uh

2313
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,920
would be still able to find the products

2314
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,080
that they're that they're aiming for

2315
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,239
now the second question is the

2316
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,880
validation verification question

2317
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,719
um

2318
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:59,199
my belief is that third-party

2319
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:02,320
verification by auditors should be paid

2320
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,040
by companies which see uh

2321
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,520
which are seeking profit uh

2322
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,400
from selling their their software

2323
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,080
on the other hand

2324
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,040
there is one project which is

2325
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,960
in the design phase which we call the

2326
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,560
big red button

2327
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,960
which is a feedback loop for the end

2328
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,600
user to have a social validation for

2329
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,480
those products which claim something but

2330
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,960
don't fulfill what they're claiming

2331
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,000
uh i hope this this answers partially

2332
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,199
your your

2333
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,520
your concern but but i i want to

2334
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,360
highlight here that we're trying to

2335
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,320
avoid universal ethics at all costs on

2336
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,840
on the other hand we want to make it

2337
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,199
open and personalized to everyone

2338
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:46,560
thank you nikita i think that's an

2339
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,280
important clarification um so just

2340
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,040
recognizing time if we can keep the next

2341
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,280
couple of comments quite quick uh ted

2342
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,120
hardy you're next in the queue uh that's

2343
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,400
hardly speaking uh thank you very much

2344
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,840
for bringing the work it's very

2345
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,320
interesting and it's indeed very broad

2346
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,760
and i think

2347
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,920
from the dispatch point of view

2348
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,600
when i look at the work and and read

2349
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,760
through some of the aspects in section

2350
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,920
four for example you touch on storage

2351
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,600
you touch on visual representation you

2352
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,719
touch on

2353
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:13,520
um

2354
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,120
what what the

2355
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,960
the different pieces would be validated

2356
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,360
for by different people it it really

2357
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,639
gives me an impression of something

2358
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,120
that's an an entire ecosystem

2359
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,440
uh in in order for it to actually work

2360
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,760
and traditionally what those do are

2361
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,520
systems engineering groups

2362
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,159
and systems engineering groups like 3gpp

2363
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:34,800
as an example define a whole release for

2364
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,880
how the whole system is supposed to work

2365
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,960
together to deliver the service to the

2366
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,239
end user

2367
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:42,239
the itf interacts with system

2368
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:43,440
engineering groups by taking

2369
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,840
requirements from them and building the

2370
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,960
different protocol elements that relate

2371
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,440
to that system engineering group and to

2372
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,440
other people who might build similar

2373
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,280
things and i think there are a bunch of

2374
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,080
things that you're actually dealing with

2375
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,560
that that might turn out eventually to

2376
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,320
be itf work you know your json

2377
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,840
application format or something like

2378
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,000
that but at the moment you're really at

2379
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,040
the level

2380
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,120
of building out the systems engineering

2381
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,800
thing and so

2382
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,560
my honest response to you from a

2383
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,800
dispatch point of view is you need to

2384
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,520
build a new group uh of people who are

2385
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,120
going to come together to define the

2386
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,800
overall system

2387
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,719
ranging through what the visual elements

2388
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:24,159
are going to look like what the

2389
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:25,600
validation is going to look like

2390
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,520
ultimately to you know what the societal

2391
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,199
pressure is going to look like when

2392
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,760
people falsify those and that group in

2393
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,520
turn can send

2394
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,760
you know the the lego piece protocol

2395
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,080
requirements to the ietf whenever it has

2396
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:38,800
them

2397
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,639
um and whenever they fall into our

2398
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:42,960
purview and not somebody else's but i

2399
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,960
think if you brought it to the ietf it

2400
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,400
would fail

2401
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,960
because this is the kind of work that at

2402
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,120
the itf would get

2403
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,360
bogged down in a whole bunch of let's

2404
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,120
talk about the protocol and not talk

2405
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,120
about the system so i think for this to

2406
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,120
succeed it really needs

2407
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,840
its own place and then that

2408
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,679
that to interact at the protocol level

2409
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,080
with with the itf when it needs to but

2410
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,760
once again it's really interesting work

2411
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,120
thank you for bringing it

2412
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,040
thank you ted yeah i think there's a lot

2413
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,480
of chat in jabber as well but it's very

2414
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,120
interesting problem and just where it

2415
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,280
may be itf is not the place but thank

2416
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,040
you um so final person in the queue

2417
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,679
leave your handsome right i'm just gonna

2418
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:23,679
quickly agree with ted and then also

2419
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:25,679
suggest that you go find there is a if

2420
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,760
you google for consent receipts you will

2421
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,520
find a group

2422
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,920
who have done very very similar things

2423
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,920
and there's a guy called mark lazar you

2424
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,520
definitely want to talk to and i think

2425
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,120
you have a lot of in common with them

2426
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,400
and those are the kind of people who can

2427
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,320
help you build that system in fact they

2428
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,159
have a quite a lot of traction for their

2429
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:45,519
stuff in the canadian government

2430
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,159
great thank you very much so um nikita

2431
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,000
we'll link up with you afterwards but

2432
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,440
for me and everyone here thank you so

2433
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,520
much for presenting especially after the

2434
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,800
morning you've had it's really great to

2435
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,960
see you here so thank you

2436
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,560
thank you

2437
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,639
so we'll move on to the art part of the

2438
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,719
agenda now um

2439
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:04,800
sorry we're still just dealing with

2440
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,960
different parts of different slide decks

2441
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,440
here we go

2442
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,480
all right well we've got this little

2443
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,320
moment as we switch things over for

2444
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,920
those of you who walked in after the

2445
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,000
meeting started there's a qr code up on

2446
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,320
the screen here or if you log into the

2447
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,880
little light meteco client then that

2448
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,560
will have you listed in the blue sheets

2449
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,159
and it's also the place that you can go

2450
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:27,360
if you want to speak in the queue thanks

2451
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,040
thank you yeah and we'll just summarize

2452
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,320
the dispatch outcomes at the end of the

2453
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,639
art area meeting as we always do

2454
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,719
so um this is just a note obviously

2455
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,400
dispatches the art

2456
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,159
in the art area and we combined with the

2457
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:40,400
art area meeting so there are three

2458
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,239
buffs this week for you to be aware of

2459
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,480
tuesday wednesday and thursday at 10 a.m

2460
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,560
how useful is that to remember when your

2461
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,320
buffs are there's computer aware

2462
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,480
networking media over quick

2463
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,159
and safnet

2464
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,239
so i'm not going to read that out um and

2465
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,760
then because it's been a while since

2466
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,760
we've had people in person or a hybrid

2467
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,920
meeting it's our first ever one just to

2468
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,320
note some of the new and nearly new art

2469
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,639
related working groups there

2470
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,719
a couple straight after this so sedate

2471
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:09,760
and wish we have mediaman on wednesday

2472
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,280
and skim and

2473
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,000
oh hey or oh hi however you say that

2474
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,080
yeah

2475
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,639
depending on how you pronounce that um

2476
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,800
so that's what we've got this week it's

2477
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,400
really good to be back in person so do

2478
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,920
go along and see the people behind those

2479
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,320
groups and get involved in person

2480
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:31,199
or virtually if you're still virtual

2481
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,360
so um we move on to the art area part of

2482
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,280
the meeting now we just have one

2483
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,400
presentation here on open event at open

2484
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,719
streaming event streaming open network

2485
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,400
oh my gosh i don't even have jet lag as

2486
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:46,320
an excuse um so we'll just hand over to

2487
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,880
emiliano to present would you like me to

2488
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,600
drive the slides

2489
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:56,639
all right first of all nice to meet you

2490
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,719
it's a pleasure to be here and today i

2491
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,960
will be presenting this event streaming

2492
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,920
open network um internet draft next

2493
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,440
slide please

2494
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:08,000
so the main problem that this internet

2495
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,560
draft is addressing is the difficulty of

2496
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,840
connecting

2497
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,440
message flows over the internet so uh

2498
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,520
with the rise of microservices

2499
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,639
architecture

2500
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:20,639
there is a need of connecting message

2501
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:23,440
flows both inside organizations as well

2502
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,520
as between organizations

2503
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,360
i think your microphone might be off if

2504
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,040
not low hello there you go you might

2505
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,239
need to make a little middle more

2506
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,560
closely

2507
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,719
like this can you hear me now

2508
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,719
all right if you can stay in it yeah

2509
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:38,400
okay perfect

2510
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,840
so i was saying that with the rise of

2511
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,560
microservices there is a need of

2512
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,360
connecting message flows both inside the

2513
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,280
organizations as well as

2514
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,760
between organizations

2515
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,000
and also end users value to be

2516
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,040
immediately aware of new information as

2517
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,040
and also companies want to provide new

2518
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:00,000
functionalities of this type

2519
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
however when we consider

2520
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,159
the connection of message flows across

2521
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,800
organizations it is not easy and most of

2522
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,440
the time it is too costly and the one of

2523
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,840
the main reason maybe uh of this

2524
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,719
difficulty is because there is no way of

2525
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:17,520
referring to message flows in the same

2526
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,360
way that we can refer

2527
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:22,080
to for instance an email address this

2528
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,400
means that there is no uri

2529
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,600
scheme for message flows

2530
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,360
and on the other side dns records um

2531
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,080
maybe they are not enough also

2532
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,440
because

2533
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,600
you know the message flows and the

2534
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,560
message

2535
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,760
brokers

2536
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,080
do not necessarily comply with the yana

2537
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,920
port number registry

2538
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,480
so the result of all this is that there

2539
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:49,199
are a lot of private solutions private

2540
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:51,040
protocols and there you can see a few

2541
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,040
maybe flight radar is one of the most

2542
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,199
known in which there are people that you

2543
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,119
know have different

2544
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:57,840
uh

2545
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,239
devices on their home scanning the

2546
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:02,239
electromagnetic

2547
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:04,880
spectrum and publishing to uh to just

2548
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,360
one company all of this information and

2549
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,440
that information keeps locked inside

2550
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,679
that company it's not possible you know

2551
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:12,560
to

2552
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,360
share those flows of messages across

2553
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:19,719
different people next slide please

2554
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,119
all right so if we drill down a little

2555
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:25,440
bit on this uh on this issue on this

2556
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,679
problem if we have two organizations

2557
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,760
that are using messages are using

2558
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,119
message flows

2559
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:34,719
um not only on a discrete form you know

2560
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:37,840
but on a streaming uh form

2561
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,000
uh whenever they want to connect these

2562
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,719
flows among themselves there are issues

2563
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:44,480
basically they need to agree on an

2564
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,280
interface they need to sit down and they

2565
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,280
need to establish a project

2566
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,040
that is going to have its analysis

2567
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,360
design and development phase

2568
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,760
in which they will agree on how to

2569
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,480
connect these message flows

2570
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,639
so whenever they need to connect a new

2571
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:02,400
flow they will have to repeat

2572
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,880
the same process and basically this

2573
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:08,400
generates a really big heterogeneity you

2574
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,159
know of

2575
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:12,159
of connections of message flows really

2576
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:13,760
difficult to maintain

2577
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,480
next slide please

2578
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,719
so if we had an open network meaning

2579
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,800
that if we could name all of these

2580
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,159
message flows with a uri in the in the

2581
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:27,360
way that you can see on this slide

2582
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,360
developers and people using this kind of

2583
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,320
messages would have a common framework

2584
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,360
to refer to these message flows it would

2585
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,679
minimize the offline communication of

2586
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:38,880
developers

2587
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,040
so today when we want to send an email

2588
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,280
to somebody we just ask for the email

2589
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,080
address we are not asking if the

2590
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,400
email if their email provider is using

2591
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,960
smtp with tls or not we just know the

2592
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,480
email address and the rest of the

2593
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,520
protocol

2594
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,679
manages to find out which is the best

2595
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,920
way to send the message so the same we

2596
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,960
could do

2597
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,119
with messages with asynchronous messages

2598
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,560
streams

2599
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,800
and we could use this same strategy for

2600
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,199
multiple integrations keeping some

2601
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:10,080
homogeneity on on how we are connecting

2602
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,920
these messages

2603
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,480
obviously this would be based

2604
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:18,320
solely on dns basically on dns so it

2605
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:19,840
would be an open network in the sense

2606
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,800
that anybody that can buy a can register

2607
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,280
a domain and can get a an internet

2608
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,639
connection could participate in the

2609
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:28,320
network without any kind of

2610
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,719
discrimination in the same way we

2611
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:32,639
currently do that for the world wide web

2612
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:33,840
and email

2613
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,920
next slide please

2614
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,159
so if we look at a high level how this

2615
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:40,239
network would look like basically we

2616
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:41,520
would have different network

2617
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,760
participants that would be enabling

2618
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,600
different message flows

2619
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,719
and

2620
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:48,639
these message flows could be both

2621
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:50,560
private or public

2622
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,360
so

2623
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,360
the messages could be

2624
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,360
composed in the sense that one network

2625
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,840
participant could use a source of

2626
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,400
message flow to enrich that information

2627
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,239
or to use it as an input for a given

2628
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:05,360
process and then publish that uh

2629
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,360
the result of that process

2630
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,520
for another network participant to to

2631
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,480
use it

2632
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,800
so this would generate a composition of

2633
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,360
the messages that would enable uh

2634
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:18,239
downstream uh productive activities and

2635
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:20,320
also give give place to a lot of

2636
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,840
experimentation

2637
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,639
let's see an example next slide

2638
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:27,040
so imagine we have an airport that has

2639
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:30,320
two terminals and this airport publishes

2640
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,920
on two different message flows the

2641
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,000
arrivals of flights

2642
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,159
and this they will do it on a public

2643
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:38,880
manner right everybody would be able uh

2644
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,119
to consume the messages as soon as a

2645
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,000
plane

2646
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,360
um

2647
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,800
uh how do you say

2648
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,800
arrives to the airport they would get a

2649
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,639
message saying okay this plane has just

2650
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:50,239
landed

2651
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:51,600
and that would be public in the same way

2652
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,679
that we can go to our website and see

2653
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:55,199
which are the planes that have landed

2654
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,440
but we are thinking about messages and

2655
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,679
programmatically connections so there

2656
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,760
could be a logistics company that could

2657
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:04,560
use this information these messages to

2658
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,880
estimate the time of arrival of a given

2659
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:07,679
good

2660
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,320
for a store and also a factory for

2661
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,000
instance

2662
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,840
and then and this connection would be

2663
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:17,520
private that i mean a confidentiality

2664
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,679
should be kept because this information

2665
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,679
it's not something that we want anybody

2666
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:23,760
to consume only these

2667
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:27,040
destinators right so but then a factory

2668
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,679
there could consume this information

2669
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:32,639
to in turn provide a car factory for

2670
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,719
instance an estimated time of arrival of

2671
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:36,239
a given piece

2672
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,960
and in turn that factory could use that

2673
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,520
information together with other messages

2674
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,080
to estimate a person when they are going

2675
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,320
to receive their new car for instance

2676
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,080
and that information wouldn't be static

2677
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,960
it would be you know updating uh

2678
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,719
according to the messages that are being

2679
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:55,360
received next slide please so let's

2680
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,440
drill down a little on the architecture

2681
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:00,159
that each network participant should use

2682
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:02,000
so here you can see a lot of boxes

2683
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,520
basically we have uh the core components

2684
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,760
of the of the network participant at the

2685
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,400
architecture with this violet purple

2686
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,920
circle

2687
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,280
and there and this is

2688
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,280
highly inspired on the email

2689
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,600
architecture so we have a user agent in

2690
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,280
the same way that in email we have a

2691
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:21,679
mail user agent and we have an accessing

2692
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:23,840
agent that would be the server side

2693
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,400
uh between these two components a

2694
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,800
protocol should be used that we have

2695
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,000
called the accessing protocol

2696
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:32,880
then

2697
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,560
the network participant could use

2698
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,880
whatever message broker that he wants i

2699
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:40,239
mean they could use rabitmq mosquito for

2700
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:43,520
mqtt server or even apache kafka apache

2701
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,800
pulsar whatever they want uh as long as

2702
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,280
the accessing agent the server side is

2703
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,320
compatible with that with that broker

2704
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,360
um

2705
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,239
and then there will be a really high

2706
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:58,639
reliance on dns in order to

2707
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:01,760
be able to resolve these flow uris

2708
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,600
and whenever a new

2709
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:07,199
uh flow is created the user agent would

2710
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,560
talk with the server side with the

2711
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,040
accessing agent a new message flow would

2712
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,080
be created on the flow events broker and

2713
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,880
also published to dns by means of

2714
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,199
dynamic dns

2715
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,280
so this is one part of the story this is

2716
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,480
only one

2717
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,880
network participant and if we look at

2718
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,199
the connection at an example

2719
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,119
of the connection between two network

2720
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:31,040
participants imagine we want to

2721
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,920
subscribe as a user i want to subscribe

2722
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,480
to our remote flow so that would be a

2723
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,760
connection between two network

2724
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,920
participants can we go to the next slide

2725
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,239
oh sorry first the protocol uh the

2726
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:46,800
protocol that the uh

2727
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,320
that the server

2728
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,400
implements we call it accessing protocol

2729
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,920
and it's really basic protocol here you

2730
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,480
can see the finite state machine of this

2731
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,800
uh of this protocol basically it

2732
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,639
supports authentication

2733
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:01,679
and also the execution of commands in

2734
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:03,840
the same way smtp does

2735
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,440
these commands would enable

2736
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,960
extensibility

2737
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:07,760
and

2738
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:10,000
um and the case that i was mentioning

2739
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,880
about subscribing to a remote flow that

2740
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,960
would be one comment it would be the

2741
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,440
subscribe comment all right so let's see

2742
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:20,400
the example next slide please

2743
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,560
so here we have two network participants

2744
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,480
the blue network participant and the

2745
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,719
orange network participant imagine i'm a

2746
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:28,960
user from the blue network participant

2747
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,520
and i want to subscribe to a remote flow

2748
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,360
to a remote message flow

2749
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:36,159
that would be flow a

2750
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:38,320
so from my user agent on the blue

2751
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:41,199
network participant i would execute a

2752
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:43,920
subscribe to a flow uri

2753
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,800
the server side would recognize that uri

2754
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,920
as a remote flow so it would resolve

2755
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,239
where the accessing agent of that flow

2756
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:54,800
is located and connect to the server

2757
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,960
once it connects and authenticates it

2758
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,360
will execute this command subscribe flow

2759
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,800
a

2760
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,600
that would trigger the creation of a

2761
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,320
flow processor on the on the orange

2762
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,159
network participant that basically would

2763
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:09,040
copy

2764
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:12,639
the uh the flow um the flow message

2765
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:15,600
right you can see there it's qeqa it

2766
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,280
would generate a copy

2767
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:19,119
and this is interesting because as a

2768
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:20,880
network participant i want to have

2769
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,280
control over my subscriptions if

2770
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:26,080
somebody is consuming messages from my

2771
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:29,440
uh from my site i mean from from from

2772
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,920
one of my users i want to eventually be

2773
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,560
able to revoke that subscription so in

2774
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,400
that case bringing down that flow

2775
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,639
processor that it's copying the messages

2776
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:40,239
would be enough to revoke the

2777
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:41,760
subscription

2778
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,920
when the subscription is established the

2779
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,080
flow processor is created a copy of the

2780
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,800
message flow is available then the blue

2781
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,320
network participant can use that

2782
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,840
information to set up a new flow

2783
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,639
processor and copy all those messages so

2784
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:57,199
now the user in the blue network

2785
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:59,600
participant would be able to consume

2786
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,320
locally uh these messages that are

2787
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,800
generated by a remote a network

2788
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,159
participant

2789
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:08,480
next slide please

2790
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,719
so the the example that i mentioned is

2791
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:13,119
the simplest one in which we have a flow

2792
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:15,199
processor that basically it's a bridge

2793
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:17,600
processor it's basically transcribing

2794
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,159
messages from one message flow to

2795
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:22,239
another one and that's a command in the

2796
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,159
protocol that it subscribed

2797
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:26,000
but there could be more advanced and

2798
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,400
complex situations in which for instance

2799
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,840
we want to collect uh messages from

2800
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,440
several flows

2801
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,600
so in that case we would execute the

2802
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:36,880
collect

2803
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,400
command and specify the source uh

2804
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,840
message flows

2805
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,159
using the flow uri

2806
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:46,480
uh and a destination flow

2807
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:48,800
uh using again the flow uri so basically

2808
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,800
this this would allow for instance in

2809
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,960
the example of the airport to collect

2810
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,199
all the arrivals of flight and publish

2811
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:58,239
them to another message flow we could

2812
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:00,560
have a distributor flow that would be

2813
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,800
basically the other way around

2814
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,199
get messages from one message flow and

2815
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:07,600
publish them to several flows

2816
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,840
and then we have maybe the most complex

2817
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,320
one that it's the sinal processor

2818
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,679
that this processor would have a

2819
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:17,280
function of a given set of input message

2820
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,840
flows and it would according to the

2821
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:20,880
function

2822
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,280
impact on one or more

2823
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:26,800
destination message flows

2824
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,119
so basically all of these uh flow

2825
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:32,080
processors would cover a broad range of

2826
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:34,320
use cases by now

2827
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,760
we have an initial proof uh of concept

2828
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,400
that has implemented only the subscribe

2829
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,560
method and we are looking forward to uh

2830
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,280
continue working on the next uh

2831
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:48,080
uh on the next comments all right

2832
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:52,080
so um we are going next slide please we

2833
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,639
are going to have a side meeting about

2834
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:56,960
this topic on wednesday i think it's

2835
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:59,440
this room actually at 4 p.m

2836
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:02,080
uh so everyone everyone is welcome and

2837
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:04,239
according to i mean regarding dispatch

2838
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:06,800
we are not sure actually how to proceed

2839
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:08,560
we believe that first of all we need to

2840
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,520
continue discussing whether uh this is

2841
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:14,000
relevant uh to be discussed within the

2842
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,639
itf we do believe so

2843
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,840
and uh and once we get you know uh some

2844
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,760
kind of feedback and if there is

2845
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:23,360
interest and if people consider that

2846
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,280
this is the place obviously we would

2847
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:28,480
like to to continue and uh and progress

2848
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,040
on on on a working group eventually who

2849
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,040
knows that's all thank you very much for

2850
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,080
your time

2851
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,400
thank you very much for presenting um

2852
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,760
really good to have the next steps if

2853
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,119
you're interested to go to the side

2854
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,679
meeting it's not this room but no just

2855
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:43,520
so just so people go to the right place

2856
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:45,280
you have interested crowds in the right

2857
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:46,960
place um would anyone like to join the

2858
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,760
queue and give a kind of initial take or

2859
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:52,800
any questions we have the time so

2860
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,520
don't be shy

2861
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,880
just wait so people have chance to click

2862
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,440
but seeing no one in the queue i can

2863
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:04,960
only assume you'll just get them all on

2864
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,560
the side meeting thank you very much for

2865
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,440
presenting thank you

2866
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,960
okay so um that actually is the end of

2867
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,199
all the planned presentations and topics

2868
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:16,960
that we had for today we just take some

2869
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,400
time to run through the dispatch

2870
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,880
outcomes from the session earlier

2871
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,280
and then we'll open up the floor for aob

2872
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,360
so uh dispatch outcomes for the

2873
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:28,320
complaint feedback loop header um it was

2874
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,760
agreed that the work should go forward

2875
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,440
possibly under a new working group for

2876
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,520
wider email maintenance if the community

2877
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,520
has interest so the creation and next

2878
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,360
steps there are to be led by murray

2879
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,040
r.a.d

2880
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:41,520
for ech config interested in the work to

2881
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,719
progress but it's not clear which

2882
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:46,400
working group so whether dns op tls http

2883
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:49,599
http biz all suggested or even the area

2884
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:51,199
whether it's art or sex so we're going

2885
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:52,880
to continue discussion on the dispatch

2886
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:55,280
mailing list to find an answer to that

2887
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,920
um updated use of the expires message

2888
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,679
header field that was recommended for ad

2889
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,840
sponsorship as someone noted in java

2890
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,040
just because it's recommended doesn't

2891
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,639
mean that it will be taken on but that

2892
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:06,880
does seem the the will of the community

2893
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,560
and then emmy was suggested to be a

2894
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,719
working group forming both and finally

2895
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:12,960
the open ethics problem nikita presented

2896
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,480
um has agreed it was really interesting

2897
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,239
work and a very good problem but a bit

2898
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:18,960
big for the ietf in its current form and

2899
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,119
so um with next steps there are to work

2900
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,520
out with the community or on the list

2901
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,440
to work out the itf specific parts of

2902
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,520
that ecosystem and bring that problem

2903
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,000
specifically back rather than the entire

2904
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,320
problem space

2905
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,440
so that's a quick run through of the

2906
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,719
dispatch outcomes we'll send them to the

2907
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:36,480
mailing list but i'll just pause in case

2908
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:39,360
there's anything that anyone um

2909
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,960
disagrees with murray's just popped in

2910
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,400
the chats a good ceremony thank you

2911
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,760
that's always a good sign when the ad

2912
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,080
agrees

2913
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,239
super

2914
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:50,639
and we'll just open up the floor then

2915
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,719
for aob if anyone has any other business

2916
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:54,080
they'd like to bring

2917
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,560
we have 10 glorious minutes

2918
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,639
francesca

2919
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:01,119
hi francesca i just wanted to

2920
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:04,639
mention that the ecmascript media types

2921
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:05,760
updates

2922
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:08,320
document there was a dispatch document

2923
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,800
has exited the working group and is with

2924
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,560
the rfc editor so

2925
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,800
just like round of applause and thank

2926
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,719
you everybody for for working on it and

2927
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,159
making the draft

2928
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:21,760
good and um progressing it and then

2929
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,679
regarding the mayo maintenance working

2930
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:25,440
group that was mentioned as as a

2931
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,800
possibility

2932
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,760
uh just wanted to say that we have uh

2933
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:33,520
mentioned it in with the isg so the ist

2934
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,760
is aware of the possibility um and that

2935
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,760
some of these email drafts might go

2936
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:38,639
there

2937
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:40,480
but we will decide based on the

2938
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,800
discussion here on the list

2939
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,719
and we'll see how that progresses so

2940
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:48,679
that's still an open option

2941
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,719
thank you very much francesca

2942
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:54,560
any other aob

2943
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,360
before we close out the session i've got

2944
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:58,320
something

2945
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,599
but i thought i'd wait for everyone else

2946
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:02,000
first um hopefully i can slide share

2947
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,800
myself here

2948
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,880
has it added or not no it hasn't i

2949
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:14,000
refreshed

2950
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,560
i refreshed in the in the view but maybe

2951
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,480
i can't refresh in this view do you want

2952
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:20,639
to talk now yeah sure can you can you

2953
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:23,199
see it says my slides in there yeah

2954
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:25,598
awesome

2955
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:31,280
so this is this is something i raised

2956
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,679
yep just go ahead to the next slide

2957
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:36,639
um three things that have come up um in

2958
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:38,159
the email space that i'm aware of one of

2959
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,560
which is dkim replay attacks are a big

2960
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:41,360
deal

2961
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,480
uh in email operations right now and the

2962
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,320
second one is

2963
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,320
if we try and solve dick and rep play

2964
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,400
attacks we'll probably break more of the

2965
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,239
indirect mail flows which means we need

2966
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:53,520
to figure out what we're going to do

2967
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:54,880
with arc

2968
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,320
to fix that

2969
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,920
and the third thing is the large files

2970
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,320
by email problem which alexi and i are

2971
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:01,679
working on and will hopefully have

2972
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:04,159
something to present at next ietf um but

2973
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:05,599
aren't really ready for yet we could go

2974
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:08,560
ahead to the next slide

2975
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:11,360
so the problem with dkim replay is

2976
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:14,159
basically that dkim specifies the

2977
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:15,679
headers inside the email but it doesn't

2978
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:18,000
specify anything about the envelope so

2979
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,719
you get one spam email successfully sent

2980
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:23,040
from a trusted provider

2981
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,840
and it's dkim signed by that provider

2982
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,040
and then you can inject that into

2983
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,679
anybody's mailbox by just changing the

2984
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:31,280
envelope recipients

2985
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:33,920
and it gets delivered to them with a

2986
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:36,639
fully signed dkim flow as if this was

2987
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:39,520
legitimately supposed to go to them

2988
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,119
that mail can come from anywhere in the

2989
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:43,360
world because if you've got dmacc that

2990
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,840
says trust spf or dkim and the dkim

2991
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,280
looks correct

2992
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,560
it passes

2993
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,320
this was a major topic at the morgue

2994
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:53,119
meeting a month ago it's a significant

2995
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:55,040
operational challenge for email

2996
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,480
providers everywhere

2997
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,080
so this is really something we do need

2998
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,119
to look at

2999
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:01,280
if we could move on to the next slide

3000
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,520
there

3001
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,840
one option is to add some kind of header

3002
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,560
that gets signed by dkim which has to

3003
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,800
align with the envelope

3004
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,480
obviously this in the past where you

3005
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,400
might send to multiple recipients with a

3006
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,440
single smtp session you couldn't do that

3007
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,360
but nobody does that anyway

3008
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:20,960
these days you wind up resending the

3009
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,960
message to each recipient possibly

3010
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:25,119
because you're changing the from address

3011
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:27,520
possibly because your mail flow system

3012
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,280
just works more easily that way

3013
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:30,639
but once you're doing that you could

3014
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:32,560
then sign the message separately for

3015
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,480
each recipient and have to align it that

3016
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:36,080
completely gets rid of this problem it

3017
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:38,000
also completely breaks all indirect

3018
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,719
email flow because if you are forwarding

3019
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:41,599
through

3020
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:44,800
an intermediate system here um

3021
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:47,280
sending to to an alias at your

3022
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,800
university or whatever then goes on to

3023
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,400
your real email address

3024
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,080
the two address changes so you have to

3025
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:54,000
rewrite the sender

3026
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,199
which gets us into arc so the next

3027
01:54:57,199 --> 01:54:59,280
slide here is yeah

3028
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:00,880
does anyone have any other suggestions

3029
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,400
for how to

3030
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,080
how to deal with that i haven't heard

3031
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,639
any that will work

3032
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:08,400
um but feel free to pop up if you have

3033
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:11,440
some so yeah arc

3034
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:14,159
the problem with arc is you don't know

3035
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:18,719
whether the recipient understands arc um

3036
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:21,199
if there's a dmacc policy which says

3037
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:23,280
that they won't accept changed mail and

3038
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:26,320
any sender that rewrites obviously can't

3039
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,639
come forward without rewriting the

3040
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:30,560
from address as well and then having to

3041
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,280
handle the backflow

3042
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,520
but if we had a header like this then

3043
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,760
this goes from being just rewriting

3044
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:40,480
forwarders to every single folder

3045
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,400
so you have to then know

3046
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:44,880
can you rewrite or not and

3047
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:46,639
without a way of knowing if i supported

3048
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,000
the recipient you have to rewrite

3049
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,840
everything so the

3050
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,760
solution for this is to have some way of

3051
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,679
knowing whether the recipient will

3052
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:55,840
accept arc

3053
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,520
and so

3054
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:59,360
this was something i raised when i first

3055
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,760
saw arc what five six years ago in

3056
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:02,960
prague

3057
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:04,719
we still need to deal with this at some

3058
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:05,599
point

3059
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:08,239
um so arc supporters here signal at the

3060
01:56:08,239 --> 01:56:09,840
recipient i think is the correct way to

3061
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:10,880
deal with this

3062
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,639
this will again be something that an

3063
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:14,480
email working group would hopefully deal

3064
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,480
with or it could be dealt with in demark

3065
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,880
but we have dmarc we have email core we

3066
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,480
have extra there's a lot of different

3067
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,880
working groups doing email related stuff

3068
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,760
and similar stuff which is is why

3069
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:27,440
i think that the

3070
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:28,880
a group that handles all of this might

3071
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,560
be the right place there's a couple more

3072
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,320
slides

3073
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:35,040
um you could add it to the smtp

3074
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,800
capabilities but

3075
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:39,440
if the mx says i accept arc

3076
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:42,719
to the hello then that's very late to

3077
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:44,960
have to actually update the message so i

3078
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,800
believe dns is probably the right place

3079
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:47,760
for this

3080
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,360
um

3081
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,520
and the other question is is whether

3082
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,440
dmacc policies need to be extended to

3083
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,280
say i don't accept being forwarded at

3084
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:57,119
all sorry

3085
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:59,040
it has you have to give me the exact

3086
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,599
destination address

3087
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,280
and that i think was everything there

3088
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:04,800
the final thing was the large file

3089
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:05,679
problem

3090
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:06,639
um

3091
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:08,719
looking at what we can do

3092
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:11,199
to to deal with a way of signaling

3093
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:13,040
this is an attachment this isn't just a

3094
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:16,080
random link in some html content

3095
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,719
so tell the recipient to you can look at

3096
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:20,400
the slides i gave it last dispatch on

3097
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,320
this rather than repeating everything

3098
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:25,040
but the important part here is lifetime

3099
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,800
management for the attached message

3100
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,239
right now i can look at an email from 10

3101
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:30,000
years ago i can see the content that's

3102
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,320
in it but if a large file was attached

3103
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:34,400
by putting a link in that email the

3104
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:36,320
likelihood that that large file is still

3105
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,880
at the same url that it was 10 years ago

3106
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:41,040
very very low which means i need to

3107
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,360
manually manage the large attachments

3108
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,360
that have been sent and that's a pain

3109
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,920
um so having a way to to link them so

3110
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:51,360
that they have a lifetime is good

3111
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:54,239
yep so we have um barry lieber joining

3112
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:55,920
the queue

3113
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:58,480
hi this is barry lieber uh formerly

3114
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,480
chaired the dkim working group

3115
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:01,599
so i just

3116
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:04,560
two things about this

3117
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:06,960
we spent a lot of time in the

3118
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:09,280
discussions on dkim both before it came

3119
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,119
to the ietf and then in the working

3120
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:14,719
group on how to deal with replay attacks

3121
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:16,560
it is a hard problem we couldn't come up

3122
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,719
with anything that was workable given

3123
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:20,639
the parameters we had

3124
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:23,199
so you're going to extend the parameters

3125
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:24,560
a bit which

3126
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:26,880
if you want to do the the recipient 2 or

3127
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,199
whatever that has a number of problems

3128
01:58:29,199 --> 01:58:31,679
including dealing with with bcc issues

3129
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:34,639
and various privacy exposures

3130
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:37,440
and tying it in the way spf is tied in

3131
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,119
so that indirect as you said indirect

3132
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:41,280
mail flows don't work there's a lot of

3133
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:42,560
issues with that

3134
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:44,320
that's why we punted on it in the first

3135
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:45,840
place and we said the best thing you can

3136
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,040
do is reduce the window by expiring the

3137
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:50,480
um

3138
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,119
the signature more quickly

3139
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:55,040
but that's the best we could do so good

3140
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:56,960
luck coming up with something but it is

3141
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:59,679
an important issue and uh we could not

3142
01:58:59,679 --> 01:59:02,400
figure out a way to deal with it

3143
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,639
the other thing that al that that's

3144
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:07,520
pushing a lot of these issues is the

3145
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,800
dmarc

3146
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:12,159
is basically the same thing as adsp

3147
01:59:12,159 --> 01:59:14,080
with reporting

3148
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:17,599
and adsp was produced by the dmarc

3149
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:19,920
working group and then failed miserably

3150
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,080
for exactly the reason that dmarc is

3151
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:23,760
causing problems

3152
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:24,800
that

3153
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:26,960
organizations were using it in ways it

3154
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,560
wasn't intended to be used they were

3155
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:32,639
using it for messages that or for sub

3156
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:35,119
domains that were intended to be used

3157
01:59:35,119 --> 01:59:37,040
post to mailing lists

3158
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:39,679
and then it broke mailing list stuff the

3159
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:41,840
way dmarc is

3160
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:44,320
um that's also a very difficult problem

3161
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:46,080
to solve because uh

3162
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:48,400
dmarc was not originally intended to be

3163
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:51,040
used for those kinds of domains and

3164
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,199
certain domains found that it solved a

3165
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:56,800
problem they had and used it

3166
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,360
so trying to go back pedal and figure

3167
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:02,080
out how to make that work as we've done

3168
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:06,320
with uh with arc is as an attempt

3169
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,960
and just some background and things to

3170
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,599
think about as we try to move forward

3171
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:14,320
thanks barry yeah i think the the bcc is

3172
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,599
probably the easiest one of these to

3173
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:16,960
solve because this would be a header

3174
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,040
that's added by the dkim signer as it

3175
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:21,199
signs it to each copy as it goes out so

3176
02:00:21,199 --> 02:00:22,800
it's not stored

3177
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,800
more than the receipt to in over the

3178
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:27,119
wire is stored no but the problem is

3179
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:29,199
that when when the user then

3180
02:00:29,199 --> 02:00:31,760
replies to or forwards that message then

3181
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,760
you start exposing some of the headers

3182
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:36,159
that are in the message that were not

3183
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:37,040

3184
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:39,520
when for bcc normally both systems add

3185
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:42,239

3186
