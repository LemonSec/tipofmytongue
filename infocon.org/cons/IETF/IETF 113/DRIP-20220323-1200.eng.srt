1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,960
well these are all the slides the stuff

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,480
that's on the data tracker and that's

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,000
the ones that we've uploaded for meat

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,519
echo

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,480

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,439
bob's thing is on a github repository

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
it's not in the data tracker right so we

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
can't pick it up yet

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,439
and i think bob was intending not to use

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,880
any slice because you only got a couple

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,960

i

110
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,320

112
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,360

113
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,519
question i would say um

114
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,360
you can jump into

115
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,120
into the conversation

116
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,160
um

117
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,880

118
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,160

um

124
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,959

um our first rfc being published

126
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,279

137
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
chord document which is the

138
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
err id

139
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,760
that is in working group last school

140
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839

142
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,680
um

143
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,040
where

144
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,279
we have a few other documents that we

145
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,640
need to

146
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,440
to focus on um it's not the end of the

147
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,320
road but we're pretty good in that

148
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,720
um i see the registries

149
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120

150
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
the year

151
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,760
for the next itf we think uh oauth

152
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,720
oath might be

153
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,320
a good target

154
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,160
um pretty confident about that one

155
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,839
um the error id was for december

156
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,440
2021 but

157
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,200
i mean we're only in march so

158
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,959

168
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,560

for the i would say for the editors to

177
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,600
report any last minute major issues you

178
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
have on the um

179
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,360
and for the read there's only one flight

180
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,440
from from school so if there's nothing

181
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
to report from the uh from the ark we

182
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,079
can move to the next one so for bob to

183
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,240
report in here i would say last major

184
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
issue on his side

185
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
thanks i don't see

186
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,519
any slides for bob in the decks to share

187
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
um

188
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,079
and that's that's what that's what i was

189
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,839
saying is that for the first two ones

190
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,200
for the architecture and the red there

191
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,160
is no slides okay just only for first

192
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,399
two it's the last i would say

193
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,760
item so

194
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,399
there is no major issue for the arc a

195
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,760
segment that

196
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,959
can jump in and commend the red draft

197
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,040
and then we can move to uh to see what

198
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,079
for the

199
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,240
for the astm uh update

200
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
got it okay

201
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,839
thank you

202
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,959
so i think

203
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,040
yeah did you want me to proceed with

204
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,320
this one

205
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,839
i believe so

206
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,560
okay

207
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,440
so

208
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,360
uh we all know our first rfc has been

209
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,320
published

210
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,839
and then um

211
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,800
at right about the same time as our uh

212
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,160
requirements and terminology were

213
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,199
published

214
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,839
the astm f-38 committee which is the

215
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,760
unmanned aircraft system

216
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,600
operations committee

217
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,199
entered ballot on two uas red documents

218
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,920
one of them is the revision of f 3411-19

219
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,680
which has been the basis of most of our

220
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,560
work

221
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,440
there

222
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,120
was extensive

223
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,000
uh

224
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,800
okay it went away um there was extensive

225
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,240
work um

226
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,440
done on um f-3411

227
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
in order to

228
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,519
keep up with the regulatory changes in

229
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,120
both the u.s and in europe uh we didn't

230
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,399
have a lot of

231
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
inputs from the rest of the world um

232
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,959
the ballot has since closed

233
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,720
a few days ago and there was only one

234
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,680
negative ballot the way astm works that

235
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,079
one negative ballot must be resolved in

236
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,480
other words either the chair needs to

237
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,320
convince the one who filed that ballot

238
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,920
to

239
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,600
rescind it

240
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,399
or

241
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,279
the

242
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,000
working group needs to find the ballot

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,680
non-persuasive

244
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,920
and then a higher level within the astm

245
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,199
needs to agree with that decision that

246
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,360
it was non-persuasive this may take a

247
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
while because it's an allegation of

248
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,639
international of intellectual property

249
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,399
conflict of interest fortunately the

250
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,160
means of compliance which is a document

251
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,600
saying how to

252
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
satisfy an faa regulation

253
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
based upon the technical standard passed

254
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,040
unanimously um the picture in the middle

255
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,360
is just an illustration of the

256
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,279
um flow if you will of requirements uh

257
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,959
from external

258
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,720
down to our

259
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,120
proposed standard drafts

260
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,519
as you know the architecture draft is

261
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,000
just entered iatf last call this mormon

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
morning

263
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,480
there are some nits there now we wonder

264
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,639
and this is not a question for ietf but

265
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,000
i just want you all to be aware of the

266
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,839
question whether we're also going to

267
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,199
need to come up with a means of

268
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,199
compliance draft to show how our

269
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,320
drip rfc is once published can be used

270
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
to address the

271
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,040
things that the astm f-3411 standard

272
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,519
does not address which is primarily how

273
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,399
to dynamically assign session ids ensure

274
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,480
that they are trackable by authorized

275
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,800
parties only back to

276
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,519
the operator and the

277
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,839
serial number of the aircraft

278
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,000
and we had a successful field test last

279
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,839
summer which we're going to do another

280
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,920
one this summer and we're hoping at that

281
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,519
point to check the interoperability of

282
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,839
our prototypes with those of others and

283
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,360
that is all i have thank you

284
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,120
any comments or questions

285
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,920
okay then thanks thank you

286
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,399
any questions

287
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,040
any questions

288
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,519
any questions or comments

289
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,639
nobody

290
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,079
okay then thanks we'll move on to the

291
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,119
next item on the agenda

292
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,319
which is implementation

293
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,559
hello everybody can you hear me well

294
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,039
hi andre

295
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,439
perfect okay so this is an update that

296
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,760
we were developing in in shopping

297
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
university with students regarding the

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,240
implementation of drip

299
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,799
protocols next slide

300
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,440
so this is our reference architecture so

301
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,160
there is like five components

302
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,600
observer with android application up uh

303
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,120
the drone with

304
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,640
raspberry pi and other add-ons like gps

305
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,960
and battery and

306
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,039
when the registry based on eroja

307
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,240
blockchain which keeps track of um

308
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,559
drone data and then there are different

309
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,840
types of users that can request this uh

310
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,720
data from from blockchain so next i will

311
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,559
describe like the progress of different

312
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,000
components

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,240
so code is using open heap

314
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,720
implementation of host identity protocol

315
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,120
with different additions

316
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,559
and it's a

317
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,520
part which is open source so

318
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
some changes which are coming

319
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,880
because of change both with in

320
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,799
hierarchical hits format we'll need to

321
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,320
address that

322
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,720
and second part is that mostly python

323
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,360
trips to handle this

324
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
registration and

325
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,679
look up messages so it's not currently

326
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,919
published but we work to do it

327
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,760
towards end of year

328
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,320
next slide

329
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,440
so the

330
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,720
the drone broadcasts things using stm

331
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,880
format with drip additions based on

332
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
extension of drone id and

333
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,160
we experiment with wi-fi uh different

334
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
modes as well as bluetooth 4 and

335
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,400
bluetooth 5. we also have like

336
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,799
registry implementation using eroja as i

337
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,240
mentioned

338
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,799
as well as extension of android app to

339
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,679
to do the lookups based for web server

340
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,559
next one

341
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,919
so why

342
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,000
irocan it's a

343
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,240
blockchain that it's permission-based

344
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,559
and it has some nice features so we

345
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,679
actually

346
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,160
did also some simulations to

347
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
understand what kind of uh

348
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,799
number of drones it can handle and it's

349
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,960
quite promising so it's like let's say

350
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,120
hundred of drones within uh certain

351
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,919
limited geographical areas is supported

352
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,039
in terms of

353
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,520
transaction times and

354
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,080
processing times and hence

355
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,799
and

356
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,559
next it's also

357
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,120
next slide please it's also supporting

358
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,200
uh some of

359
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
all the requirements that specified in

360
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,400
with drip registry draft

361
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,120
so i hope it will be also included as

362
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,840
one option in the future of um revision

363
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,640
of

364
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,760
registries uh rafat adam is

365
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,960
promoting

366
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
next

367
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,679
so i'm now going to talk briefly about

368
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,679
our experiments with bluetooth five

369
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,280
quite many devices claim now they

370
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
support bluetooth five but it seems like

371
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,880
not all features are actually supported

372
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,240
so for example raspberry pi 4 is not

373
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
really supporting it

374
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,360
well enough so we are trying to

375
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
experience with

376
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,720
a dongle and development kit rf52

377
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,159
f40 to sort of test the range and other

378
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,440
features

379
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
next slide

380
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,960
i have a question

381
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,840
yes

382
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
um when you say it does not support um

383
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,280
what is not support exactly um

384
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,400
well as you know there are different

385
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
profiles for example long range

386
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,360
bluetooth 5 or low low battery bluetooth

387
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,600
5 so it means like it maybe supports

388
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,400
some limited version of this

389
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,360
okay

390
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,559
okay

391
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,600
um if you don't mind andre i'll expand

392
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,760
on that a little bit basically

393
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,080
a lot of hardware chips will support

394
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,320
bluetooth 5 the spec

395
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,120
is an extension of bluetooth 4 but all

396
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,200
of the extensions for bluetooth 5 are

397
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,440
optional the only one being back port to

398
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,600
bluetooth 4. so you could have a chip

399
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,919
that supports all the new features of

400
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,840
bluetooth 5 but then the firmware

401
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,159
running the chip doesn't and then the

402
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,000
software above that at the os level

403
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,679
doesn't and then the software above that

404
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,320
doesn't so you get this layering problem

405
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
of the chip will support all the stuff

406
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,640
but the stuff above it won't

407
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,520
and so you have to find the right match

408
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,000
to do it so for example the only phone

409
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,840
i've found that supports everything we

410
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,520
need for bluetooth 5 is samsung galaxy

411
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,440
s10 or s20 smartphones

412
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
right so we were trying to address this

413
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,400
for example by plugging this dongle into

414
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,919
into raspberry pi

415
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,240
4 and but as you said there are some

416
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
complications on firmware and driver

417
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,280
level so

418
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,919
we only had limited success with that so

419
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,360
far

420
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,918
next slide

421
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,600
but

422
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,799
yeah we have a script which using

423
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,559
python extensions and when it's

424
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,159
depending on which

425
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,919
communication interface is active and

426
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,159
available it will try to

427
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,720
send wifi bacon mode upload to five or

428
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
four and so on

429
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,200
next slide

430
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,520
so for wi-fi um

431
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,919
it works but it's a short range maybe

432
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,280
some

433
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,200
less than 100 meters so we're also

434
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,520
looking at the neighborhood awareness

435
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
mode which is getting support in the

436
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
recent phones

437
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,960
however

438
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,440
people like bob pointed out that now

439
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,240
wi-fi beacons is a way to go but i'm not

440
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,480
sure what's the level of support

441
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,240
of that and the recent hardware we have

442
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,640
to investigate

443
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,200
next slide and this is the observer

444
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,000
application it's based on uh

445
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,720
open drone id extension as in as you can

446
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,280
see it successfully receives

447
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,080
h

448
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
hits from the drones and displays

449
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,960
location as well allows to query

450
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
the database where registry based on

451
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,159
user credentials

452
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
next slide

453
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,679
and regarding the bluetooth 5 we did

454
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,840
some measurements it's not so easy to

455
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,120
find like

456
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,760
one kilometer open space in sweden so we

457
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
actually had to go to the two lake

458
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,880
and uh with this development kit we were

459
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,720
able to reach about one nordic mile

460
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,559
distance which is already much better

461
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,280
than

462
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,559
let's say 100 meters with wi-fi so once

463
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,720
we uh kind of

464
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,960
resolve this compatibility issue we will

465
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,720
new to five in different devices

466
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,840
hopefully it will be good means

467
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,320
next slide

468
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,640
so as you see these are components we

469
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,799
have to combine and put it like add-on

470
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,520
to to let's say a phantom drone so there

471
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,760
is a raspberry pi uh for when there is

472
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,120
battery hat and then where is gps so

473
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,520
all of that should be like mounted on a

474
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,480
drone to actually transmit this

475
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
id data

476
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,279
um

477
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,640
well now actually there is model b of uh

478
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,480
raspberry pi 4 so i hope it will have

479
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,520
better

480
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,080
uh bluetooth 5 support so maybe you can

481
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,640
do without a dongle extension

482
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,600
so

483
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,240
simplifies things

484
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,799
next slide

485
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,840
and regarding

486
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,880
openhip it's currently hosted on bit

487
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,559
bucket so you can download the code here

488
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,640
next

489
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,120
so one of the things we were trying to

490
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,080
do is to add the support for open ssl 30

491
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,600
because it's like

492
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,080
latest crypto library which has all the

493
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,840
latest

494
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,400
ciphers and hashes and so on

495
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,799
and the

496
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,520
open hip is

497
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,840
it's historically based on open sl one

498
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,600
zero and then it was extended a little

499
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,240
bit to one one zero but still

500
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
like not the latest one

501
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,399
next

502
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,919
so it was kind of challenging because

503
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,799
open

504
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,640
heap uses a lot of

505
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,960
sort of deprecated calls which are now

506
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,080
not supported in ssl three zero anymore

507
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,760
and when when you start changing one

508
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,360
part it sort of

509
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
leads to dependencies in the other parts

510
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,320
so it was like basically almost rewrite

511
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,840
of the code because it was like

512
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,039
thousands of warnings and other stuff

513
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,799
next slide

514
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,200
but we kind of finished the

515
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,520
update so the code is compiled

516
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,279
but it's not

517
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,600
well tested yet so we are maybe in

518
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,559
autumn we will work on more um

519
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,200
automatic tests to sort of uh

520
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
and packet format tests to make sure

521
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
it's

522
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,679
like interoperable and compatible to the

523
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,919
latest air fesis

524
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,440
next

525
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,520
also we were working about

526
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,000
not traversal implementation so you see

527
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
this rfc 9028 is relatively fresh from

528
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,840
from

529
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,480
july uh so again we finished basic

530
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
implementation but more testing is

531
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,600
needed

532
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,799
um but i'm curious to see your opinion

533
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,559
uh like is it really

534
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,520
helpful for for drip do we need uh to go

535
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,400
like over utp or and use ice or we

536
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
assume that we can have like always

537
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,760
direct

538
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,240
hip and ipsec you know in all cases

539
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,919
maybe at least for the

540
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:34,880
kind of

541
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,799
remote registry access maybe it's useful

542
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,520
next so we still

543
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,600
there is something to do so there is

544
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,679
like data relay server implementation to

545
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,880
do

546
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,080
and

547
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,159
update the core simulator that we used

548
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,880
for these use cases

549
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,600
next please

550
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,520
so what we are also doing is we are

551
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,480
trying to do formal verification um

552
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,640
like i know for example bob likes this

553
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,960
idea that the security protocol should

554
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
be formally verified and the

555
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,360
last attempt to do it for hip i think it

556
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,960
was uh

557
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,000
like

558
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,799
10-15 years ago so we are now using more

559
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,039
modern tool and also implement drip

560
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,880
features

561
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,600
and also we are involved in several eu

562
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,760
projects which are

563
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,480
targeting to do big scale demonstrations

564
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,760
like

565
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,600
almost a drone flying taxi or ambulance

566
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
so for example there are some

567
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,760
testbeds planned in

568
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,840
norway scavander and in helsinki

569
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,000
so try to put some

570
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,640
prototype and hardware to these drones

571
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,279
to broadcast remote id

572
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,200
and xoro squam is another example that

573
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,919
is also like large-scale demonstration

574
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,320
so we plan to fly a big drone between

575
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,080
two cities in sweden beyond light of

576
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,039
sight so maybe one of first operations

577
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,880
like that and it also would be nice to

578
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,360
to have a drip as part of this thing

579
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,159
and

580
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,960
the final slide please yeah so

581
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,000
this air more is focusing on emergency

582
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,440
medical services

583
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,279
because based on surveys it seems like

584
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,880
it's a kind of

585
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,799
application area that most people will

586
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,760
support adoption of drones even if it's

587
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,039
noise and some other features and

588
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,520
you see there are some chinese models

589
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,720
like

590
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,200
which is already purchased and

591
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
being tested and in norway and

592
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,760
they of course

593
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
waiting for some authorities permissions

594
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,679
to actually start

595
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,000
flying people in that so it's

596
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,440
ongoing

597
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,399
research and active area in new space in

598
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,840
europe

599
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,240
so that's it on my side if there are any

600
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,640
comments

601
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,679
questions you andre if anyone's got any

602
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,279
questions or comments could you please

603
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,600
put their hand up in the techo chat

604
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,000
and then identify themselves when they

605
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,080
speak also someone's speaking at all

606
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,840
please see who they are for the benefit

607
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,600
of everybody in the room

608
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
stuart is taking notes and i'm sure he

609
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,520
recognizes everybody's voice but there

610
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,039
may be other people taking part in the

611
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,799
meeting sorry

612
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,000
stuart

613
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,840
is um

614
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,279
taking notes of this meeting and it

615
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,600
probably recognizes everybody's voice

616
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,520
but other people are in the room here or

617
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,840
on the internet somewhere else might not

618
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,679
recognize who's speaking something by

619
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,600
yourself when you come to the mic thank

620
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,200
you very much

621
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,960
and help first question from daniel

622
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,559
yeah so

623
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,840
i have uh

624
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,880
one question to andrew uh it's a

625
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,159
um

626
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,520
i mean i i don't see the the migration

627
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,640
to open ssr three as a huge

628
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,840
challenge

629
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,240
but i just want to check if i am correct

630
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,840
well in terms of

631
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,080
i mean

632
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,279
yeah i mean it's uh if you have like

633
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,200
legacy code it's like a lot of update

634
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,159
it's uh

635
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,080
almost like rewriting from scratch so

636
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,840
i'm not

637
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,919
sure about other people using hip are

638
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,960
very going to do the operator

639
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,120
okay because that's okay that's not the

640
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,479
rip that's the on the hip

641
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,120
side of it

642
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,440
yes but you need heat right for for

643
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,159
registering yeah yeah sure yeah i forgot

644
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,720
this

645
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,080
okay thanks bob

646
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,240
pointing out as i said in the in the

647
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,360
chat

648
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,240
that

649
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,799
um the value one of the big values of

650
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,679
hip

651
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,600
for the ua

652
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,480
is going to be for network remote id and

653
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,960
command and control um and not being

654
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,360
locked into a single

655
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,760
connection methodology

656
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,320
he has demonstrated this already

657
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,559
in his test over at the

658
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,600
uas site there in fact in his

659
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,960
neighborhood here in griffith

660
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,519
international air force booth

661
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,720
you can do that in previous sessions

662
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
so uh uh you may think that this is

663
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,159
orthogonal the the open hip discussion

664
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,720
um but it is going to be important as we

665
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,039
move forward to the next steps than

666
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,240
being able just to well support the

667
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,600
activities

668
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,320
for um

669
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,000
where we go beyond

670
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,480
the basic broadcast messages when we

671
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,039
start moving on to the network remote id

672
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,200
and and support for better support for

673
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,840
command and control

674
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,720
that's it

675
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,519
to clarify

676
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,559
while

677
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,360
command and control itself

678
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
uh does not lie strictly within the

679
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,760
scope of the drip working group

680
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,279
recreating

681
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,880
applications

682
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,480
based upon identity does and so that

683
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,640
would include so-called detect and avoid

684
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,320
command and control

685
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,240
vehicle to infrastructure vehicle to

686
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,279
vehicle etc

687
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,080
daniel

688
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,200
andreas presented one implementation

689
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,559
um i guess two in adam as another

690
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,919
implementation

691
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,120
um

692
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,559
did you do some uh interrupt

693
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:47,120
interoperability test or um

694
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,120
um are we aware of

695
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,240
any other

696
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,960
implementation at that point and uh

697
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,240
um

698
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,960
maybe if if that's possible um adam was

699
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,799
too um

700
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,960
can you just uh let us know

701
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,000
um

702
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,559
uh what you are implementing i mean uh

703
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,480
are you doing the equivalent of uh

704
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,039
androids or is that um

705
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,279
more restrained or more specific

706
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,960
i mean if it's possible i'd like to have

707
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,960
some more detail i would be interested

708
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,600
okay

709
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,000
so this is a free time check here

710
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,399
we are about 10 minutes late right now

711
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,960
so keep it brief please

712
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,240
adam do you want to take this or you

713
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,720
want me to

714
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,679
please go ahead

715
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,399
okay so i'll make it very quick um adam

716
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,919
and others

717
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,399
at the new york uas test site are doing

718
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,000
a tremendous amount of work in

719
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,880
prototyping unfortunately the nature of

720
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,720
our funding is such

721
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,760
that it is a struggle to get any of it

722
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,080
openly released we will continue the

723
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,480
struggle

724
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,120
next up all right

725
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,760
yep thanks i hope everyone can hear me

726
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,240
uh so i'm gonna go over two topics today

727
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,760
i'm gonna go over

728
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,600
authentication formats

729
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,280
and also the registries so i'll start

730
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,800
with authentication formats because

731
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,918
that'll be pretty pretty quick on us

732
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,440
um so changing since 03 the fec section

733
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,520
is now fully filled in it will need

734
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,599
somewhat of an extensive review

735
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,440
uh there were a couple small things that

736
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,040
were changed on uh two of the formats

737
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,679
appendix a was fully filled in with some

738
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,159
diagrams and some text an appendix d was

739
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,280
added

740
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,359
for to do med's comment

741
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,800
um so sir some still some pending issues

742
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,040
as i said fec needs to get reviewed um

743
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,119
i've noticed that with reed solomon

744
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,079
especially in my implementation that you

745
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,320
need a specific polynomial on both sides

746
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,079
for the forward error correction to even

747
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,520
properly work

748
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,839
and i have run into an issue where i've

749
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,480
had colliding polynomials so we might

750
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,640
have to actually specify one in the

751
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,040
draft i'm not sure how to approach this

752
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,599
so i'd like some guidance on that

753
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,079
or we can just work on it as a working

754
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,280
group together

755
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,240
the appendix d was to directly address a

756
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,680
comment from med

757
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,160
hopefully it satisfies his comment along

758
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,720
with a conjunction with appendix a

759
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,400
and then i need to loosen some language

760
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,119
there's some weird language during some

761
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,119
transition where manifest became the

762
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,160
required and thing but it used to be

763
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,440
wrapper

764
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,400
but it seems like both can be used so i

765
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,160
have to just fix some of the wording

766
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,640
around in that to get it

767
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,079
right

768
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,079
uh for next steps on this draft i'm

769
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,480
going to be sending it internally in ax

770
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,640
enterprise to laura welch for an english

771
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,800
language review she's

772
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,480
very good at english

773
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,760
and maybe not so much on the technical

774
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,280
side but she'll be able to read through

775
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,720
the draft

776
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,880
make it readable

777
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,320
to humans that are not technically as

778
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,280
savvy

779
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,760
and help find any major issues um i

780
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
actually just got the sector review uh

781
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,240
right before this meeting so i'm gonna

782
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,720
be responding to rich

783
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,800
after this he's given some great

784
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,760
comments

785
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,839
and i believe we're ready for working

786
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,240
group last call although the chairs can

787
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
put their own opinion out on it so

788
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,160
anything discussion wise on auth from

789
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,480
anybody otherwise i'll continue straight

790
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,880
into registries

791
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,960
i'm going to take that as nothing so

792
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,000
i'll go right into registries so

793
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,920
this is the registries draft we're on

794
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,599
version one now

795
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,280
from zero zero

796
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,920
so changes from zero zero uh this was a

797
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,960
massive rewrite on my part the first

798
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,920
push was an absolute mess i

799
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,640
hated the document as it was so i took

800
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,920
some time

801
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,599
about a week and a half and really

802
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,480
cleaned it up reorganized it there's

803
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,400
some new sections in the introduction to

804
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,040
get a high level of view of like a story

805
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,880
of a typical life cycle using the

806
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,480
registries in drip

807
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,079
uh there was a whole section of

808
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,839
attestations and certificates that was

809
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,760
moved down into the appendix because

810
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,240
inline it was getting really clunky to

811
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,640
read the document

812
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,720
there was some text added for key

813
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
rollover and federation of registries

814
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,359
which i'll touch on a little bit later

815
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,359
and there was an attempt at merging high

816
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,240
level points from the deep section 5

817
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,640
into the section 4 of this document i'm

818
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,560
going to be working more with bob to

819
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,400
make sure that i got all the pieces

820
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,040
needed for that and

821
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,640
massage any text

822
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,520
there

823
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,320
um the big change from this was sections

824
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,359
seven and sections eight of zero zero

825
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,400
were merged into one section section six

826
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,079
so that would got a lot cleaner in

827
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,480
formatting it was more fleshed out

828
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,280
section seven uh in the original

829
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,000
document was extremely technical

830
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,760
and just

831
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,800
very hard to read where section eight

832
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,480
was more of

833
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,800
prose and like a story and how

834
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,720
registration works with the inner

835
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,760
components

836
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,000
they've been melded together in a lot

837
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,800
hopefully an easier way to understand

838
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,480
also epp and rdep sections were added

839
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,599
and

840
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,520
any examples that were shown in the epp

841
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,119
section have been come

842
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,079
have

843
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,920
came out of the ax implementation

844
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,440
so the title of the document is

845
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
currently going to change when we go to

846
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,359
o2

847
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,400
and the title will be drip entity tags

848
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,800
registration and lookup and this is

849
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,880
mainly the primary focus of the draft

850
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,480
it's look up in the registration of

851
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,119
deets and other information associated

852
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,280
around the deed

853
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,680
drip is not bound to dns epp or rdap um

854
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,119
i think there might have been a little

855
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,640
bit of a misconception that this was

856
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,520
going to be the only way for it to work

857
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,320
no that wasn't the intention it is

858
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,760
we're going to use dns epp and rdap as a

859
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,640
baseline to get something out the door

860
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,920
standardized and working for deploying

861
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,480
and then also drip is not exactly bound

862
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,800
to the d it's just come up in previous

863
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,760
meetings

864
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,520
there was no there has been no other

865
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
solution being put forward but if one

866
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,839
does come later in the registries

867
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:34,640
um

868
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,400
the registration architecture that we

869
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,359
currently have is strongly tied to the

870
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,480
drip entity tags hid structure the raa

871
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,359
hda split so if someone wants to write

872
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,920
another registry draft either one they

873
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,320
need to mimic the hid in their

874
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,280
identifier or two produce a whole new

875
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,599
registration architecture

876
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,000
using their new um

877
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,880
identifier format and hierarchy

878
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,000
um

879
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,319
and that's a bridge we will go across if

880
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,880
we need to but i tried to make it so

881
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,200
that the document was clear that this

882
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,359
ties with the deet

883
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,920
and if something else comes along

884
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,119
it would be a different draft

885
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:17,920
so

886
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,119
pending issues um there was a error on

887
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,920
my part when i pushed

888
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,560
i was asked to do a contributor section

889
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,119
i accidentally copied and pasted the

890
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:29,920
full

891
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,280
acknowledgement section into the

892
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,240
contributors section so scott allenbeck

893
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,200
was pulled into the contributors section

894
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,760
and i didn't realize i had done this so

895
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,920
he has been pulled back out in a uh

896
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,560
running version that's on my side and

897
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,960
he's back as an acknowledgement uh andre

898
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,440
was pulled as a contributor uh speaking

899
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,079
of andre uh i actually

900
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,280
oversighted and lost his text email

901
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,560
um

902
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,119
a couple months ago i found it again so

903
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,359
i have the text again um and i will be

904
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,800
adding it in

905
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,680
uh per andre's uh

906
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,079
presentation a little bit earlier um i

907
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,240
don't know if this is an appendix or if

908
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,000
it's going in line i believe it's an

909
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,040
appendix and that's where i'm going to

910
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,480
put it for now

911
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,800
and then we'll go from there

912
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,640
scott hollenbeck on the mailing list

913
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,359
gave a really great suggestion in

914
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,680
breaking the epp and rdap sections out

915
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,520
into separate documents

916
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,680
i like the suggestion

917
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,119
but i

918
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,040
want to feel the working group out to

919
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,200
see if we want to do such a thing and

920
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,800
add more documents to the listing

921
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,720
um i need to work with bob and i've

922
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,160
already discussed it with him about

923
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,319
pulling text for the ra and hda into

924
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,960
this draft so

925
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,720
hopefully that will happen in the next

926
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,880
couple of weeks and then i'll push o2

927
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,119
out

928
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,839
um so the rest of this time well

929
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,119
actually

930
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,520
bob let's take your question because i

931
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,520
have plenty of time

932
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,200
just uh quickly uh the top moving text

933
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,440
up from rid to registries um just

934
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,880
text from red to auth um we start with

935
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,960
the text and read to get it kind of laid

936
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,240
out and once the uh um where it belongs

937
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,440
started um evolving um we moved the text

938
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,640
so uh um dad and i will

939
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,440
do it

940
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,599
we'll be pulling checks out of red and

941
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,160
moving it where it belongs in registries

942
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,040
um

943
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,800
so everything i think will be cool for

944
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,640
everybody and then then i'll show up in

945
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,520
the my next strap the red 18 draft and

946
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
uh and and adam's next draft on

947
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,520
registries

948
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,960
thanks bob

949
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,079
okay so i want to spend the rest of the

950
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,240
15 minutes of this to go over some

951
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,000
registration process stuff

952
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
um this is the first time i think this

953
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,680
has been presented to the working group

954
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,040
this has been internal uh to

955
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,680
well basically myself and stu for the

956
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,359
past year um and i'm finally getting the

957
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,200
chance to kind of go a little bit more

958
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,760
in detail to it

959
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,560
just as a recap this is our registry

960
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,880
tree diagram this is how the registries

961
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,599
are laid out in hierarchy we have a

962
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,079
single root registry which takes the

963
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,359
values of 0 and 0 for the rea and the

964
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,000
hda and then there's two branches of the

965
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,520
tree there's a branch on the left that

966
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,319
consists of the irm and the mra

967
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,440
which

968
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
is mostly dealing with serial numbers

969
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,200
and then the branch on the right which

970
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,160
deals with other raas mostly under civil

971
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,920
aviation authorities

972
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,200
and they have uh values of

973
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,680
ras greater than two and hda is greater

974
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,200
than one

975
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,119
and then of course an unmanned aircraft

976
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,040
would register with two different

977
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,960
registries in the system one for its

978
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,520
serial number and one for its session id

979
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,040
and then with broadcast rate going to

980
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,280
the observer and then dns and rdap

981
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,480
lookups happening over the internet

982
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,119
we have three major typical registration

983
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,960
operations the serial number

984
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,440
registration of the manufacturer

985
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,480
into the mra and that's usually a d

986
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,480
encoded as an ansi cta 2063-8

987
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,200
serial number and this is documented in

988
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,440
the deep draft that bob has

989
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,920
there's an operator registration at

990
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,160
what is nominally would be considered a

991
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,200
uss but it's actually specifically the

992
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,200
remote id registry

993
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,839
uh portion of drip

994
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,480
and this key indeed would be used by the

995
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,880
operator during session id registration

996
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,680
and then finally session id registration

997
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,560
also at that uss or that remote id

998
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,520
registry and that is a deet proposed to

999
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,119
be used by the ua

1000
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,200
during flight for that given flight

1001
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,040
so this is a

1002
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,839
z diagram it's not perfect there are

1003
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,319
some issues with this that i'd like to

1004
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,440
fix but to get us started um so this is

1005
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,800
serial number registration into the mre

1006
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,480
or the manufacturer's registry of

1007
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,760
aircraft

1008
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
basically at the start of time the

1009
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,359
manufacturer would build an unmanned

1010
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,800
aircraft

1011
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,520
they most likely will generate the key

1012
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,520
pair and the drip entity tag associated

1013
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,839
with that unmanned aircraft

1014
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,160
if the unmanned aircraft can't create

1015
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,319
the key pair itself

1016
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,119
uh and they would propose it to the

1017
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,599
manufacturer's registry

1018
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,319
using a self-attack station

1019
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,880
there's some internal stuff that goes on

1020
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,000
extracting the drip entity tag checking

1021
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,079
for collisions in both the database and

1022
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,359
the dns

1023
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,560
um so to make a comment that i've gotten

1024
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,680
from stu recently on these slides

1025
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,599
there's a reason that dns and database

1026
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,800
are different or split apart on this the

1027
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,440
database mostly holds a personally

1028
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,319
identifiable information or pii

1029
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,040
or just other additional information

1030
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,599
in this particular scenario

1031
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,560
um we would be holding ua information

1032
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,359
the ua's weight how many rotors it has

1033
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,880
what color is it

1034
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,760
um make and model obviously

1035
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,280
what type of battery

1036
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,480
chemistry it has

1037
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,240
and this is so that people can easily

1038
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,160
look that stuff up and not have to

1039
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,279
scrape web pages

1040
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,599
once everything is completed though

1041
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,920
during a registration resource records

1042
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,280
are added into

1043
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,880
dns

1044
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,160
private information is added to the

1045
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,280
database

1046
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,040
the serial number the public key the

1047
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,839
the

1048
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,240
drip entity tag and any attestations

1049
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,839
that are produced are pushed into the

1050
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,440
unmanned aircraft

1051
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,880
in a secure element hopefully

1052
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,880
so this is two examples these are pulled

1053
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,720
from the

1054
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,440
drip registry draft as it is stands

1055
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,440
right now uh on the left is an epp

1056
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,640
uh command

1057
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,920
uh for

1058
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,559
registering a serial number and as you

1059
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,000
can see all of the fields here are you

1060
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,480
know make model color material those

1061
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,800
kinds of things that would end up in

1062
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,680
the database and then on the right

1063
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,079
is our inputs and our outputs

1064
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,640
and also our dns entries what fields of

1065
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,760
dns exist or what resource records in

1066
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,079
dns exist for a given serial number

1067
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,480
now while the serial number is useful

1068
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,680
and we can

1069
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,240
create a serial number using a deet and

1070
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,440
that helps for modules the real

1071
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,839
important one for drip is the session id

1072
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,079
which is what the deed is acting as it's

1073
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,680
acting as a uas

1074
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,359
uh session id

1075
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,760
so a very similar process happens with a

1076
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,160
session id um hopefully the aircraft can

1077
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,240
create their own key pair

1078
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,040
um in this scenario so basically the

1079
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,960
operator would poke the aircraft it

1080
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,160
would generate its key pair

1081
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,640
send it along with a serial number and

1082
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,040
additional information around

1083
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,880
back to the operator who x is basically

1084
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,640
a middleman between the aircraft and the

1085
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,400
registry software

1086
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,559
passing it back and forth

1087
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,760
we have the same

1088
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,160
kinds of checks for collision checking

1089
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,599
with the deets and all the varying parts

1090
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,680
and once it's done

1091
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,319
importantly for this the broadcast

1092
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,359
attestation is generated and this is

1093
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,319
vital as in drip we require that the

1094
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,480
broadcast attestation be sent over the

1095
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,040
air uh in the authentication message

1096
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,400
this is what the auth draft is all about

1097
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,079
and this is where that broadcast

1098
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,640
attestation comes from

1099
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,240
and this is all handed back to the

1100
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,800
unmanned aircraft through the operator

1101
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,680
there are other ways to cut this cake um

1102
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,359
you know we could have the unmanned

1103
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,359
aircraft reach through an lte connection

1104
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,440
right to the remote id registry that is

1105
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,000
a valid way of doing it this is just one

1106
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,720
of

1107
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,200
a different many different ways to

1108
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,319
do this process

1109
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,760
again this is some examples so on the

1110
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,280
left

1111
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,760
which is not the same as the last slide

1112
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,000
these are the dns entries that would be

1113
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,720
in

1114
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,280
uh the remote id registry along with

1115
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,520
what inputs and outputs

1116
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,880
were needed

1117
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,200
for the registration to occur

1118
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,920
and then on the right is the epp is an

1119
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,400
example of the epp that is sent

1120
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,119
um there is a couple things in the uh

1121
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,520
epp that we have not discussed in this

1122
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,760
working group and one of the major

1123
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,760
things is the operational intent the

1124
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,559
operational intent is

1125
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,319
basically the utm link back into utm to

1126
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,359
get the 4d volume box

1127
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,800
if

1128
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,880
uh the particip if they are

1129
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,240
participating in utm

1130
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,640
so some next steps on the registry draft

1131
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,200
i want some feedback on the epp examples

1132
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,920
that would be absolutely lovely um i

1133
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,000
need to produce some rdap examples we

1134
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
haven't gotten into that yet

1135
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,559
uh there as i said before there's i

1136
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,480
talked about some federations and key

1137
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,680
rollover

1138
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,240
it's an interesting topic because we're

1139
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,839
going to have to probably federate

1140
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,800
registries and with the h hit or the d

1141
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,160
acting as its identifier and the last 64

1142
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,599
bits being

1143
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,040
the hash

1144
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,200
it'll be interesting to see how this

1145
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,880
works because the hid would be the same

1146
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,960
you could have a registry like the root

1147
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,640
registry 0 0 but you could produce

1148
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,599
2 to the 64 keys and they'll all have

1149
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,680
different hashes but it's all

1150
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,800
technically the same registry so

1151
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,640
i'm curious how this would affect

1152
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,040
deployment and use of the system

1153
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,680
um i don't have any free cycles to

1154
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,359
explore that

1155
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,319
topic even on a crypto security level so

1156
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,720
if there's any takers for that that be

1157
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,800
really interesting and we can add that

1158
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,559
text into the draft

1159
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,760
and i hope to have an interim uh not

1160
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,920
directly after this but maybe a couple

1161
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,640
weeks a month from now

1162
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,680
as to focus on the z diagrams there the

1163
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,480
two z diagrams i showed you are two out

1164
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,359
of

1165
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:40,640
22

1166
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,920
uh z diagrams that i have

1167
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,119
um

1168
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,680
and there i would like to do a deep dive

1169
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,200
with the working group and anyone that's

1170
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,400
interested

1171
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,119
to understand the process and the flow

1172
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,079
that we've had in our heads for the past

1173
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,000
year and a half on how registries would

1174
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,800
work

1175
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,640
to get it into the draft a little bit

1176
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,960
better

1177
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,839
and with that i think i'm ready just to

1178
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,760
take some discussion if anyone has

1179
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,319
anything to discuss for the first time i

1180
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,559
think i am not rushed for time and i

1181
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,400
have eight minutes

1182
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,920
thank you very much adam and that's a

1183
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,079
great job thank

1184
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,040
thank you

1185
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,160
any questions or comments

1186
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,520
going

1187
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,599
going

1188
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:28,559
gone

1189
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,640
if i maybe

1190
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,640
yep um i've only got one um and this at

1191
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,079
the moment this is mostly focused on um

1192
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,480
adam's uh registries draft where there's

1193
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,960
a question of how much detail to include

1194
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,960
on epp and rdap as specific techniques

1195
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,800
for implementing the registries

1196
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,520
and also to some extent on the

1197
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,000
architecture draft i feel like we kind

1198
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
of have a failure to commit here

1199
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,319
to achieve interoperability we need

1200
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,480
specifics and abstraction is a fine

1201
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,800
thing but getting abstractions right

1202
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,400
takes a long time

1203
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,599
and the bus is leaving the station

1204
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,760
with regard to regulations and

1205
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,040
manufacturers building

1206
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,960
application specific integrated circuits

1207
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,400
and so on so we're really going to have

1208
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,079
to come to some decisions rapidly on how

1209
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,040
much specific protocol

1210
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,319
detail to include in these documents

1211
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,400
versus how much to attempt to continue

1212
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,240
to remain abstract and then produce

1213
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,000
still more documents that will have the

1214
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,440
details uh slash ram

1215
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,480
welp

1216
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,839
the concern about the multiple um hits

1217
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:46,760
per

1218
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,240
rari or or hda is being issued that's

1219
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,880
actually how how key rollover will be

1220
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,119
achieved um

1221
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,559
and and how they'll be linked in

1222
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,640
registries so that was part of my

1223
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,559
original thoughts when i came up with

1224
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,359
this idea um it's just that now adam and

1225
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,319
i are gonna have to sit down and get

1226
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:09,280
done over the over the next two months

1227
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,559
um so that that's uh in there it and

1228
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,920
it's as uh students that in an

1229
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,760
implementable way

1230
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,839
so i'll uh

1231
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,960
say this to a little bit to bob but just

1232
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,000
as in general so i knew that key role

1233
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,400
that that was used for key rollover but

1234
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,319
what struck me is interesting was that

1235
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:35,440
we have a root server hda ra0 hda0

1236
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,520
and there's only one of them in the

1237
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,480
registry tree and obviously having that

1238
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,559
sync having it as a single server is a

1239
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,079
point of failure

1240
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,319
so you would probably want to have

1241
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,680
multiple

1242
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,400
root servers kind of like how dns works

1243
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,359
now

1244
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,400
um the problem with that in i think in

1245
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,480
our thing is is like if you want to have

1246
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,960
an asymmetric key pair

1247
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,119
to generate the hit and

1248
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,280
dust the deed etc

1249
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,359
you would need to have a different key

1250
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,040
on every box

1251
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,640
so if you had

1252
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,359
say seven root servers they're all going

1253
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,599
to have different key pairs

1254
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,720
how is this managed right because

1255
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,000
who

1256
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,160
you don't want a

1257
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,720
malicious party joining the club just

1258
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,960
because they created a key pair you

1259
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,720
would want to there needs to be some

1260
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,720
sort of control on that and this happens

1261
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,599
at every level of the registry tree

1262
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,160
and that was where my thought of

1263
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,559
federation and interest in the key role

1264
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,839
over in the keys came in

1265
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,520
but it is a discussion we need to have

1266
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,520
overall

1267
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,200
okay

1268
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,880
no more comments questions

1269
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,119
um bob i think you wanted to have a

1270
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,000
quick word about the status of the rid

1271
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,359
draft but i think that may have been

1272
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,280
overtaken by events judging by the

1273
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,960
comments um

1274
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,040
barely here i got my sound crank cranked

1275
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,920
all the way up but um just again on the

1276
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,079
slides for the rid that i

1277
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,880
have permitted our proposed are out

1278
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,559
there i put url again in the chat

1279
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,440
um it was also on the list

1280
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,640
basically um there's some med has a

1281
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,680
couple things he wants me to address um

1282
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,359
they are

1283
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,480
easy to do work on them next week uh

1284
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,240
ayanna says they are going to do a

1285
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,280
review of the new ayanna considerations

1286
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,839
um i added a lot of text in there so

1287
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,960
they may have a lot of comments um but

1288
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,359
uh ian and i will work that through

1289
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:46,880
uh but uh x i'm parked for the end of

1290
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,400
next week to have dash 18 out

1291
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,119
of any comments on what i haven't had 17

1292
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,720
please get them to me in the beginning

1293
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,440
of the week so i can get them included

1294
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,280
thank you

1295
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,480
okay

1296
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,200
um so i have one more thing to add to

1297
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,520
the meeting this is what i get for not

1298
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,280
putting it on the slide

1299
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,160
um

1300
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,880
so this is to answer daniel a little bit

1301
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,599
earlier when uh andre had finished his

1302
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,880
presentation

1303
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,079
uh my intent

1304
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,480
if all the stars align and the universe

1305
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,760
is nice to me is that in philadelphia at

1306
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,599
ietf 114

1307
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,559
i would like to do a demonstration of

1308
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,400
the ax implementation of uas remote id

1309
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,839
and i want to do a full um a full uh

1310
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,920
demonstration i'll have an aircraft i'll

1311
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,359
have a puck

1312
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,920
i will create well i'll have the

1313
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,440
software loaded on the puck but i will

1314
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,640
perform

1315
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,640
serial number registration and session

1316
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,760
id registration and fly the aircraft and

1317
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,280
pick it up with

1318
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,280
the ax uh

1319
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,520
android application

1320
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,720
so i do intend to have

1321
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,640
a implementation

1322
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,839
share

1323
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,160
also to answer daniel

1324
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,160
from earlier uh

1325
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,359
ax has worked with another uh partner in

1326
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,119
utm that was developing a remote id uh

1327
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,559
application

1328
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,559
uh and it was not drip specific it was

1329
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,440
astm only but our implementation did

1330
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,599
work with theirs so we were able they

1331
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,440
were able to see our identifier we were

1332
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,000
able to see their identifier their

1333
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,319
side just kind of made it garbled

1334
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,559
garbage on their ui but that was because

1335
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,000
they didn't know how to decode it they

1336
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,599
just took the raw bytes and just

1337
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,799
displayed them

1338
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,119
and they were seeing all the pieces

1339
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,200
um they just didn't know what to do with

1340
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,400
all the pieces

1341
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,680
uh as for for with andre uh i would like

1342
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,119
to do an

1343
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,440
interrupt test with him uh we'll

1344
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,359
coordinate that somehow it's kind of

1345
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,000
hard to do an interop coordination when

1346
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,440
you're on the other side of the world at

1347
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,280
times but uh

1348
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,079
we

1349
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,760
i do intend to work with andre and get

1350
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,520
in uh interop

1351
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,440
with drip to drip uh maybe 114 is the

1352
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,960
answer maybe it isn't i'm not quite sure

1353
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,839
but as 114 draws closer we'll have a

1354
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,960
