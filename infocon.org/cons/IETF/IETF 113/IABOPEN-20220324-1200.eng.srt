yourself familiar with that

27
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,360
this is the rules uh um how we work

28

together and contribute here in the ietf

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,239
there's also a link to the um code of

30
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,080
conduct so this is also something that i

31
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
would like to have everybody on their

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,839
meetings

36
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,599
okay um what is ibo maybe you have an

37
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,280
idea about this because you are already

38
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
in the room um but our idea about this

39
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
is that we as the ib really want to have

40
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,200
some interchange with the community we

41
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,879
would like to give you a good impression

42
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,319
about what we're doing especially from

43
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,480
the technical point of view

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,360
and

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
i just lost connectivity but you're

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,599
from a from a technical point of view

47
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,840
you can stick with the previous slide um

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,360
but we're also looking for actually

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,879
getting feedback from you and having an

50
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,319
exchange in communication with the

51
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,159
community so thank you for being here

52
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,400
next slide um this is also mainly kind

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,040
of for the proceedings just to make sure

54
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,200
beyond this session how you that you

55
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,959
know how to interact with us we have a

56
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,480
couple of mailing lists

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
um the easiest way to reach the iap is

58
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,799
just send an email to the iab be aware

59
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,879
that um this mailing list has a few more

60
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,720
people than just the core ib so that's

61
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
why this is listed on here

62
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,238
um you can also send an email to me or

63
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,959
any ib member individually if you want

64
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,120
like an open mailing list with community

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,280
discussion um it's best to go to

66
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,360
architecture just discuss this is also

67
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,680
hosted by the iab and we use it for

68
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,199
various cases

69
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,120
um there's a bunch of mailing lists for

70
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
not a bunch because we only have two

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
programs there's our programs related

72
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
meetings for most specific topics

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
and if you have any kind of questions

74
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
feedback

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,560
or other things related to liaisons we

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,800
have an own mailing list there

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,960
um that's the easiest way to reach the

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,520
right people in the iab

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,560
okay

80
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,639
next slide

81
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,720
okay now we're starting um a little bit

82
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,800
of just like an official reporting about

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,960
what we're doing in terms of documents

84
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
workshops and programs

85
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
and i will start with this slide on the

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,120
the documents we are working on what we

87
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,880
have published recently

88
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,199
um so we did publish one rfc since the

89
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,800
last meeting

90
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
that was

91
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,400
a lot of discussion about this was in

92
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,720
the edm program but we also it was also

93
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
presented in this ib open meeting at

94
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,160
some point i think

95
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,560
so that's out and published

96
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
we adopted a new document in the iab

97
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,080
since the last meeting that's the ib

98
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,400
pass signals collaboration draft

99
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,160
and there's some discussion ongoing on

100
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,479
the architecture discussion list so if

101
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,160
you're interested in that work that's

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,520
the right mailing list and we're happy

103
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,320
to get your feedback on this

104
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
um

105
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,240
there is the output of the rrc

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,919
editor program

107
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,720
which is um ready to be published

108
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
and i will say more about this in one of

109
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,280
the next slides and there is one

110
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,680
document which is under discussion um by

111
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,479
the edm program this is already an iap

112
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,639
document which has been around for more

113
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,479
than two years i think but it hasn't

114
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
made a lot of progress but there's some

115
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
work on this going on again so hopefully

116
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,880
we can publish that at some point

117
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,840
there's

118
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
one new workshop report and we will hear

119
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,000
about this next and there's an update on

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,720
the

121
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,039
workshop report from our workshop last

122
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,840
summer about network

123
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,720
measurements or network quality

124
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,520
measurements i guess

125
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
yeah program updates

126
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,440
so uh we have

127
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,600
two to three technical programs i would

128
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,080
say

129
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
sure

130
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,080
let's try it this way we have uh two to

131
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,000
three technical programs one of them is

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,280
edm

133
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,160
um

134
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
they presented a lot of their discussion

135
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,000
and work over the last couple of iab

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,600
open meetings and this time we only have

137
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,479
a quick

138
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,560
one slide update

139
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,199
so as i just mentioned um rfc 9170 is

140
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,960
published and that was discussed and

141
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
worked in this program

142
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,319
and there was an interim meeting of this

143
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,400
program beginning of february

144
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,639
where they talked about this related

145
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,160
implementation text so that's something

146
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,520
that is already in the data tracker and

147
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,440
you can use it in order to make it

148
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,520
easier to find um related

149
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,960
implementations

150
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,840
code

151
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
for indirect testing and these kind of

152
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,199
things so this is something new in the

153
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,560
data tracker that came out of the

154
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
discussion of the program

155
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
and then they are working on this other

156
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,479
draft about protocol maintenance that i

157
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,960
was also mentioning early on

158
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
so if you have any input on the second

159
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
draft here then this is the program and

160
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,319
the program writing list is the right

161
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,880
place to go

162
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,039
the internet threat motor program yeah

163
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,479
are you

164
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,039
with us online do you want to unmute

165
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,240
yourself and say something

166
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,319
i am

167
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
thank you

168
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,280
so

169
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,479
this is

170
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,120
a program looking at the changes on the

171
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,039
treadmills

172
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,520
in the in the internet uh we had an

173
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
entry meeting um

174
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,199
after the previous itf

175
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,520
we've had actually three documents being

176
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,560
updated uh since last time

177
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,160
there's been some discussion on mailing

178
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,240
list not a huge amount but some and

179
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
i think we're converging on

180
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,599
trying to publish a couple documents on

181
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,400
we call principles or documents

182
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
describing principles

183
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,479
around data minimization and involvement

184
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,560
of intermediaries

185
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,199
um the work remains on that and also we

186
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,279
have a bigger question of do we actually

187
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,279
want to update the official itf threat

188
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,880
model which

189
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,279
you know the iab to begin with cannot do

190
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,479
and and exactly what lengths so we go to

191
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,320
do that and so on

192
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,560
that that still remains to be decided

193
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
you can participate in the discussion on

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,880
the main list uh the link is here and we

195
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,519
have a poll for the next meeting time up

196
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,240
on the on the mailing list right now so

197
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,600
planning to do that in the next couple

198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,519
of weeks

199
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
that's it

200
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,920
thanks yari

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,040
okay and then our

202
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
third program and i cannot see any

203
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,760
screen

204
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,600
this one

205
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,120
yeah now i can see it

206
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,680
um so our third program uh this is a

207
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,120
little bit a different program that's an

208
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
ib program but it was

209
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,120
really run like an open working group

210
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,959
for everybody to participate participate

211
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,760
and we left the process on their own

212
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,399
we're just committed to host that

213
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,640
and and take their output and the good

214
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
news is and i already announced in the

215
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,080
planner yesterday but just to spread the

216
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,360
news a little bit more

217
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
and the program basically concluded

218
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
their work so they finished um the draft

219
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
and they headed back to the iab for iab

220
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,760
approval the iab made a four weeks

221
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,519
community last call in order to reach

222
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,640
out to

223
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,000
more of the community get different

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,160
reviews in and we triggered a lot of

225
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,279
reviews and and got some final feedback

226
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,920
made mostly editorial small changes um

227
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,120
[Music]

228
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
so i'm very confident that this is in a

229
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,440
good shape now and we are ready to

230
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
publish that basically

231
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
there is a dependency from the model

232
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
itself to three other drafts which are

233
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
on the ietf stream and which are updates

234
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,240
to existing process documents

235
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,519
um these have have already been on the

236
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,560
iesg agenda

237
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,320
but then we discovered like a small

238
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,160
update that is still needed to the iap

239
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,480
charter so this update to the ib charter

240
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
goes through another itf um working

241
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,120
group not working group last call itf

242
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,240
last call

243
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,120
and as soon as and and we'll also get um

244
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,279
additional approval by isoc by the iso

245
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,120
board because they approved the ib

246
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,640
charter in the first place so we asked

247
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
them to take a look at this again

248
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,040
just to to check and with everybody who

249
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,720
could be related here

250
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,279
um but as soon as that document is ready

251
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
basically the whole set of documents is

252
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,959
ready

253
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,399
the whole set of why is it working

254
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
yeah okay

255
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,760
something's just changed i don't know

256
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,519
what

257
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,160
maybe they did okay um so the whole set

258
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,000
of documents should be ready

259
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,959
uh and go out very soon in a few weeks

260
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,360
um so at this point it's merely a thank

261
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,959
you for ever to everybody who was

262
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,640
involved especially the chairs the

263
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,440
editor but also everybody who

264
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
provided feedback in the mailing list

265
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,839
was involved in the discussion and

266
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,600
provided reviews thank you very much

267
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,760
this was a lot of effort but at the end

268
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
we managed to work together productively

269
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,519
and i think got a good output here

270
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,800
yeah and then we will close down the

271
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,680
program at some point

272
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,920
okay leona updates um not sure wes if

273
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
you want to take this one if you are

274
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,959
here

275
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,079
yes i am here and i agreed to do it so i

276
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,560
should do it um so

277
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
as everybody may remember uh the ieb is

278
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,399
responsible for the liaison outreach or

279
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,760
at least overseeing the laser on

280
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
outreaches to a lot of other standards

281
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,040
organizations

282
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,519
we created a liaison coordinator role in

283
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,440
the last year and

284
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
tommy and i have been

285
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
fulfilling that role

286
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,000
i will

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,160
step down and deborah will actually take

288
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,120
over

289
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,800
but this is essentially the liaison

290
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,959
updates for what has happened at least

291
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,440
recently since the last ietf it is worth

292
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
noting that in the future we actually

293
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,320
hope to have uh sort of more mini

294
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
presentations in the iab open meeting or

295
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,600
something we've been discussing lately

296
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,920
so if you're interested in hearing more

297
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
about you know a particular standards

298
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,200
organization or other we may start

299
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,959
dedicating some time we'd love to love

300
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,639
your feedback on that

301
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,480
um the multi-stakeholder platform on ict

302
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
standardization is up for renewal we

303
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,560
need

304
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,800
we need to fill that role

305
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,160
the the icann sec has published 113

306
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,920
which calls for the icann board to

307
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
ensure a dns label is reserved for

308
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,160
private use this has been heavily

309
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,399
discussed in the past in dns op and in

310
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
other places as well

311
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,440
the the ietf has the

312
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,760
the oversight of special uses names and

313
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,399
there's a lack of clarity on exactly who

314
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,800
should be creating a name that might be

315
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,399
used for private label space in the same

316
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,639
way that we have private address space

317
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,240
there exists nothing at the moment and a

318
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
lot of companies and organizations squat

319
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
on names so uh look forward to

320
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,639
discussions on that both within i can

321
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,279
end the atf

322
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,839
the uh stuart did you have a question

323
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
related to liaisons

324
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,920
uh just uh wanted to mention that the

325
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
drip working group is probably going to

326
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
need some help establishing liaison with

327
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
astm international

328
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
and international civil aviation

329
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,839
organization

330
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,600
okay great uh why don't you write the

331
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
ieb with a note of of what you think you

332
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,279
need and things like that and then we

333
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,279
will certainly reach out to you so but

334
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,560
go ahead and write iab ib.org and we'll

335
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,320
all get to see it so

336
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,760
you can write the liaison coordinators

337
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
directly if you want to but

338
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,480
for something like that we're going to

339
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,680
have a discussion anyways you might as

340
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,399
well write the entire iab

341
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,600
the i can root server system advisory

342
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,639
committee which is rsac um is seeking

343
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,800
you know information on

344
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,160
um

345
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,199
the

346
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,360
their plans in order to publish the zone

347
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,320
md record which is a record designed

348
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,079
within the ietf for

349
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,160
providing a checksum on the entire root

350
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,760
zone content so that you can be aware

351
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,600
that you got the entire file

352
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,160
as well as there's no missing records in

353
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
the entire thing for large scale data

354
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,430
transfers used especially in things like

355
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,720
[Music]

356
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
rfc 8806 which is

357
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,760
a local copy of the root zone for

358
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,120
example to ensure that you have a

359
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
complete file

360
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,120
it's used well in conjunction with dnsec

361
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
it's not a replacement for it

362
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
uh and then our second 58 is success

363
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
criteria for the root server system

364
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,959
governance model

365
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,920
which

366
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,399
a while ago icann took on the role of

367
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,880
right now the root server system is

368
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,199
consists of 12 organizations that don't

369
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,959
have an overarching governance model

370
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
over them and then um

371
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
icann has been thinking for a number of

372
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,040
years now about how to create such a

373
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,440
thing and they created the gwg

374
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,639
uh ted hardy is and

375
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,680
jeff houston have been our iab liaisons

376
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,880
to the gwg uh ted unfortunately has to

377
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,199
step down uh he actually has been the

378
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,720
chair of the gwd and has done an

379
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,800
excellent job and we certainly thank

380
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,279
ted for his service we are looking for a

381
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,600
replacement uh the deadline for

382
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,720
volunteering for um such a role is

383
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,560
monday the

384
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,199
march uh sorry april 4th

385
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,839
2022 obviously so please do consider

386
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,600
volunteering for that role if you have

387
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,440
interest in overseeing

388
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,680
and helping create sort of the the next

389
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,240
root server system governance model

390
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,440
any questions

391
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,839
barry

392
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,519
this is barry lieber i'm on sac and was

393
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,240
in the uh work party that developed sac

394
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,440
113.

395
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
i just wanted to clarify something

396
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,399
because it's my understanding from what

397
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,600
we wrote that this is not in the ietf's

398
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,680
territory anymore that the ietf clearly

399
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,160
said you didn't want to go there

400
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,279
so

401
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,279
this is just a request to the icann

402
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,279
board to take care of this

403
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,320
so i'm sure there'll still be

404
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
discussions within the ietf but i don't

405
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,560
think anybody's asking the ietf to take

406
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,399
any action at this point

407
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,720
is that your understanding as well

408
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,480
that is my understanding that being said

409
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,399
the icann board has actually talked to

410
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,800
the iab about getting advice on how to

411
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
do this sort of thing so

412
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,759
uh there still is sort of some confusion

413
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,880
in terms of

414
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
what the icann board can do without the

415
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,519
ietf's help even if it's not the ats

416
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,000
belly wick it's a weird problem

417
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
okay thanks for the clarification

418
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,600
yeah we could discuss that all day as

419
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,720
you well know

420
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,680
lima

421
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,839
so lars lemon here

422
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,519
from net node one of the root server

423
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,920
operators and also a member of the dwg

424
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,839
from the root server side

425
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,000
i

426
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,640
the root service system advisory

427
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,520
committee in icann uh asked the icon

428
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,919
board to create this working group and

429
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,599
asked it specifically to be very

430
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,199
inclusive

431
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,599
because uh the root server operators per

432
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,000
se did not want to create their own

433
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,520
future they didn't want to be king

434
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,359
makers of themselves

435
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,799
so therefore we

436
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,839
reached out to a wider community and

437
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,679
there is a lot of representation inside

438
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,000
the icon community itself

439
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
but there are also certain aspects

440
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,320
especially the technical ones where we

441
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,200
would

442
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,120
value the input from the technical

443
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,320
community

444
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,600
if if

445
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
even if it's not more than sitting there

446
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,720
with the your foot on the brake pedal

447
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,160
when we're heading in the totally wrong

448
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,320
directions that that would be valuable

449
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,360
in itself so uh please consider applying

450
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,679
for this position and please uh

451
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,280
help us to to

452
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,919
maintain a relationship with the

453
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,400
technical community thank you

454
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,760
yeah thank you

455
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,600
very well put full disclosure i'm a root

456
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,160
server operator too for uscisi

457
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,200
um

458
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,440
one other point of comment which is that

459
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,480
the

460
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,280
whatever comes out of the gwg will be a

461
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
public document um published by icann

462
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,039
when that will mean that it will go

463
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,280
through a comment period and as leemon

464
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,760
just indicated the wider review of such

465
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,160
a document the better so

466
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
with that i believe i am done with this

467
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
slide

468
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,640
thank you

469
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,880
um so that is the reporting part here

470
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,840
and we can start with the fun part

471
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,320
we have one more report

472
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
sorry but maybe more detailed one about

473
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
our last workshop when analyzing ietf

474
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,720
data and these will take this and then

475
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,799
the rest of the session we have some

476
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,799
time to discuss about centralization

477
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,160
that is a topic

478
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,120
that comes up very often

479
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
and there's a lot of community interests

480
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,400
also topic that's discussed a lot in the

481
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
iab and we have like a couple of small

482
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,559
presentations to kind of set the stage

483
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,640
but hopefully we'll have enough time

484
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,880
for community discussion after the

485
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,679
presentations yes niels great to have

486
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,120
you here you can take over

487
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,240
okay let me try

488
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,039
i have to share slides

489
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,880
we have your slides already

490
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,200
yeah but jared is controlling them still

491
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,960
oh i can do now too never mind hello all

492
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,720
and uh

493
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,200
hello from sunny amsterdam not too far

494
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,919
i'm here to report back on the analyzing

495
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,600
ietf data workshop that we held already

496
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,400
in november december last year

497
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
it was hosted at the university of

498
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,840
amsterdam with a program committee of

499
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,039
colin perkins coryn kath mirja kulavin

500
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,960
sinbin lee and wes hartaker

501
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,799
our question was there is a

502
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,840
wealth of ietf data but how can this be

503
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,320
used to improve the ietf processes

504
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,919
create better standards that see more

505
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,480
implementation eight ietf leadership

506
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,720
authors and community members and

507
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,440
increase ietf legitimacy

508
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,960
and as a

509
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,520
subsidiary objective how to create a

510
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,919
community around the people that use

511
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,159
this data create tooling and make it

512
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,400
accessible for more people

513
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
and we did not come up on this on the

514
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,320
fly because also in the ietf

515
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,559
administrative strategic plan it says

516
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,000
that increasingly data should inform uh

517
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,840
policymaking

518
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,760
and so what we did is that we organized

519
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,640
a hackathon which unfortunately due to

520
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,840
cove it was not on site but was online

521
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,240
we had a four-day workshop out of which

522
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,559
two were a hackathon also inspired on

523
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,799
the experiences we had at the ietf with

524
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,880
the hackathon but thus far that wasn't

525
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,600
done during an iab workshop so on the

526
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,000
first day and the last day we had

527
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,720
sessions but on the middle two days we

528
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
worked in distributed groups on

529
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,799
different issues of which i will give a

530
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,360
short overview very short

531
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
so first we gave an overview of all the

532
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,679
itf data sources that there are such as

533
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,640
the mailing list archives the rfc index

534
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
the the data tracker and robert sparks

535
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,559
was there as well also provided an

536
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,799
excellent overview and

537
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,400
shared some notes that are definitely

538
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
very useful to review if you want to

539
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,320
have a look at this the ietf org web

540
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
page visitor stats github and interrupt

541
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,880
testings and survey data but this could

542
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,520
also be combined with data of other sdos

543
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,640
to provide more insights

544
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
and then the tools to analyze this there

545
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,159
are some really interesting tools that

546
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,880
are linked in the slides the ietf data

547
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,080
library as it has been developed by

548
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,440
colin perkis his team and his projects

549
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
the big bang project

550
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,919
uh that's been on this for a while rfc

551
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,799
prolog database and of course yadi arcos

552
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,960
author stats and ietf document

553
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
statistics there are a lot there's a lot

554
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
of data and a lot of tools to work with

555
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,280
but

556
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,960
also a lot of things that we don't use

557
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,720
and don't know yet so that was also a

558
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,240
part of trying to understand what do we

559
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,720
know what can we do and what is lacking

560
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
in the first session we

561
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,919
observed

562
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,760
and tried to understand affiliations and

563
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,240
industry control in standardization try

564
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,600
to understand what are the relations

565
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,960
between corporate interest and

566
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,880
individual contributions and

567
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,760
competitions between leadership

568
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,840
and that really flowed up super nicely

569
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,240
in the hackathon on work done on initial

570
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,919
analysis on affiliation trends in

571
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,400
mailing list participation a lot of work

572
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,360
done on a stakeholder analysis of

573
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,440
stakeholder categories and groups and

574
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,240
initial comparison between ietf and 3gpp

575
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
data so that uh

576
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,919
that resulted in some new data models in

577
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,679
uh some hand-picking of uh of top

578
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,480
contributors to several mailing lists to

579
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,880
uh to set a bit of a gold standard then

580
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
work by nick doty to see if that could

581
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,960
also be done odd in an automated fashion

582
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,919
and compare the hand coded one with the

583
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,480
automated coded one and then some work

584
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,720
by

585
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,919
sebastian benthal to see if we're from

586
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,000
mailing list data we could actually

587
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,880
retrieve uh affiliation and then compare

588
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,360
that also with data tracker data and the

589
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,840
hand-picked data so there was a lot of

590
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,600
a lot of collaboration going on and

591
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
working there and then we could actually

592
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,679
use that data on uh 3gpp data so that

593
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,760
was really and this was the work done by

594
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,120
christoph becker so it's really

595
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,600
interesting how this opened this work on

596
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,400
ietf data also opened insight into other

597
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
standards bodies

598
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,679
then another session was on community

599
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,360
and diversity

600
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,159
asking who is in the ietf who is not

601
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,159
there what is the what is the existing

602
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,880
diversity can trends and reasons for

603
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,120
that be found in data and what could be

604
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,159
different if diversity had been stronger

605
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,400
so any discussions and hacking we looked

606
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,760
at what could be measured and what

607
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,360
cannot be in existing tools but also in

608
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,039
uh

609
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,480
in current

610
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,120
nlp approaches the studying of general

611
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,880
identification country region

612
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,480
participation and tenure and

613
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,279
considerations of privacy and ethics and

614
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,960
initial results

615
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,799
show different kinds of participation in

616
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,799
different groups

617
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,640
confirmed

618
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
something that we of do we already know

619
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
about a lack of diversity in

620
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,440
during several meetings

621
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,679
and then another session looked at the

622
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,880
publication process and decision making

623
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,559
especially how decisions are made at the

624
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,799
ietf how can these decisions be studied

625
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,480
and how can these be used to improve

626
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,799
decision making and also help authors

627
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,279
and leadership make better choices and

628
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,360
to lead to how can we make better input

629
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,600
and output documents to understand who

630
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,400
writes the rfcs and how does this

631
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,120
contribute to them passing

632
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,360
try to understand doing data driven

633
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,919
mining of homophilic users requirements

634
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,279
of natural language processing to

635
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,600
understand the decision making process a

636
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,840
deployment measurement of course so how

637
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,200
does the relationship between a

638
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,679
successful rfc and its deployment and

639
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,039
measuring efficient

640
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,760
efficience of rfc development process so

641
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,840
what are common delays and also when

642
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,880
does working group last call take place

643
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,080
also there was some uh

644
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,240
some really interesting work being done

645
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,919
there and what i think are the most oh

646
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,919
sorry and then some really interesting

647
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,760
work on environmental sustainability on

648
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,840
which not a lot of hacking has been done

649
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,000
but some really interesting papers were

650
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,919
presented on

651
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,600
actually the lack of discussion of

652
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,279
sustainability in ietf drafts but also

653
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,640
the co2 emissions of ietf meetings and

654
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,480
how these could or should be taking into

655
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
consideration with the environmental

656
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,360
crisis right ahead of us

657
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,320
so some observations is that there was

658
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,960
really well attended the papers were

659
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,720
really good were really a pleasure to

660
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,120
read and the participation was extremely

661
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,039
diverse iab members ietf leadership

662
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,039
social scientists data scientists

663
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,440
computer scientists and the mix of

664
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,320
sessions and hackathon

665
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,159
work really well so there were new

666
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,960
collaborations code and tool chains were

667
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,120
tried and tested and people have are now

668
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,279
using each other's codes to write papers

669
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,679
and do things and no research questions

670
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,919
have been developed and i think that's

671
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,320
really nice so this also provided for

672
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
ourselves for a basis of our research

673
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,880
agenda for ietf data to inform future

674
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,559
research and development

675
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,520
um

676
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,200
there are people

677
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,240
working in different new collaborations

678
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,080
working on new papers and new workshops

679
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,840
but because it was so well and this

680
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,159
brought together such a unique group we

681
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,480
have a follow-up workshop under

682
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
discussion on this topic but that needs

683
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,760
further understanding of who can

684
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,000
organize what how the

685
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,679
pandemic is developing because it would

686
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,559
be really nice to do it in person and

687
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,760
further discussions with iab leadership

688
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,400
so if you want to have a thorough look

689
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,960
at who did what during the workshop

690
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,240
please have a look

691
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
at the papers

692
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,279
but also at the slides that were

693
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,760
presented during the sessions but also

694
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,080
the outcomes of the hackathon i'll also

695
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,919
have slides and these can be found on

696
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:18,880
github

697
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,480
we have a draft report there it's a zero

698
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,600
zero

699
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,679
but here is the link to the github so

700
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,720
you can have prs and comments etc and

701
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,760
there is also a video recording of the

702
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,320
whole workshop so if i missed anything

703
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,080
please other program committee members

704
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,480
of people who participate please add or

705
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,799
if there are any questions i'm happy to

706
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,720
seek to answer them or answer them

707
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,840
together with other people who are

708
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,880
present

709
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,840
thanks so much that was it from

710
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
me yeah thank you niels and yeah this

711
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,440
was really nice to see this was the

712
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,039
first time we had an ib workshop with a

713
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,320
hackathon

714
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,919
component and there was a lot of work

715
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,200
going on so

716
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
really nice workshop i think and we have

717
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,960
somebody in the queue alien

718
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,279
good afternoon uh

719
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,960
good morning and good evening to you

720
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
colleagues um niels thanks for the

721
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,760
update uh on this workshop i

722
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,480
saw a lot of slides go by that explained

723
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,880
what transpired at the workshop and what

724
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,000
the next steps were i wonder if you or

725
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,559
other people who participated could take

726
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,000
just a moment

727
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,360
and and provide maybe your top two or

728
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,000
three insights in terms of what you

729
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,720
learned about how we participate or

730
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,679
what what was confirmed or what what

731
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,799
misconceptions people had that the data

732
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,720
wore out not to be true

733
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,840
um could you comment on that

734
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,279
uh

735
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,279
yes but unfortunately not with a full

736
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,039
answer because people came in with

737
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,559
different research interests and

738
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,520
different questions and i think where we

739
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,320
uh

740
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,399
where we focused on was trying to

741
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,000
understand the data and the issues

742
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,760
people are working on to have an

743
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,360
understanding of the problem and

744
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,880
understand how the things could be

745
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,679
approached so we were by no means in

746
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,120
these days to a full understanding of uh

747
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,679
of particular issues and i wouldn't want

748
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,600
to

749
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,159
talk for other participants to say what

750
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,360
are the conclusions of that workshop

751
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
that was definitely not the nature of

752
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
the workshop it was the first time we we

753
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
did this so i think like establishing a

754
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,360
community establishing a research agenda

755
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,840
establishing research questions and it

756
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,279
would be way too early to say we would

757
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,840
have answers to them but what could be

758
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,760
said is that some of the code is now

759
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,240
being used to try if we could generate

760
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,919
dashboard kind of features similar such

761
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,000
to the ones author stats and document

762
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,679
stats is doing

763
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,080
and a bit more of an

764
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,880
web interface to

765
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,640
do data science on uh uh on mailing

766
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,360
lists and standards but that is also all

767
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,039
future work so it sparked a lot of

768
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,960
interesting things but answers are not

769
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,120
done

770
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,120
yeah last second i would second that so

771
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,039
i participated in this workshop as a as

772
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,960
an individual i guess and and it was

773
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,799
very much like a workshop with the

774
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,480
emphasis on the work part right so this

775
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,000
is not like where you see a joint

776
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,120
statement come out at the end or

777
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,559
something so this is about

778
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,080
getting people together oftentimes for

779
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,440
the first time and trying to understand

780
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,440
what everybody like has as an interest

781
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,919
and has us data and has his motivation

782
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,360
and i kind of expect this will be sort

783
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,960
of an ongoing thing in some way and i

784
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,159
don't know if it's always going to be an

785
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,600
iab workshop or if there's some other

786
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,760
way to continue this but it's

787
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,919
certainly not done after after this one

788
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,240
event right but it's it's really helpful

789
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,320
um to put in the leadership cap on to

790
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,000
have actually data about a bunch of

791
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,960
stuff

792
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,640
especially during covet where it's sort

793
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,440
of

794
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,720
very difficult to get a sense from the

795
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,919
community because there's no physical

796
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,200
meeting where you bump into people and

797
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,799
it'll tell you things right so we're

798
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,120
trying to

799
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,279
get some some insight into what we

800
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,360
should do in terms of decisions through

801
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,840
efforts like this

802
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,240
thanks for organizing

803
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,960
hello this is shane um

804
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,320
this is very cool

805
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,519
uh

806
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,399
i wonder if during the work if there was

807
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,480
a lot of attention given to areas where

808
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,880
it was difficult to extract information

809
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,480
out of the data that you have

810
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,240
like are is is part of the intention to

811
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,080
make recommendations for

812
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,640
additional metadata or additional

813
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,840
data data

814
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,519
for for researchers or other people

815
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,840
excellent question so what what i think

816
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,799
was the preliminary analysis is that

817
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,159
data tracker

818
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,919
very nice

819
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,600
mailing lists very hard very messy

820
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,679
but what is the advantage of mailing

821
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,840
list is that many other organizations

822
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,000
also have mailing lists and many other

823
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,080
organizations don't have data tracker so

824
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
that makes them comparison harder but

825
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,240
then we could try to see if we can

826
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,720
enhance the um

827
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,880
the the mailing list data with the data

828
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,279
tracker data and then see if we can just

829
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,360
improve our whole thing there was also

830
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,799
uh talk and discussion and some

831
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,399
presentations on um

832
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,399
uh on knowledge graphs

833
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,200
and uh uh how that and how machine

834
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,720
learning can inform this process but

835
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,039
that that was still also also a

836
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,880
presentation about how many things did

837
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,279
not work as well as people hope

838
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,519
so um

839
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,519
so that continues to be

840
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,679
work uh there is a thing of course also

841
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,519
in the data tracker that many things are

842
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,760
text fields and not drop down so you

843
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
have many many different ways of even

844
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,000
just spelling cisco cisco systems so

845
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,840
with capitals you know so and

846
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
um so there were there were challenges

847
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,720
and what was so nice is that that robert

848
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,880
and others were there so

849
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,480
yeah it really felt like we were hacking

850
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,720
on a common problem so it was it didn't

851
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
feel like research community needed to

852
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
request leadership to tell the tools

853
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,000
people no it was like we were really

854
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,840
like i'm trying to understand and

855
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,519
wrapping our head out where we're going

856
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,159
what we're missing what we have

857
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,799
cool thank you

858
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,840
okay thank you niels

859
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,360
yeah we now have like four small

860
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,559
presentations let's take the

861
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,760
presentations and then have the

862
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,200
discussion afterwards because we're

863
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,519
already a little bit behind time but i'm

864
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,240
actually not sure for this presentation

865
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,039
if either matt or carl is in the room

866
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,640
i didn't see them in the list

867
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,640
um

868
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,720
yeah so then we actually

869
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,399
we gained some time but on that

870
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,720
presentation so that is work from isoc

871
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
um that did some market analysis about

872
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,679
centralization and uh as we don't have

873
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,440
the presenters here it's probably much

874
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,039
easier for you to just go on the isoc

875
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,600
web page and look at all the data there

876
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,240
firsthand it's very interesting and it

877
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,760
doesn't it does contribute to this

878
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,120
discussion

879
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,960
okay then uh no this is the wrong

880
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,880
presentation

881
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,679
the next should be from uh viet

882
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,480
who also did uh some measurements

883
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,800
so let's start with that part

884
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,879
yeah yes hello everyone

885
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,119
i think i still need control over the

886
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,560
slides

887
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,440
you can hand it over

888
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,000
okay now control nice

889
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,560
exactly cool thanks perfect so yeah

890
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,000
hello everyone my name is viet from

891
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,599
technology university of munich and

892
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,119
today i have the honor to present our

893
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,440
measurement study on web consolidation

894
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,520
here at the iab open meeting

895
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,839
this paper is covered by roland oliver

896
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,520
weipov and

897
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,159
was recently published in toit you can

898
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,918
find a link to the paper and all the

899
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,440
measurement related material on our

900
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,599
github repository as well as contact

901
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,960
information in case you have any

902
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,639
questions

903
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,440
so

904
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,280
as already mentioned before

905
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,880
in the recent years you've probably also

906
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
seen that there has been increasing

907
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
demand for measurement studies on

908
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,040
internet centralization in particular

909
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,160
why is that

910
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,599
essentially because there are differing

911
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,839
opinions and views about centralization

912
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,119
on one hand

913
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,119
centralization obviously facilitates the

914
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,200
deployment of the protocols

915
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,040
on the other hand it makes it

916
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,599
somewhat risky for privacy and

917
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,599
is a concentration of control which is

918
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,520
obviously another good thing in a lot of

919
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,480
ways

920
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,280
and

921
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,599
that in a sense also makes difficult to

922
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,839
define centralization and to understand

923
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,320
and assess the extent

924
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,119
and implications of centralization

925
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,640
in the recent years there have been some

926
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,359
studies on centralization on dns

927
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,839
third-party dependencies and co-location

928
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,760
of services and in our paper in

929
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,160
particular we look at web consolidation

930
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,000
around what we call content delivery

931
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
infrastructures which is basically a

932
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,880
term which subsumes cdn and cloud hosts

933
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,160
under one term

934
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,240
cdi's for short

935
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,560
so what we first did in our paper is um

936
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,240
we looked at longitudinal dns

937
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,720
measurements for all domains in the dot

938
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,880
com.net and dot org

939
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,200
name spaces which were more than 160

940
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,440
million and we found that the cdi

941
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,760
penetration has increased from roughly

942
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,359
eight percent to

943
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,200
nearly double with fifteen percent in

944
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,640
twenty twenty

945
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,480
um fifteen percent in this case means

946
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,640
that fifteen percent of the uh websites

947
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,560
that we looked at um out of all the

948
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,839
measured ones

949
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,760
were uh hosted on a cdi and note that

950
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,680
the cdi identification

951
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,119
is obviously not an exhaustive

952
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,200
identification but it covers most of the

953
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,280
prominent providers that are out there

954
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,440
so this can be seen as a

955
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,920
lower bound one could say

956
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,480
in the next part we then looked at

957
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,880
popular landing pages in based on the

958
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,280
alexa top 1 million top list and see

959
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,079
that the overall penetration

960
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,839
is roughly 24 over pv4 and roughly 12

961
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,440
over ipv6 um with more popular domains

962
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,480
obviously

963
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
having a higher penetration since these

964
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,760
websites

965
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,920
are simply facing more traffic and um

966
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,640
are in more need of this

967
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,960
infrastructure so to speak

968
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,240
in the bottom plot

969
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
you can see the contribution of

970
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,560
providers in this case only the top

971
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,079
providers in this case to the overall

972
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,560
penetration and you can see that

973
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,240
it's only a handful of providers that

974
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,599
make up the

975
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,839
most amount of uh

976
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,760
contribution to this overall penetration

977
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,560
in particular of ipv6 where we see that

978
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,760
for instance for the alexa top 100 000

979
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,720
for ipv6 cloudflare contributes

980
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
roughly 80 of the

981
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,240
pages of all cdi hosted pages so

982
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,839
while there is some concentration that

983
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,280
you can see there

984
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,359
it definitely helps with in this case

985
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,000
pushing ipv6

986
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,320
then also went beyond landing pages

987
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,560
where we looked at page resources

988
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,880
for that we used page load measurements

989
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,119
from the hp archive which covered uh

990
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,480
more than four million websites and

991
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,440
roughly 400 million resources and we saw

992
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,920
that roughly one third of the pages were

993
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,400
hosted on the cdi

994
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,560
and in contrast more than 50 of the

995
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,960
resources that were loaded with together

996
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,560
with the pages were actually coming from

997
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
a cdi

998
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,240
in the top table right here you can see

999
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,960
that

1000
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,200
google and amazon in particular account

1001
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,920
for together more than 50 of the cdi

1002
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,800
hosted resources so while

1003
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,119
more than half of the resources in total

1004
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,480
come from a cdi um more than 50

1005
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,079
quality come from google and amazon in

1006
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,640
particular so there's definitely some

1007
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,800
you could say top heavy distribution

1008
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,320
there

1009
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,720
in the bottom table you can also see

1010
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,040
the penetration by resource type which

1011
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,520
is especially high for static resources

1012
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,839
which is sort of expected since

1013
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,920
cdns in particular are used for

1014
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,800
distribution of static resources a lot

1015
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,640
however we see for instance that phones

1016
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,960
have 86 percent of our cdr penetration

1017
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,440
which is definitely a very high number

1018
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,599
and in our paper we also cover case

1019
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,800
studies on

1020
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,359
cdi penetration which is also similarly

1021
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,680
high for ads and trackers and for tls

1022
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,920
1.3 support

1023
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,400
to briefly conclude this

1024
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,280
as

1025
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,720
mentioned this is just a brief overview

1026
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,000
of our paper

1027
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,240
we have seen that the consolidation of

1028
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,079
webpages around certain cdis has

1029
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,040
increased by roughly double since 2015

1030
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,720
and that most of the resources are

1031
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,359
delivered from just a handful of cdis

1032
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,760
mostly

1033
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,240
this obviously also means that there are

1034
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,160
some risks with this but on the other

1035
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,800
hand it also helps with the deployment

1036
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,760
and support of ipv6 and tls 1.3 as we've

1037
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
briefly showed

1038
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,920
um also as media as mentioned before

1039
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,400
there was some um quite some discussion

1040
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,599
on the architectural discuss mailing

1041
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,760
list which i definitely recommend you to

1042
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,960
have a look into if you're more

1043
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,480
interested in that

1044
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
i've put some of the

1045
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,720
i guess main questions and comments from

1046
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,200
the discussion here on the slide and i

1047
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,839
guess the most important or most

1048
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,599
interesting one would be what is the

1049
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,960
impact of and on itf activities um

1050
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,800
around all the centralization

1051
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,440
and i believe mark has some comments on

1052
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,880
this on the next talk so unless there

1053
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,640
are any questions

1054
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,079
um

1055
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,160
i would conclude here

1056
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,680
yeah we have somebody in the cube but i

1057
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,880
would actually like to go through the

1058
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,040
other presentations quickly and then we

1059
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,480
take the question so christians just

1060
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,880
stay in the queue and then uh you can

1061
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,960
just you can just unmute yourself when

1062
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,400
there's a question coming up anytime

1063
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,960
later okay perfect thanks thank you

1064
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,839
okay mark

1065
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
yeah you are up and you should be able

1066
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,280
to

1067
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,359
move yourself okay can you can you hear

1068
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,560
me

1069
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,160
yes

1070
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,640
okay how do i control these slides oh i

1071
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,720
see interesting okay

1072
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,520
weird okay um i don't think i'm going to

1073
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,680
need 10 minutes here but we'll see so um

1074
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,280
this is just a quick update on a draft

1075
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
i've been working on for a little while

1076
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
uh draft nottingham avoiding internet

1077
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,640
centralization although the title is

1078
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,119
centralization and internet standards

1079
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,040
um there we go

1080
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,800
so the purpose and a bit of the history

1081
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,119
here this was inspired by a draft that

1082
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,119
brian trammell and i started uh when we

1083
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,280
were both on the iab

1084
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,440
about choke points on the internet

1085
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,359
before this became quite such a big

1086
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,920
topic um and it never really got enough

1087
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,160
steam to actually be adopted by the iab

1088
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,640
we talked about it once or twice i think

1089
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,040
but the the topic stayed with me and and

1090
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,920
as

1091
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,520
we went on i thought i wanted to write

1092
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,839
more about it so here we are

1093
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,160
um and i very much want to keep the

1094
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,000
focus here on exploring how

1095
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,920
centralization relates to the internet

1096
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,680
standards community and our work

1097
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,760
um there is a lot more that can be

1098
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,119
talked about here and i know that it's

1099
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,520
it's something we return to fairly often

1100
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,680
uh around competition and economic

1101
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,560
factors and and so forth and so on but

1102
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,480
we we lack expertise and authority in

1103
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,200
those areas and and in in a lot of cases

1104
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,480
and one of the main points of the draft

1105
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,240
is is that you know while we see

1106
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,480
centralization happening we don't

1107
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
necessarily have the ability to prevent

1108
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,920
it with the tools that we have in our

1109
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,560
toolbox uh but but having said that

1110
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,319
there are still things we can do and so

1111
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,240
that's kind of the

1112
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,680
the area that the giraffe is trying to

1113
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,520
stake out and and and talk about

1114
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,560
um oh i see okay so this is the current

1115
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,599
table of contents um it starts by trying

1116
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,599
to define centralization with the

1117
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,800
american spelling uh it tries to uh talk

1118
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,640
about why it's not a great thing to have

1119
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,720
centralized internet protocols why we're

1120
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,520
trying to avoid it uh and and then it it

1121
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,359
offers a kind of a taxonomy of

1122
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,760
centralization of different kinds

1123
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,040
that that

1124
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,400
we've observed um this is

1125
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,839
as far as i'm aware original i haven't

1126
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,160
seen anyone else do this and and as i'll

1127
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,760
i think the next slide says i haven't

1128
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,599
gotten a lot of feedback on this uh

1129
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,520
which means either i got it great the

1130
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,359
first go or people haven't really looked

1131
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,880
at it i'm not sure which

1132
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,720
um so if folks have thoughts about that

1133
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,359
i'd love to hear it offline um then it

1134
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,119
talks about kind of you know there are

1135
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,560
some

1136
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,119
common conceptions about how

1137
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:30,880
decentralization can be brought by

1138
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,520
using certain techniques uh and it talks

1139
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,359
through why they are not

1140
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,079
magic bullets that can be used to solve

1141
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,400
centralization issues uh and then and

1142
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,720
then it concludes with a discussion of

1143
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,800
what we in this community you know might

1144
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,240
think about doing

1145
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,839
and and and and

1146
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,119
makes a couple of

1147
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,480
recommendations or at least explores a

1148
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,359
couple of areas where you know that can

1149
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,880
are suggestions of how to guide that

1150
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,960
discussion

1151
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,319
um so so far um all the interactions

1152
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,520
that i've had

1153
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,359
uh a lot of them have been private but

1154
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,119
it seems like there's pretty strong and

1155
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,880
broad interest in the topic

1156
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,640
uh and i've had a fair amount of

1157
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,640
encouragement to pursue this work which

1158
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,480
has kept me revising it about once a

1159
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,839
month right now

1160
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,280
um i've made a lot of tweaks and

1161
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,720
adjustments throughout based upon the

1162
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,319
feedback i've received

1163
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,119
uh and i think as i mentioned i haven't

1164
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,640
had a lot of substantial suggestions on

1165
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,560
the cons of centralization but a lot of

1166
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,760
the discussion has been around what

1167
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,520
should internet standards do and i think

1168
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,200
that needs some more development

1169
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,359
um and and i realized when i was putting

1170
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,480
these slides together i need to update

1171
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,200
the acknowledgement section as well

1172
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,440
so uh next steps

1173
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,960
my gut feeling is we're something like

1174
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,160
75 of the way there um we could spend a

1175
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,839
lot of time working in this area

1176
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,160
generally but i'd like to ship something

1177
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,800
and so i have some open issues i i'm

1178
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,640
getting some feedback so i saw yara gave

1179
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,599
some feedback which was quite

1180
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,680
interesting just about an hour ago

1181
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,520
which i think i'm gonna enjoy talking

1182
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,560
through with him and incorporating the

1183
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,680
document

1184
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,920
right now my plan is to submit it to the

1185
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,599
independent stream and i've been talking

1186
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,160
to the ise about that a little bit um

1187
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,240
but i do want to incorporate more review

1188
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,079
and feedback from the community

1189
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,319
and publish that relatively soon

1190
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,000
so um

1191
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,240
that's the the first url is is the the

1192
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,400
repo that i'm using to develop this

1193
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,000
issues and discussion there is more than

1194
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,960
welcome

1195
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,520
um and so far uh the public discussions

1196
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,599
happened on architecture discuss if the

1197
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,359
ib is happy to continue that i'm happy

1198
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,520
to continue to use that or i can try and

1199
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,599
get another mailing list if if if the

1200
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,839
iab doesn't want me to do that um and

1201
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,319
that's all i've got

1202
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,839
yeah thanks mark for the update and i

1203
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,280
think this is definitely a good million

1204
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,960
lining just to use

1205
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,839
um

1206
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,560
okay same thing we we take gary we have

1207
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,319
like one or two more slides and then we

1208
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,640
take the queue so you can unmute any

1209
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,319
time again mark or

1210
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,599
as soon as we have the questions yep

1211
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,680
and if you display my one slides there's

1212
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,079
only one actual slide this will be brief

1213
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,640
so we have some time for discussion so

1214
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,040
very much in the same vein as mark was

1215
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,000
uh

1216
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,280
talking about

1217
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,079
now

1218
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,920
so this is about the technical things

1219
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,800
that

1220
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,880
if you can go to the next slide

1221
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,119
technical things that we could do about

1222
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,079
some aspects of centralization and

1223
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,359
i don't want to go into the details of

1224
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,960
this um

1225
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,240
but i wanted to highlight that there's

1226
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,000
like two categories that

1227
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,440
the iab or or groups around the iab have

1228
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,319
talked about in in recent times one is

1229
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,960
data and how that gets accumulated in

1230
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,200
smaller number of hands

1231
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,000
and what can we do about that and

1232
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,359
the other one is various kinds of

1233
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,640
linkages how do you you know

1234
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,760
bundle os or device or browser and some

1235
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,000
application system some service services

1236
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,319
together and how you find

1237
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,640
the different components and how how

1238
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,040
tight those bindings are and there are

1239
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,680
things you can do about this um just to

1240
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,000
list on the right side a few

1241
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,760
things that the ietf has recently worked

1242
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,200
on so

1243
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,240
for

1244
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,880
data for instance oblivious dns or pre

1245
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,440
bpm type of solutions are

1246
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,359
one approach of course we can also try

1247
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,599
and eliminate some of the data don't

1248
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,200
send as much data

1249
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,480
but um

1250
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,920
there's other tools as well and then for

1251
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,720
these

1252
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,720
two type bindings you have discovery

1253
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,400
that discovery and modularity that you

1254
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,119
can

1255
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,160
apply and ddr is one good example of

1256
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,559
that coming out of the add working group

1257
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,839
so i think that's it for now you can

1258
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,319
look at the slide in more detail

1259
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,079
and we can go to discussion thanks

1260
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,559
thank you um

1261
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,040
yeah i mean actually yari mark and beat

1262
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,880
if you just want to stay there put your

1263
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,640
video on

1264
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,480
and we start the discussion we start the

1265
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,800
queue question

1266
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,480
uh thank you vanna i've been following

1267
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,800
your work for some time and it's it's

1268
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,559
great and uh

1269
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,119
i'd like to see that work um published

1270
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,800
and i mean

1271
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,119
i'd like to see that work given as much

1272
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,240
visibility as we can

1273
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,800
the um

1274
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,760
the the one thing i'd like to

1275
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,160
be clear about is

1276
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,960
whether we should measure cdn

1277
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,000
concentration by itself

1278
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,480
or as the

1279
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,480
part of the web delivery process

1280
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,079
when i do my

1281
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,920
own measurements which are not as

1282
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,079
extensive as yours i i do for example

1283
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,839
that if you look at the top

1284
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,599
sides

1285
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,760
one of the biggest provider of the top

1286
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,119
sides is

1287
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,839
wikipedia

1288
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,200
because

1289
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,119
media has

1290
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,359
an infrastructure that covers many

1291
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,240
countries etc etc and it's it becomes

1292
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,160
very visible

1293
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,760
now uh

1294
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,839
that kind of stuff i mean a big

1295
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,000
organization like wikipedia but the same

1296
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,400
is true for facebook or google or

1297
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,880
microsoft or many others

1298
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,280
it's also a delivery mechanism which

1299
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,680
actually competes with the various cdns

1300
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,960
with

1301
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,680
some kind of a closed market so

1302
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,040
i was wondering whether we should also

1303
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,559
assess

1304
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,400
the importance of stuff like that

1305
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,880
and

1306
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,440
so i i don't know if you want that so

1307
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,880
that was

1308
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,240
one question

1309
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
and the other question is that yes i

1310
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,079
mean we have to

1311
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,640
to go into this publication access also

1312
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,440
the the world of platforms we see the

1313
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,440
concentration happening in the

1314
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,760
underlying platforms i mean the

1315
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,880
the

1316
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,520
the place where the hosts are i mean

1317
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,480
being

1318
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,720
dns providers

1319
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,880
virtual network with virtual machine

1320
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,480
providers etc

1321
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,319
that's also something i

1322
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,599
should

1323
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,000
publish

1324
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,119
yeah thank you christian i think that

1325
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,319
wasn't really a question right

1326
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,240
now the question is basically how do we

1327
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,720
define these things okay like

1328
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,160
no it's not a question to answer it's an

1329
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,559
open question for the community okay

1330
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:23,920
yeah

1331
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,720
okay thank you then uh we take the next

1332
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,118
in the queue

1333
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,880
hi um and thanks for the presentations

1334
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,920
um prior to mark's uh draft mark

1335
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,640
mcfadden myself and um elliott has it

1336
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,280
have a draft it's still out there um

1337
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,920
revision three on centralization as well

1338
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,839
so i was thinking one way forward would

1339
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,119
be

1340
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,280
to have a reconciliation or have a look

1341
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,599
at our both of our drafts together and

1342
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,000
maybe see where each of us

1343
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,240
can fill in the holes uh and that's just

1344
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,000
something to think about going forward

1345
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,640
i'll post the the link here

1346
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,640
and also on the um

1347
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,040
also on the mailing list the other thing

1348
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,720
i just wanted to bring up

1349
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,480
just more generally maybe perhaps

1350
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,920
following on from

1351
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,200
yari's

1352
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,559
uh presentation is that uh steven in

1353
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,119
saad mentioned consolidation

1354
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,520
around protocols that are going from two

1355
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,839
to three different protocols um and

1356
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,119
that's something that i don't think has

1357
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,520
been looked at yet uh in terms of

1358
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,079
standardization here at the ietf so it's

1359
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,680
just another thought for something we

1360
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,920
can put together on on all these drafts

1361
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,839
so thanks thanks a

1362
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,119
lot thank you

1363
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,599
elliot

1364
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,040
hi again um

1365
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,480
all right a couple of things now first

1366
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,160
of all i think my name has fallen off

1367
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,800
that draft dominique um i had hoped to

1368
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,400
actually contribute but

1369
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,040
for various reasons mostly involving the

1370
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,119
rfc update process and a few other

1371
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,760
things i ran out of time and steam at

1372
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,640
the time that that that it was going

1373
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,640
um

1374
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,800
the other point i just wanted to make is

1375
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,920
um really channeling colin here

1376
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,119
um in that there was a workshop

1377
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,880
last year

1378
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,520
uh in the dnrg

1379
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,240
this is the uh there was a workshop on

1380
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,480
centralization in the internet

1381
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,319
um i will post the link into the chat

1382
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,559
it's probably good for anybody who's

1383
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,440
interested in this topic take a look at

1384
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,160
the presentations there

1385
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,240
and i'll just end with

1386
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,119
um

1387
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,960
while mark and i haven't indeed been

1388
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,599
talking um

1389
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,599
regardless of whether we decide to go

1390
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,200
forward in the independent stream if we

1391
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,720
do i'm certainly hoping that that

1392
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,480
wouldn't be the end of the conversation

1393
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,079
but more to spur additional conversation

1394
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,520
um both in the ietf and elsewhere

1395
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,720
this is a topic that extends well beyond

1396
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,040
the etf and other as ddrc and wise

1397
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,040
many other places where policy

1398
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,920
implications economics considerations uh

1399
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,040
this is something where i think we

1400
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,400
should reach across uh in order to to

1401
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,559
form better shared understanding thank

1402
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,559
you

1403
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,880
yes hi i'm victor

1404
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,760
well i just wanted to

1405
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,359
suggest that the iab

1406
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,119
takes a look at what i think is one of

1407
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,880
the key issues that are open around this

1408
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,480
centralization thing there are many

1409
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,520
aspects

1410
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,280
but the one that i've seen coming up

1411
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,720
around and around

1412
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,720
in the end in different forms is the

1413
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,319
relationship between the applications

1414
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,079
and the network there's a draft also in

1415
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,000
the list not in these three ones but it

1416
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,599
was in the agenda before

1417
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,839
on exchanging signals between the two

1418
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,920
applications and the network and this is

1419
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,599
really the key point

1420
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,839
because in the end i mean in the last 10

1421
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,760
years we've seen this trend

1422
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,520
the test performance centralization by

1423
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,119
taking functionalities that were

1424
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,119
traditionally provided by

1425
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,359
the network by let's say

1426
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,119
thousands of isps globally if you look

1427
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,720
at the global space hundreds of

1428
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,319
thousands of corporates that are

1429
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,559
providing network access and 200

1430
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,079
different governments scattered around

1431
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,920
the world and now these functions have

1432
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,000
been centralized into the hands of

1433
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,160
four browser makers two mobile operating

1434
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,599
system makers

1435
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,200
and i mean

1436
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,880
in terms of messaging maybe three four

1437
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,200
or five companies so

1438
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,119
globally this is really one of the the

1439
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,880
reasons why we're seeing this scenario

1440
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,119
and we're getting more and more of it as

1441
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,319
soon as we continue moving

1442
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,240
functionalities from the network to the

1443
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,599
application level

1444
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,520
so there should be

1445
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,240
an itf position idf idea of in the end

1446
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,760
where do we see in the long term the

1447
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,520
relationship between the applications

1448
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,119
and the network to be

1449
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,079
if any data on connections and

1450
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,599
activities has to be shared from the

1451
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,920
applications with the network operator

1452
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,040
or not

1453
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,640
under which conditions and part of this

1454
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,240
will be a policy decision so there will

1455
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,920
be i'm sure there will be regulators

1456
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,119
involved in these competition

1457
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:00,640
authorities there's so many other

1458
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,640
aspects which are not technical but at

1459
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,040
least if the fdf could come up with

1460
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,200
ways to do this communication when it's

1461
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,799
necessary when in the end it will be

1462
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,240
decided that it's necessary to share

1463
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,400
information and discussions on how to do

1464
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,400
it well rather than how to do it in a

1465
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,079
bad way i think this could be a

1466
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,920
contribution to advance the discussion

1467
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,839
thank

1468
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,599
you yeah as you said the the iab is

1469
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,480
working on a document here um i i see

1470
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,480
this mostly as a separate topic but as

1471
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,480
he also said there is a loose relation

1472
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,880
by by this trend to move up the stack

1473
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,799
and then having less players and there

1474
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,119
are pros and cons of that

1475
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,119
okay um

1476
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,599
php

1477
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,400
hi yes uh

1478
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,319
i

1479
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,240
centralization is the frame that we've

1480
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,760
received

1481
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,680
but that doesn't necessarily mean that

1482
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,160
that is the right frame through which we

1483
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,960
should be looking at this problem

1484
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,359
i don't worry about centralization

1485
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,720
itself

1486
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,280
i worry about walled gardens

1487
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,559
i worry about switching costs

1488
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,280
if i can switch from one vendor to

1489
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,400
another

1490
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,200
without having pain without having

1491
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,520
stickiness

1492
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,400
i don't care about the centralization

1493
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,920
so much

1494
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,440
if i can

1495
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,119
talk to somebody

1496
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,960
who is using a different messaging

1497
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,160
format i don't mind i don't worry so

1498
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,240
much

1499
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,480
on the social media side

1500
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,880
i'm not that worried about the

1501
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,839
publication side of things

1502
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,400
i'm worried about the curation side of

1503
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,400
things because

1504
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,160
it is the curation power of facebook

1505
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,799
that was abused

1506
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,359
to set an agenda

1507
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,680
that promoted a particular set of

1508
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,839
politics

1509
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,160
and so i think that we've got to be

1510
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,720
rather skeptical of the frame that we've

1511
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,079
given

1512
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,520
and address the real frames

1513
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,040
and those are actually the ones that we

1514
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,880
can do something about

1515
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,680
we we don't do economics here but we do

1516
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,359
do interoperable

1517
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,720
we could

1518
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,119
make internet accounts portable so you

1519
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,359
could take your email account from one

1520
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,240
vendor to another

1521
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,520
and we could have a decentralized

1522
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,680
um curation

1523
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,119
capability

1524
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,520
rss was originally designed for that

1525
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,280
yeah thank you i think this is very much

1526
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,559
the point of the discussion to figure

1527
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,880
out what we in this community could be

1528
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,000
doing

1529
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,359
and how we can move forward um

1530
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:42,799
we have carl in the queue who was

1531
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,280
supposed to uh present a few slides from

1532
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,240
isaac um but now he's here and so go

1533
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,480
ahead carl

1534
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,359
yes

1535
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,799
thank you very much and first of all

1536
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,200
apologies for for joining late i missed

1537
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,240
the time

1538
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,680
for jumping in

1539
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,839
but um i just wanted to flag that we've

1540
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,000
been uh working a little bit on this at

1541
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,920
the internet society for a few years

1542
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,839
thinking about consolidation and

1543
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:09,359
centralization and quite recently we

1544
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,559
launched

1545
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,880
a what we call a focus area kind of a

1546
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,780
thematic view

1547
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,040
[Music]

1548
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,079
on centralization on our pulse platform

1549
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,160
which is

1550
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,240
basically trying to curate information

1551
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,160
and data on different thematics and one

1552
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,200
of them being centralization

1553
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,839
and i won't go into much details

1554
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,839
about

1555
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,079
more about that background more than to

1556
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,680
say that

1557
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,839
what we're doing there in in the context

1558
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,599
of you know trying to break down this

1559
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,040
question of centralization what we're

1560
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,760
looking at specifically in that area is

1561
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,839
around market concentration

1562
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,760
for the provision of certain or specific

1563
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,920
technologies for for popular websites

1564
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,000
so we're collaborating with a partner

1565
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,040
called w3 tech that produces these web

1566
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,520
technology surveys basically querying a

1567
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,839
website looking at for a given set of

1568
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,520
technologies who are the providers

1569
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,720
involved

1570
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,680
and then we calculate a market share

1571
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,440
on that basis so the market share in

1572
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,760
this context is understood as the

1573
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,079
ratio of sites using a provider to all

1574
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,240
sites using that technology

1575
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,920
and that is a bit of a mouthful but

1576
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,839
effectively means if you have a sample

1577
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,640
in which 20 of the websites uses say

1578
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,240
cloudflare then cloudflare is given a 20

1579
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,760
market share

1580
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,079
and then we use those market shares to

1581
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,799
to calculate concentration metrics uh

1582
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,000
two of them

1583
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,760
one of them being the gini coefficient

1584
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,280
that you might be familiar with from

1585
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,839
other contexts like income inequality

1586
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,319
and one of them being hhi

1587
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:43,680
but the idea here is that we're

1588
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,880
interested

1589
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,760
in

1590
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,119
trying to come up with concentration

1591
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,240
measures

1592
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,920
for these different services and

1593
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,760
importantly kind of see where the trend

1594
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,359
is heading in what direction are we

1595
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,960
going

1596
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,119
so we launched this in december and is

1597
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,119
very much looking for feedback

1598
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,280
we received some very useful feedback

1599
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,160
from

1600
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,920
many people in the ietf community

1601
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,240
already that we've incorporated

1602
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,280
but we're definitely looking for more so

1603
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,880
encourage everyone to have a look at

1604
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,319
that

1605
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,640
that website scrutinize what we're doing

1606
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,599
and we very much welcome feedback to the

1607
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,359
pulse at icelock.org address thank you

1608
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,040
yeah thanks carl um

1609
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,200
glad that you made it i think this is a

1610
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,880
very valuable input to the discussion

1611
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,319
and i think all what we heard today is

1612
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:29,920
just like the start of discussion we

1613
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,480
need to have and we should have um so

1614
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,160
please go to the architecture this class

1615
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,040
mating list or contact the ib directly

1616
