whole week i'm so over excited and so

um right we have no takers

54
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,959
let's

55
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,320
that's

56
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
roughly our agenda

57
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,600
most of the

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,639
tickets are on

59
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,960
smtp couple tickets on

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,520
applicability statement at the end

61
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
and at some point i'll just do a quick

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
update on

63
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,639
email format

64
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,000
when pete is back in the room

65
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,479
so

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,199
i don't think we will be you uh we will

67
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,520
have to use the whole two hours but if

68
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,360
the discussion is productive and we're

69
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
making progress

70
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,720
that's fine um

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,280
is john

72
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
oh

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
okay

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,479
i don't see actually john clanson in in

75
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,080
the room at the moment he said he had

76
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,560
technical issues

77
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,160
yes maria i appreciate that it's 4 30 in

78
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,400
the morning so

79
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,680
um

80
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,479
right uh

81
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,479
so

82
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,919
while we're waiting

83
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,560
for john

84
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,280
i can quickly

85
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,039
i suppose i don't need pete for this

86
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,840
either so um basically email core

87
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,479
has

88
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,360
one ticket outstanding which is about

89
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,199
printable versus visible characters

90
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,560
um i will do a follow up on this i think

91
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,039
there is a valuable proposal that will

92
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,160
work basically suggestion is just to say

93
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
instead of

94
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,840
using possibly ambiguous terminology in

95
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,360
various contexts we're just going to say

96
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
which are character which is

97
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,360
um effectively the intent of the text

98
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
um

99
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,560
pete also has

100
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,520
um

101
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
one outstanding

102
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800
change related to trace header to which

103
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,639
he agreed a couple of months ago he just

104
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
didn't get around to doing this

105
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,720
once he pushes

106
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,199
a new revision

107
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,720
we will be starting working group

108
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,720
colonet

109
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,160
so yeah which hopefully will be exciting

110
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
that's the first working group last call

111
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,319
in this working group

112
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,319
alright

113
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
with that i would like to start on this

114
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,440
on the main body of the discussion but

115
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,599
it's kind of going to be a bit hard if

116
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
john clenson is not here

117
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,159
so let's just give him a few minutes

118
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,440
i hope he is not right uh you know

119
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,280
running windows and it didn't decide to

120
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,039
update to windows 11 or something which

121
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,599
will take a few

122
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,879
hours um

123
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,719
hmm

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
so i'm actually so uh john levine is

125
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
volunteering to discuss his issues i'm

126
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,839
tempted to do the other way maybe we

127
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
should start from the end of the

128
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,839
slide deck and talk about

129
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,720
enhanced status codes

130
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,560
okay

131
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,839
right

132
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,640
ken

133
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,760
sorry i

134
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,959
i'm trying to um

135
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
yes reorganize agenda a little bit while

136
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,399
we're waiting for john so let's let's

137
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,360
start with your topic

138
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,880
so um

139
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
i read the uh the thread in the mailing

140
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,200
list uh two or three times

141
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,040
and uh the summary there is what

142
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,640
i boiled

143
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,480
boiled the issues down to at least my

144
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,760
understanding of it

145
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,279
and came up with this the following

146
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,120
suggested text

147
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,200
i don't think it's worth my while to

148
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,760
read it you can also i'll read it and if

149
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
there's any objections to that i am more

150
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,120
than willing to

151
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,880
accept some

152
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,839
uh some text

153
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
okay do you want to just give a very

154
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
quick sorry i'm just a

155
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
quick background so the originally your

156
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,279
document was saying

157
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,519
must support enhanced status codes and

158
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,560
then

159
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,519
um

160
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,360
some sort of implementation said what

161
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,800
does it mean

162
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,839
uh

163
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,880
for us and yeah so yeah there was a bit

164
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
of pushback from some implementations

165
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,360
yeah in the original text actually said

166
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,240
you must implement the the spec that was

167
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,160
actually the original registry for the

168
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,560
code so that was that was confusing so

169
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,040
uh this actually says you uh it's

170
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
recommended to

171
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,079
implement the

172
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,640
enhanced status code extension

173
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,519
to smtp and then also refers to the list

174
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,399
of codes in the registry

175
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,160
uh

176
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,880
any comments

177
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,880
i mean obviously we still need to double

178
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,959
check this on the mailing list but i

179
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,519
think that's kind of uh

180
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,440
would be nice to see if people think

181
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,160
we're going in the right direction

182
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,320
okay

183
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,160
sounds good to me

184
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,160
so john john clanson you're back

185
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,399
hope uh all right so let's get back to

186
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
our regional

187
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,680
right

188
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,279
okay

189
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,279
starting from the beginning of

190
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,639
list of issues uh we have an old ticket

191
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,040
11.

192
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,959
talking about possible clarification

193
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,360
about mail transactions and

194
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,240
transaction state

195
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,959
so john's original note was that section

196
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,639
33 should be

197
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,200
would be improved if it be more specific

198
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
about when mail transaction begins and

199
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,560
ends

200
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,880
um and what's part of the transaction um

201
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,120
there was some updates to the document

202
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
since the original issue was raised i

203
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,000
had a look at the text in this section

204
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,200
and i quoted the first paragraph of it

205
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,079
which

206
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,240
i think talks exactly about what john

207
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
was asking about

208
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
so it says me on transaction starts with

209
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,680
mail command

210
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,200
um

211
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,760
followed by one or more rcpt2 uh etc and

212
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,639
finished by data um there is a follow-up

213
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
uh paragraph also talking about quit and

214
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,199
our set

215
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,279
so

216
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,079
my suggestion is

217
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,120
it looks like this ticket is closed

218
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,120
john

219
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
uh i hope you can hear me

220
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,680
yes

221
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,839
uh i i as as i've looked at this more uh

222
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,560
i i agree with you no no change is

223
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,519
needed

224
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,720
i think a small editorial twitch

225
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,639
uh would probably improve things

226
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,760
slightly

227
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,279
and uh and propose the insertion of uh

228
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,760
uh of the word normal in that first

229
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,880
sentence

230
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,240
uh before smtpm mail transactions

231
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,680
as a slight improvement but uh

232
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
this is uh

233
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,639
um

234
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
not worth a lot of time

235
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,360
okay sounds good to me uh if you can

236
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,320
propose

237
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,880
[Music]

238
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,800
can you write the proper proposal where

239
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,880
to insert the word on the mailing list

240
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,920
uh i from my standpoint i could i

241
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,639
consider that a small editorial tweak

242
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,079
for which we do not need to have a

243
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,040
discussion but it's up to you

244
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,240
that's fine i'm okay with that

245
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,160
all right so uh tentatively

246
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,320
i will post a message tentatively this

247
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
is closed

248
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,839
subject to my editorial tweak which

249
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
we'll see in next revision

250
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,760
okay

251
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,240
um now another um

252
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,120
ticket that uh

253
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,399
rose out of our discussion at itf 112

254
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,000
was

255
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,079
iron registration policy for smtp

256
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,079
extensions

257
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,040
basically

258
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,440
the current document says as

259
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,560
rfc 5321 that it's a standard strike an

260
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,680
experimental rfc approved by sg

261
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,160
we have removed

262
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
um

263
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,000
x-extensions so they are not prohibited

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
from being registered now and i think it

265
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,759
will be a good idea to register some of

266
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,000
them which raise the question whether

267
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,959
our iron registration policy is correct

268
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,440
so um

269
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,480
roughly uh on the following slide there

270
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,199
are

271
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,199
two proposals one is specification

272
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,639
required

273
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,880
which is as a quick reminder this is

274
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,399
expert review

275
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,000
plus specification which can be rfc it

276
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,880
doesn't have to be ietf stream rfc

277
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,920
um alternative proposal is first come

278
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,519
first serve

279
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,440
with registration templates requiring

280
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,040
specification

281
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,759
so

282
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,519
i'll show the next flight

283
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,240
slide with the

284
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,519
proposal and we had some discussion on

285
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,519
the mailing list i think

286
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,680
we'll have more discussion now about

287
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,479
alternatives

288
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,120
so

289
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,400
yes let's have a discussion

290
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,559
okay

291
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,319
john do you want to say the first word

292
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,319
yeah

293
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,119
i don't know how many of you have

294
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,880
managed to see the notes i sent to the

295
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,839
list uh not too many hours ago

296
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,799
um but uh i'm a little

297
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,960
a little concerned about clutter here

298
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,679
and uh and vanity activities

299
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,919
and yeah we've got some dead ones but

300
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,600
the dead ones seem to be reasonable at

301
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,880
the time

302
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,160
um i'm uh so what i'm i'm sort of

303
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,480
feeling for and and i'm also concerned

304
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,600
about

305
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
the possibility of getting a an

306
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,720
extension proposal in conjunction with

307
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
some special application that the uh

308
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,039
that the expert reviewers don't

309
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
necessarily understand

310
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,120
um so

311
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
i've been feeling around and the

312
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
comments on the list summarize some of

313
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,000
it and i've had some separate

314
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,760
conversations with murray

315
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
uh about the uh

316
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,320
the possibility of uh

317
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,200
of creating a sort of in between here

318
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,160
where we uh where we don't quite require

319
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,919
the level of

320
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,559
of approval the current text does

321
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,600
uh but we still do it a community last

322
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,640
call

323
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,400
in which uh

324
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,799
uh which which gives people who may have

325
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,640
expertise that the

326
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
experts don't and this mailing and this

327
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,880
mailing list doesn't

328
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,679
uh to uh to chime in on the thing if

329
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,400
they see something that others don't

330
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,600
um

331
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,840
uh it's a much lower bar than requiring

332
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,440
standards track

333
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,240
but it's a little bit more than uh

334
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,679
um

335
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,480
than

336
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,799
allowing the my pet rock uh extension

337
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,320
so i think it's sort of like

338
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,000
specification required with extra uh

339
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,320
itf list last call

340
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,720
uh that's one way of looking at it

341
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,600
okay

342
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,918
um

343
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,679
murray

344
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,320
um yeah i i we did talk about that and i

345
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,280
i think

346
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,200
that or what you have described here as

347
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,559
new one are both palatable um we

348
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,760
recently

349
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,440
had a document come through that looked

350
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,280
more like new to where it's first come

351
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,960
first serve but there's some provisions

352
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,600
around that and vcp 26 doesn't really

353
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,240
support the i like it says that ayanna

354
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
will basically accept anything that's

355
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
well formed if you say first come first

356
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,960
serve

357
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
asking them to make a judgment about

358
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,320
whether the reference

359
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,080
describes a particular thing or looks a

360
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,160
particular way is outside of ayanna's

361
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,760
remit so i think new too might be a

362
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
harder sell

363
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,880
yeah i tend to agree um

364
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,360
very

365
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,480
can i

366
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,720
volunteer you to try to defend

367
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,440
sorry i i sort of got very not

368
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,320
yeah so i i wrote this this thing here

369
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
the i'm okay with either of these

370
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,240
options specification required or

371
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,720
first come first served with a reference

372
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,760
the reason that i proposed maybe we

373
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,600
should do the second one

374
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
is that i wanted to really stress that

375
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,760
that we would rather have these

376
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,320
registered than make the bar high to get

377
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,880
the registration specification required

378
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,440
ought to be a very easy level

379
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
but changing to that requires that we

380
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,600
appoint an expert for this and go

381
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,200
through that process

382
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,440
when really we'd just rather have people

383
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,000
register everything that they're using

384
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but we do want some sort of reference to

385
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,960
say what what it means

386
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
so i'm okay with either one we pick we

387
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,000
just need to have the discussion about

388
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,240
which way we want to go okay murray do

389
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,559
you mind if i insert myself before you

390
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,919
no go ahead

391
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,360
um

392
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,080
my counter argument as a participant you

393
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,320
know i i kind of i will be okay either

394
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,480
way um is um

395
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,120
as murray pointed out earlier that ayan

396
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,840
is not going to check names so if i

397
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,880
start if i request an extension called

398
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,280
my shiny balloon it would be very hard

399
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
to refuse and say no pick a better name

400
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,919
or something um

401
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,760
so um

402
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,440
but i i guess my point is that if

403
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
somebody wants to use one called my

404
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,640
shiny balloon why should we tell them

405
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,760
not to who cares

406
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,520
um i i i

407
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,760
i think the way to resolve that is the

408
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,280
the clause you have here that says that

409
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,960
describes the extension's purpose format

410
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
and usage if you drop that i think we're

411
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,120
good

412
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,880
all right because because you're not

413
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,960
asking diana to confirm what's in this

414
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,360
what's in the reference well no

415
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,240
okay

416
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,039
the

417
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,799
this text is for the person who's going

418
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,720
to do the registration all we're going

419
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,280
to ask guyana to do is make sure that

420
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,799
there's a reference and that it doesn't

421
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,799
say chicken chicken chicken chicken and

422
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,280
beyond that ayanna's not going to do any

423
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,520
checking but i want the

424
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,360
person making the registration request

425
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,520
to know what we expect to have in the

426
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,240
reference as kind of a guideline okay

427
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,200
yeah that's i think that'll fly yeah

428
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,039
and and if we decide to go with

429
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,880
specification required i'm happy to

430
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,799
volunteer as the designated expert who

431
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,600
will basically approve everything

432
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,720
so

433
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,960
john

434
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,720
i i'm

435
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,520
i'm pushing back a little bit on

436
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,159
and i don't overburden overburden diana

437
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,000
i think we're agreed about that and i

438
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
think we're agreed about the principle

439
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
that it's better to have registrations

440
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,840
than to

441
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,120
have things floating around which aren't

442
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,559
unregistered

443
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,679
uh

444
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,120
i'm

445
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,919
i'm concerned that over the years we've

446
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:56,880
seen

447
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,360
attempts to extend things here done in

448
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,039
various ways

449
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,960
that are loony

450
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,640
and i'd like to be able to get enough

451
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,200
community input into the process to help

452
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,960
the authors understand where things are

453
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,880
loony or where things won't work

454
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,480
i don't want to create a bar to

455
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,799
registration in the sense the standards

456
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,159
track thing does

457
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,200
but i want to create the opportunity for

458
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,000
input and discussion and entire at a

459
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,080
more extensive level than the authors

460
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,760
talking themselves

461
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,080
or the reviewers

462
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,679
um

463
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,320
uh having to review something that they

464
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,400
may not understand even for whether or

465
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,919
not there's a specification that makes

466
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,159
sense

467
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,000
fair enough

468
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,279
you know

469
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,360
okay uh

470
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,279
john levine do you want to comment on

471
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,799
this you commented on the mailing list i

472
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,520
just trying to

473
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,880
get a bit more discussion

474
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,679
yeah um

475
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,760
i think i'm aligned with barry here i

476
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,520
mean i understand

477
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,679
sort of that in principle there is a

478
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,600
writ you know there's a risk that people

479
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,720
might want to

480
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,880
sneak horrible stuff through here but

481
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,320
given that we're not the network police

482
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,440
if they want to do horrible stuff

483
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,960
they'll do it anyway so i would presume

484
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,559
i would presume to be documented

485
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,120
yeah again if if we could figure out a

486
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,880
way to write first come first serve

487
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,120
after an ietf last call

488
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,000
uh

489
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,640
i i i'd be happy about that

490
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,240
uh it's something we've certainly never

491
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,679
done before

492
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,400
uh but uh but i do want to

493
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,240
give people who are proposing these

494
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,880
things the opportunity for uh

495
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,120
uh for community input

496
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,559
um

497
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,840
so my sense of

498
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,520
uh john clenson

499
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,360
my sense of what you want you want is

500
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,279
you you you don't want to block them

501
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,000
from registering you don't want to say

502
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,080
uh you need to prove to us that this is

503
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,159
useful you just want to have them have

504
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,640
the opportunity to have an exchange and

505
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,000
get helped if they need it

506
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,840
more

507
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,159
more or less barry and uh

508
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,279
and the only qualification is that uh

509
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,559
that i'm inclined to try to require that

510
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,400
because as we both know from other

511
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,720
contexts the people who most need that

512
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,320
help usually don't understand they need

513
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,120
it

514
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,039
right yeah exactly

515
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,520
yeah i have sympathy for that and i i

516
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,200
need to respond to the note that you

517
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,039
sent to a few of us

518
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,200
about that kind of how we could come up

519
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,799
with a new

520
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,799
kind of registration process that would

521
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,799
help with that so we can talk about that

522
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,200
another time but uh yeah i have sympathy

523
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,360
for that

524
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,320
pete

525
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,120
do you have an opinion you

526
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,200
sorry i'm i'm i'm trying to

527
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
track everybody he's got his shoulders

528
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,918
hunched over

529
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,039
pete resnick i'll repeat what i just

530
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,360
said in the chat room um i have a

531
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,919
leaning toward make this as close to

532
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,240
first come first served as we can

533
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,279
do it and i like the idea of

534
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,880
some sort of documentation that gives

535
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,640
people the ability to

536
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,679
you know

537
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,360
get some advice from the community if

538
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,200
they want it but

539
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,159
really that you know this is not a

540
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,960
closed name space at all and

541
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,120
you know if people like shiny balloon as

542
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,320
their

543
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,159
you know as

544
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
what they want to register that's not

545
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,320
going to do any damage to the protocol

546
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,559
so

547
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
i have a friendly proposal to my first

548
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,840
friendly proposal

549
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,159
um maybe what we want to say here then

550
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,320
is first come first served with the

551
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,919
reference must also be provided

552
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,320
describes this and say it is highly

553
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,600
recommended

554
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,720
that

555
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,120
registrants post to this mailing list

556
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
and get feedback before they proceed

557
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,120
with their registration something there

558
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,880
that will encourage them to ask for

559
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,400
feedback

560
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,799
but still allow them to just do a fast

561
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,640
track registration if that's really what

562
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,799
they want to do what do you think john

563
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,279
clenson

564
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,799
i could probably live with that

565
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,039
i do

566
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,760
i do think the implication i i'm still

567
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
hearing marshall's voice which is in the

568
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,090
text

569
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,360
[Laughter]

570
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,960
and uh

571
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,600
and the uh

572
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,760
the implication of needing to fast-track

573
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,039
one of these

574
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,399
because somebody has come up with a

575
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,919
brilliant idea they want to get in the

576
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,240
ayanna registry right away

577
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,320
uh is

578
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,600
uh is an invitation to having to revise

579
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,440
it later for which we have no procedure

580
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,799
at all right uh and uh uh and generally

581
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,480
creating a mess if anybody pays any

582
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,720
attention to registration

583
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,120
again i don't want to do anything which

584
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,159
will

585
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,880
discourage people from registering

586
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
but i do want to try to find some way to

587
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,159
encourage people to think about what

588
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,360
they're doing

589
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,399
and uh and and we have all seen over the

590
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,279
years in ietf people come up with

591
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,159
brilliant ideas at least in their minds

592
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,600
which are so important that they should

593
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,840
be deployed immediately many of which

594
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,919
are described as ipv10

595
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,919
but

596
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,000
there's a trade-off there yeah or or you

597
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,320
are in uris that don't have colons in

598
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,000
them or whatever so yeah precisely yes

599
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and and and we have proved that this has

600
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,480
happened multiple times

601
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
all right

602
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,360
get ready pete uh yeah the speed again

603
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,799
um

604
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,159
i i think i just want to address the um

605
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,240
fast track i don't think that's the

606
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,919
reason that i lean toward first come

607
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,279
first serve it's pain in the ass

608
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,240
right

609
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,360
it's

610
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,679
we want people who

611
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,799
have something to register to not think

612
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,520
oh my what a pain in the ass let's just

613
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,760
skip the registration and start using it

614
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,600
which i think is what happens now

615
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,760
i don't think people really want you

616
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,080
know it needs to be registered today i

617
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,600
don't i think that's a very rare

618
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,600
instance i think the real problem is

619
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,320
that people view it as a hurdle

620
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,200
and so we want to say there's no hurdle

621
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,760
you just register them but please

622
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,200
announce them here

623
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,880
and you know get some feedback

624
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,840
okay um again as a

625
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,039
participant uh i'm sort of in between

626
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,320
varying pete and john

627
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,240
i think i would prefer

628
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,120
for registration requests to be posted

629
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,720
mandatorily

630
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,799
to the mailing list

631
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,480
but feedback yeah to

632
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,960
but then have first come first serve

633
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,200
after the you know two weeks period this

634
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,080
uh

635
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,679
kind of quite similar to what we're

636
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,960
doing with some media types

637
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,279
um

638
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,960
so you know in other words so you're

639
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,880
okay with the idea that somebody posts

640
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,399
to this mailing list

641
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,720
gets feedback saying your idea is really

642
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,080
really bad

643
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,960
rethink it please and they say

644
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
and register it anyway without paying

645
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,399
attention to feedback

646
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,200
that's that's my preference

647
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,480
because i'd rather see it read if

648
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,679
they're going to use it i'd rather see

649
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,240
it registered than not

650
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,960
but that covers john's concern that they

651
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,880
need a way to get feedback

652
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,279
i think

653
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,279
i can live with this

654
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,679
basically

655
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,320
i would prefer that people engage in the

656
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,240
discussion but if they say well that's

657
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,320
just a thing that

658
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,200
i just need to send one email and

659
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,840
never have to read any responses well

660
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,720
as you guys said we're not police

661
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,159
the the the

662
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,200
the

663
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
my my other concern here it goes

664
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,039
directly to the question dave asked in

665
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,799
the chat is that we end up with a

666
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,919
um

667
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,480
with a registration of something which

668
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,919
seems to have something which looks like

669
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,519
a specification

670
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,960
and then they discover it doesn't work

671
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
and the specification changes they don't

672
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,519
bother

673
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,880
it or

674
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,960
adopt a registration document because

675
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,039
that too is a pain in the ass

676
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,840
and i don't know that can be prevented

677
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,480
but again if the community gets a chance

678
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,200
to discuss the thing it may be possible

679
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,720
to uh

680
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,559
um

681
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,559
to get the thing

682
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,679
uh

683
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,120
uh improved a little bit if uh if

684
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,039
possible before the registration goes in

685
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,880
and anybody tries to use it

686
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,799
and i'm not trying to set a bar here i'm

687
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,279
trying to provide an opportunity for for

688
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,640
discussion

689
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,480
uh if we take that much out

690
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,799
uh the other question for the working

691
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,960
group is whether i should simply remove

692
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,000
the text which argues for minimizing

693
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,159
extensions because they

694
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,080
cause it because they inherently cause

695
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,360
interoperability problems

696
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,760
okay ken

697
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,600
hi ken richardson um

698
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,360
i think the the

699
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
bigger issue that we want to try to

700
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
solve here is

701
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,840
not having two different vendors

702
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,320
start using a keyword

703
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,000
at the same time without either one of

704
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,039
them registering and then there's

705
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,399
eventually name clash i think that's

706
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,559
more important than somebody registering

707
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,240
a an extension that ends up being

708
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,679
technical garbage

709
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,360
because as pete said before

710
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,559
no one's going to use it there's no

711
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,480
interoperability problem

712
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,000
but if vendor a starts using fubar and

713
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,919
vendor b starts using fubar and they did

714
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,120
two different things then we've got a

715
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,439
problem

716
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,399
dave

717
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,840
good morning um it's 4 30 here even

718
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,480
though i'm some distance from murray

719
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,720
um

720
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,840
the last comment goes to what i think is

721
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,360
the only operational problem

722
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,279
that has a serious effect

723
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,279
um the

724
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,320
the

725
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
general problems of posting stuff that's

726
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,240
crap

727
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,960
um is their problem it it

728
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
the name space will get a little noisier

729
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,159
but it doesn't actually matter

730
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,919
and

731
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,720
the

732
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
some of the discussion has sounded like

733
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,360
it's trying to create additional iana

734
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,799
policies

735
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,279
and my guess is that's not actually

736
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,760
what's being intended but rather

737
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,640
the intention is to use an existing iana

738
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,760
policy but add various uh items of

739
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,360
advice

740
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,039
to this document

741
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,480
and uh

742
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,720
well that wasn't actually clear from the

743
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,480
discussion and

744
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,520
um

745
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,239
putting in various commentary

746
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,359
uh

747
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,239
might seem like a good idea

748
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,399
uh but the more

749
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,960
detailed that commentary is the more

750
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,599
opportunity since this will be new text

751
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,159
the more opportunity there is for it to

752
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,760
be confusing

753
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,800
uh and and as an example of that i'll

754
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,918
point out that i was confused listening

755
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,639
to this if i was confused listening to

756
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,079
this what are the odds of somebody

757
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,399
reading this in a document is going to

758
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,320
think that this is a requirement rather

759
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
than advice

760
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,960
so i might suggest my suggestion is

761
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,480
minimize the changes address only the

762
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,119
the problem that is on the table which

763
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,599
is getting people to register and don't

764
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,079
try to quality control the registration

765
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,200
process

766
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,119
uh or or

767
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,440
because if they want it to be used they

768
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,680
will come and get advice

769
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,640
if they are convinced in their arrogance

770
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,800
that they know truth

771
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,680
they're just going to work around this

772
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,880
don't add more text that is basically

773
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,400
parental

774
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,079
even if it's good parenting

775
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,119
all right so uh

776
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,079
my feeling of the room is that we're

777
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,079
leaning somewhere toward first come

778
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,320
first serve

779
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,599
with

780
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,839
some kind

781
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,560
of suggestion about mailing lists

782
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,480
posting to the mailing list

783
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,280
yeah

784
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,000
and

785
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
i hear dave's comment i i i unders i

786
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,160
have sympathy for that too so

787
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,119
maybe what we want to do is introduce

788
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,599
apart from this text somewhere else from

789
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,800
this text

790
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,640
that there is a mailing list to discuss

791
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,520
extensions and it's useful and put that

792
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,160
somewhere else that's not right here

793
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,880
so people don't think it's a requirement

794
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,720
but it's a place they can get feedback

795
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,880
i i don't know

796
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
i'm designing on the

797
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,000
on the microphone right now

798
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,599
uh

799
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,320
you added yourself and you took

800
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,560
john

801
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,599
yeah i'll i'll i'll repeat what i said

802
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,000
in the uh in the chat

803
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,800
which is that if what we really need

804
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,240
if the issue is making certain that

805
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,160
people can register these things

806
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,320
absolutely painlessly

807
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,839
uh one

808
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,960
one additional possibility is to

809
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,200
allow immediate registration on request

810
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,880
which is very much like first come first

811
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,920
serve

812
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,280
um

813
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,640
and uh

814
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,960
and then give and then post something to

815
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,640
the lit to a list

816
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,200
and give the authors uh

817
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,240
um

818
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,880
60 days to listen to whatever comments

819
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,119
transpire and at the end of those 60

820
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,720
days registration becomes permanent

821
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,720
that's actually not a bad idea i think

822
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,319
yeah i could certainly live with that

823
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,240
dave does that

824
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,680
address your concern or does it um fall

825
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,319
into parenting

826
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
that sounds like it's trying to create

827
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,480
revised iana procedures

828
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,280
it it it doesn't date because after a

829
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,760
careful look at the ayanna procedures

830
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
and barry can comment more on this that

831
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,440
i can because he wrote them uh but uh

832
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,560
but the iana procedures require

833
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,000
do not require that any of those

834
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,400
standard categories be used it requires

835
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,560
only that the procedure be clear to

836
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,160
ayanna

837
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
right that's correct and there are in

838
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,040
fact some pretty bizarre

839
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,280
twistings of these that people have used

840
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,440
in various areas

841
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,760
and they work really

842
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,240
sorry right and they're a mess sorry

843
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,640
so so

844
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,560
as you try to create conditions you

845
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,960
create opportunity for confusions this

846
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,000
is the problem with new specification

847
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,760
i thought the goal of the working group

848
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,280
was to make minimal changes not merely

849
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,200
make whatever changes seem like a good

850
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,680
idea

851
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,400
but dave this

852
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,760
making any change here is is a change

853
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,119
and uh

854
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,520
and a change which

855
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,400
preserves some of the current properties

856
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,880
of what the document says

857
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,920
uh while loosening the requirements

858
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,800
is a minimal change and it's no less a

859
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,160
minimal change

860
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,079
than uh then

861
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,560
or no more or less than a of a minimal

862
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
change than saying well check it all and

863
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,599
go to first first serve

864
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,640
going to first come first serve invokes

865
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,480
an established process that is

866
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,280
reasonably well understood the downsides

867
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,200
of doing that are also fairly well

868
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,839
understood as soon as we start adding

869
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,520
more conditions

870
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,400
we're creating a new specification with

871
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,640
more opportunity for misunderstanding

872
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,560
and miss action

873
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,520
but but but if we do what i suggested

874
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,200
more or less

875
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,440
the only

876
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,160
complication

877
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,800
is whether ayanna can make a mark on

878
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,200
their calendar and count to 60

879
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,040
or some other period which somebody

880
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,160
picks

881
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,760
and

882
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,240
per the diana specification document

883
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,000
again barry can say more about this than

884
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,079
i can if iana doesn't think they can

885
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,359
count to 60 reliably then they say no

886
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,119
that doesn't work

887
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,119
so no i i think what john is saying

888
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,440
there is in fact a cue and i understand

889
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,359
we're doing a little colloquy here but i

890
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,119
would like at least the chance to step

891
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,880
in my ears

892
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,280
i'm sorry

893
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,560
the the mask

894
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,359
right pete then barry

895
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,400
this is pete i i want to um

896
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,520
actually

897
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,000
disagree with john on this um

898
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,680
the

899
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,319
the simplest way to deal with this

900
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,480
is do first come first serve

901
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,280
and if we want some sort of iana

902
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
instructions in the iana considerations

903
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,800
that they announce it somewhere that's

904
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,920
fine putting a 60-day delay is exactly

905
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,960
the kind of fence that is going to cause

906
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,760
people to not register these things and

907
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,440
i think the amount of damage they can

908
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,920
possibly do is so minimal

909
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,880
that it should not be done

910
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
we should just simply do it first come

911
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,800
first serve if we want to give ayanna

912
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,640
instruction that they should announce

913
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
this such that we can interact with the

914
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,319
person because they're going to provide

915
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,480
an email address anyway and we can cc

916
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,079
them on this

917
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,880
that's fine that's certainly

918
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,720
not changing

919
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,680
the

920
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,079
registration policy it changes an iana

921
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,760
procedure but it's basically an

922
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,119
announcement

923
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,880
um so i i i think we're asking for

924
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,319
trouble

925
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,319
if we're going to go away from

926
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,319
specification required and not require

927
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,720
expert review if that's the decision

928
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,160
we're making then let's just go to first

929
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,680
come first served and make an

930
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,160
announcement

931
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,319
okay there's actually something new in

932
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,640
what pete said that i'll follow up in a

933
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,640
second but what i wanted to say first

934
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,839
was i think john what i

935
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,480
john is

936
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
is looking for something

937
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,720
yes john is john is trying to propose

938
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,960
something that is very different

939
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,400
and what pete said that um that keyed

940
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,760
there is

941
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,480
if we instead of trying to put this on

942
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,599
the registrant we put it on iana we ask

943
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,400
them

944
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,319
to post to the

945
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,960
discussion list

946
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,520
i think that helps i think that makes

947
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,800
that takes the

948
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
load away from the registrant

949
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,720
i have to agree with dave on this that

950
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,480
um

951
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,680
there is no need to change this text at

952
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,720
all

953
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,280
we can leave this as standards track or

954
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,040
experimental rfc specifically approved

955
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,680
by the isg for this purpose

956
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,520
and we did say we're going to make

957
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,760
minimal changes so that is the minimal

958
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,400
change is not to change it at all

959
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,640
the next minimal change is to say well

960
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,680
but this is really is ietf review is

961
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,520
really what this means so let's change

962
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,800
it to that

963
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,280
even making its specification required

964
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,160
is more than a minimal change

965
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,839
and making it first come first serve

966
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,680
with this and that tweak

967
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,720
is a bigger change so it depends how we

968
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,078
want to go with changes

969
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,119
i i am fairly ambivalent on it at this

970
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,119
point

971
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,319
okay

972
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,480
i'm going to lock the door in this room

973
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,240
and nobody leaves until i make a

974
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,879
decision

975
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,040
remote people have a slight advantage

976
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,440
here they just just run

977
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,680
um

978
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
i think the path of least resistance is

979
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,880
to to go with specification required and

980
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,240
have the

981
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,160
have somebody review it

982
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,839
but it doesn't have to be the ietf

983
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,560
reviewing it

984
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,800
works for me personally

985
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,400
this is pete

986
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,160
my only concern about specification

987
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,079
required is i don't think it

988
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,240
significantly changes

989
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,280
the barrier that the current text has

990
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,680
such that we're gonna solve the problem

991
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,839
no it does actually i understand the

992
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,440
difference between the two

993
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,240
but

994
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,400
i i suspect that anybody who is

995
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,720
unwilling to even do an experimental rfc

996
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,599
just submit the draft is not going to do

997
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,079
specification required

998
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,160
yeah but specification required can be

999
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,720
you post something to your blog

1000
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,760
right

1001
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,240
this is a go doing an rfc even if it's

1002
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,480
through the independent stream is

1003
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,880
more of a burden

1004
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,400
dave

1005
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,119
so in response to barry my question is

1006
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,280
so what

1007
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,920
so what on which

1008
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,640
you you were you were laying out a

1009
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,240
possibility

1010
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,720
of uh some um

1011
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,800
let's call it casual

1012
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,040
uh uh behavior

1013
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,720
which might have some uh uh challenges

1014
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,440
in utility so posting to a blog might or

1015
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,079
might not actually uh be useful

1016
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,400
um and so they register a name and they

1017
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,160
only post to a blog

1018
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,440
um

1019
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,200
and gee that's that doesn't work very

1020
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,040
well let's let's just take that case

1021
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,200
which is just what i assume

1022
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,000
uh why you mentioned that as an example

1023
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,800
and to which my response is so what

1024
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,680
their

1025
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,440
their option

1026
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,520
perhaps isn't useful

1027
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,760
so what yeah that basically what i was

1028
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,240
saying i'm agreeing with you there yeah

1029
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,920
no what i was saying is that as opposed

1030
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,520
to having to do an rfc which is what

1031
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,280
they have to do now

1032
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,240
which which is

1033
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,560
oh okay i thought you were raising it as

1034
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,359
a worst case an example of a worst case

1035
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,920
scenario

1036
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,880
so specification required

1037
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,119
is an entirely reasonable barrier but

1038
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,520
it's a very high barrier if we're trying

1039
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,720
to lower the barrier

1040
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,960
then get rid of the damn barrier

1041
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,480
and that's why i proposed first come

1042
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,280
first serve yeah right

1043
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,880
sorry i i

1044
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,079
yeah okay

1045
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,520
and i'm just pointing out though that

1046
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,599
first come first served is a significant

1047
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,520
change and if we're really looking to

1048
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,359
make minimal changes to the document we

1049
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,960
have to consider that so i i

1050
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,680
hansjorg

1051
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,680
who was patiently listening to our

1052
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,879
bickering all this time

1053
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,119
uh yeah hi this isn't

1054
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,480
indeed i might probably have a little

1055
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,200
bit of an unpopular opinion here so um i

1056
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,079
was wondering for myself uh

1057
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,760
for quite some time actually with any

1058
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,000
ayanna registry that's

1059
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,839
i'm not really sure if this is a core

1060
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,560
part people use a lot actually and

1061
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,960
you know i'm they do yeah they do i'm

1062
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,960
wondering actually i mean i i i totally

1063
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,560
understand why this discussion sort of

1064
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,319
is necessary however i'm wondering a

1065
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,680
little bit like we are discussing here

1066
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,839
something for quite some time now

1067
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,720
um which actually is probably not even

1068
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,960
as such a big deal because just not so

1069
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,800
many people will actually ever register

1070
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,400
something here i mean one could argue

1071
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,920
because currently these policies are too

1072
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,359
strict but i'm actually sure that's not

1073
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,640
the point

1074
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,240
the discussion in my opinion rather

1075
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,480
should be on a much more meter level

1076
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,160
maybe like you know

1077
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,160
how in general could could ayanna

1078
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,040
registries made more useful for

1079
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,680
users of the services and doesn't that

1080
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,000
kind of stuff need redesign overall i

1081
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,520
know that it's probably too big of a

1082
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,040
topic yeah right now it's probably out

1083
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,040
of scope that's why i said it's an

1084
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,760
unpopular opinion maybe well so so i

1085
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,480
guess the point here is um and i have no

1086
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,480
data and so i'm just

1087
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,800
sort of groping but

1088
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,640
it may be that that people who have

1089
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,720
cockamamie ideas that are

1090
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,119
not really useful

1091
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,599
are deterred from putting them into

1092
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,280
their stuff by

1093
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,040
having to do an rfc

1094
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,200
and they can't do an rfc because we're

1095
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,800
never going to do it we're never going

1096
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,000
to approve an rfc that has this bad idea

1097
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
and so they don't bother at all and they

1098
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,119
just don't come with it and if we made

1099
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,880
it easy

1100
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,480
they would come with it and put in a lot

1101
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,400
of stupid ideas

1102
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,440
i i doubt that that's going to happen

1103
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,520
i'm not really expecting that if we just

1104
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,119
said first come first serve with no

1105
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,359
restriction i'm sure we're not going to

1106
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,400
suddenly get 300 requests for bad ideas

1107
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,200
as smtp extensions

1108
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,400
but maybe john has some data to refute

1109
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,839
that or dave's next in the queue

1110
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,839
actually

1111
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,000
dave

1112
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,000
sorry i was distracted being too clever

1113
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,440
responding to me ago so i didn't

1114
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,319
actually hear what you said

1115
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,800
you do you mean to be in the queue or

1116
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,000
oh sorry your hand is up no i i i i was

1117
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,319
i i thought that barry was asking me a

1118
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,079
question so i was trying to respond oh i

1119
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,079
just saw that i couldn't answer

1120
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,839
sorry

1121
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,400
right um

1122
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,359
i can think probably of four documents

1123
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,960
that will

1124
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,359
this will affect right away

1125
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,880
three of them or rx extensions in some

1126
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,480
common use

1127
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,839
published by sendmail and others uh

1128
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,160
one probably fall into the care of their

1129
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,480
bad idea category

1130
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,800
um

1131
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,839
i don't know if it helps us but

1132
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,880
so i i can see that uh both there are

1133
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,559
things that are not registered because

1134
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,040
of current registration procedure

1135
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,280
and i can also see some cases which

1136
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,040
might might not be registered depending

1137
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,800
on which bar you know which level we

1138
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,720
pick basically and i'm perfectly okay

1139
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
with seeing a few bad ideas come in and

1140
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,640
get registered but i wouldn't want

1141
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,520
hundreds john

1142
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,680
i'm uh

1143
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,559
i think we're spending far too much time

1144
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,359
on this discussion than it is worth

1145
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,240
relative the rest of the agenda and uh

1146
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,319
and we either take this the mailing list

1147
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,800
or drop it and uh and adopt the

1148
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,040
principle of minimal change which i of

1149
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,200
absolutely minimal change which i would

1150
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,599
oppose as well but um

1151
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,960
but i think we're going around the

1152
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,319
circles right now

1153
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,000
and the fact that i'm having trouble

1154
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,880
hearing

1155
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,200
speakers who are speaking almost next to

1156
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,839
micron into the mic uh doesn't help much

1157
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:46,880
but it's

1158
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,760
just

1159
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,359
an added aggravation we're spending too

1160
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,839
much time on this

1161
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,359
okay so yeah uh

1162
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,760
just doing a mic check is this mic any

1163
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,200
better for you to hear from john

1164
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,040
uh no

1165
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,680
okay that's the same and i i'm right now

1166
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,839
i'm right up against the mic so

1167
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,800
no no though as as i said it's uh it's

1168
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,680
about the same i uh i can hear you barry

1169
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,200
when you're speaking close to mikey

1170
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
clearly i've had trouble hearing other

1171
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,440
people who are a little more trouble

1172
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,200
hearing other people but it's still very

1173
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,720
faint

1174
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,800
okay

1175
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,599
right um

1176
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,160
buddy i will delegate you to follow up

1177
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,880
on the mailing list on this

1178
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,680
i will do that

1179
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,559
gosh you can just never predict which

1180
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,319
topic is going to be easy i thought this

1181
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,880
one will be easy one so

1182
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,720
you better help me out on the next one

1183
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,118
please

1184
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,800
oh by the way uh so john had technical

1185
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,520
problems so he was late so i talked

1186
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,760
about this already

1187
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,839
so yes

1188
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,480
thank you though um all right uh moving

1189
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,359
to the next one is one of the issues

1190
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:19,280
that john lewin raised was about verify

1191
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,680
being required command and observing

1192
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,040
that

1193
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,440
a lot of implementations either don't

1194
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,119
implement it or just have a stub

1195
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,680
implementation

1196
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,680
um

1197
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:39,839
so one thing that we sort of discovered

1198
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,960
while researching this um

1199
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,240
issue is that uh

1200
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,119
verify actually can be a capability and

1201
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,680
emitted by some mtas

1202
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,760
it is however not registered with ayana

1203
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,960
which probably should be fixed

1204
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,520
so basically the question is should

1205
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,520
should the document either say that

1206
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,640
verify

1207
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,720
may be implemented but doesn't does is

1208
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,240
not required

1209
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,520
or uh alternative we can just keep

1210
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,920
verifying the document and say if it's

1211
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,599
implemented then

1212
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,240
you have to emit verify verify

1213
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,959
capability

1214
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,240
thoughts comments

1215
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,599
john divine

1216
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,839
yep

1217
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,280
and the interest is minimal change

1218
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,119
i would you know i always say

1219
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,400
leave it in and say it's requested i

1220
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,839
mean just leave it in and require it

1221
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,240
since like i said

1222
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,359
if you don't actually if you don't want

1223
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:46,960
to actually provide a useful answer

1224
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,160
you're allowed you're allowed to do it

1225
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,879
to do a stub

1226
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,200
you know in my

1227
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,960
poking around it appears that in fact

1228
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,559
everybody does everybody does just do a

1229
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,200
252 so that would also match existing

1230
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,078
existing practice

1231
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,760
okay so uh

1232
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,000
right

1233
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,079
maybe there's a sentence saying about

1234
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,520
the stub implementation then or or is it

1235
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,440
right well i think

1236
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,440
you know it already allows this stuff um

1237
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,119
yeah i don't remember where the sentence

1238
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,119
allowing is the stub implementation is

1239
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,839
it may be okay already

1240
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,240
yeah i don't think the text quite allows

1241
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,359
the sub implementation

1242
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,599
there is uh certainly text saying that

1243
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,160
verify should should spend more energy

1244
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,960
trying to verify addresses than rcpt2

1245
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,480
does

1246
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,559
which kind of the opposite of

1247
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,960
what we are proposing

1248
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,040
i can't

1249
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,040
jon

1250
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,280
uh yeah just remember too that we've got

1251
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,240
enough loopholes in uh

1252
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,960
in five three two one even

1253
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,000
uh for uh for not doing things if they

1254
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,319
don't seem sensible or don't seem

1255
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,240
operationally reasonable or seem

1256
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,760
insecure

1257
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,880
that an

1258
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,200
implementation or configuration which

1259
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,400
doesn't feel like

1260
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,960
supporting verify simply leaves it on

1261
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,839
the hello list and moves

1262
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,160
on so one can not implement this while

1263
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,839
implementing it or something like that

1264
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
that's an argument for no change

1265
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,960
um yeah so maybe i think what we are

1266
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,200
it seems like it would be nice to add

1267
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,319
some text to as but maybe the base pack

1268
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,839
doesn't need to change

1269
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,520
is it roughly what i'm hearing

1270
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,960
or maybe not at all

1271
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,200
john would you like uh

1272
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,040
do you think we should have some text

1273
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,599
about verifying in is

1274
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,319
if we don't do a change to the base pack

1275
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:29,599
i

1276
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,799
i think if people want to we can clarify

1277
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,520
the existing rules a little bit

1278
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,920
because it's convoluted and

1279
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,000
different sections

1280
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,480
i believe after trying to review them

1281
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,760
say

1282
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,640
things but uh but it's very very easy to

1283
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,280
read them in ways which the uh in which

1284
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,839
what said it's not consistent or is he

1285
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:54,160
is even contradictory so that may be a

1286
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,119
little

1287
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,720
maybe a little straightening out but i

1288
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,240
don't think there's a strong case for

1289
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,119
making

1290
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,520
any substantive change here like trying

1291
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,480
to deprecate the thing

1292
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,319
okay

1293
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,000
pete was in the queue and he said what

1294
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,839
john

1295
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:15,359
said um todd

1296
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,359
yeah just to clarify the earlier bit

1297
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,160
about

1298
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,400
stop appearing in the spec or not

1299
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,200
the word stub doesn't but um in section

1300
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,960
seven three it speaks of

1301
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,640
if a site disables these commands for

1302
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,480
security reasons and one of the commands

1303
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,480
is verified the smtp server must return

1304
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,520
a 252 response so that kind of speaking

1305
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,880
toward the sub

1306
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,280
to the stub topic without actually using

1307
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,839
all right all right

1308
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,240
fine uh

1309
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,240
okay so i think what i'm hearing is or

1310
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,839
what i would like to propose is

1311
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,400
no change in the base pack uh

1312
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,359
if people want some extra explanation in

1313
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,440
as we can discuss this on the mailing

1314
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,760
list

1315
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,240
the separate minor issue about verified

1316
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,680
capability we can just take this

1317
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,960
directly to ion i think

1318
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,880
john

1319
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,040
do you want me to go through and see if

1320
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,880
i can see just

1321
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,359
clarification and editorial cleanups to

1322
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:38,480
this

1323
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,640
collection of statements about verifiers

1324
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,400
so we just let that go

1325
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,559
um i think it would be useful there

1326
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,000
might be like three sentences in

1327
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
different parts of the document that

1328
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
might look contradictory but maybe you

1329
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,040
just need to cross-reference saying

1330
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,119
this is what you know typically is done

1331
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,799
but look at x

1332
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:57,599
yeah

1333
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:58,480
okay

1334
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,480
i think that would be useful

1335
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,160
my guess is it'll be a few words here

1336
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,280
and there and maybe some cross

1337
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,960
references

1338
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,720
but but let me make a proposal on the

1339
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,400
mailing list

1340
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,270
okay sounds good

1341
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:13,329
[Music]

1342
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,319
right moving on

1343
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,839
uh john levine raised another um

1344
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,000
question about what is restricted

1345
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,839
capability client

1346
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,760
section three three

1347
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,000
restricted capability client must not

1348
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,799
assume that any smgp server on internet

1349
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,040
can be used as their mail processing

1350
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,720
relaying site

1351
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,959
um

1352
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,960
so uh i think it's it's a valid question

1353
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,400
what what is meant by the student

1354
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,720
capability client

1355
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,640
um

1356
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,799
also

1357
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,000
depending on what it means uh

1358
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,839
if this is talking about open relays

1359
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:02,559
not

1360
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,040
not being a good thing uh then maybe the

1361
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,000
text is misplaced and should be moved

1362
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,319
um

1363
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,359
john levine would you like to

1364
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,480
talk more about this one

1365
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,640
i think i would

1366
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,920
i didn't understand what restricted

1367
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,079
capability client meant

1368
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,200
and

1369
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,119
i just

1370
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,599
you know it like if it if it means it

1371
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,200
like the example i gave is my printer

1372
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,799
which sent which sends notifications to

1373
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,160
one address i mean if that's what we

1374
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,920
mean by a restricted capability client

1375
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,599
then the advice is fine and maybe we

1376
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,040
should define restricted capability

1377
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,040
client better i thought it might i

1378
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,480
thought it meant an mua that knows how

1379
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,839
to send mail to anybody but doesn't know

1380
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,920
how to it doesn't know how to find an mx

1381
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,440
in which case

1382
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,720
then it's

1383
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,640
the advice is kind of wrong

1384
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,079
so i guess

1385
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:55,200
yeah so yeah

1386
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,720
yeah my preference is just to be a

1387
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,079
little clearer about what we mean by a

1388
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,040
research capability client

1389
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,640
pete

1390
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,000
yeah um

1391
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,160
now that i read the sentence

1392
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,720
do we just mean clients

1393
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,880
i mean no client should assume that any

1394
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,880
smtp server on the internet can be used

1395
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,680
as their mail processing relaying site

1396
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,720
well i mean

1397
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,880
it's about open relays that then it's in

1398
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,520
the wrong section i i think that's what

1399
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,319
that

1400
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,000
is referring to

1401
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,319
i mean it it it's you know there you

1402
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:37,599
might not be able to get to an open

1403
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,839
relay you might not be able to

1404
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,280
have something that acts like a

1405
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,720
submission server

1406
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,119
um it you know

1407
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,119
not every smtp server on the internet

1408
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,599
can be used as a mail processing uh

1409
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:50,839
relay

1410
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:54,400
site uh unless someone thinks we meant

1411
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,559
something different there and and

1412
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,960
i mean maybe it should be moved but

1413
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,799
basically you're saying drop restricted

1414
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,559
capabilities yeah we're not saying

1415
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,319
anything magical there as far as i can

1416
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:08,319
tell i i'll go re-read the context but

1417
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,720
i think it's just clients

1418
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,959
john

1419
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,480
the the first observation

1420
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,240
is that uh

1421
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,720
uh as as the several exchanges between

1422
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,319
john levine and i

1423
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:27,680
um

1424
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,599
uh indicated

1425
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,079
prop probably indicate this this text is

1426
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,799
confusing and horrible and in my defense

1427
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:36,480
i didn't write it i was told to put it

1428
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,280
in

1429
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:37,720
um

1430
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,319
[Music]

1431
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,200
and we certainly need to clarify it

1432
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,240
one of the clarifications is that it was

1433
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,359
this

1434
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,359
sentence and a few others

1435
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,039
that caused me to raise the question as

1436
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,359
to whether we wanted to switch back to

1437
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,799
smtp sender rather than and smtp

1438
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:59,920
receiver rather than smtp client and

1439
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,640
smtp server

1440
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,839
because

1441
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,240
i think this texas intended to talk

1442
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,920
about smtp clients not muas

1443
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,640
and that immensely changes the meaning

1444
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,480
what's going on here although it still

1445
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,160
doesn't make it clear

1446
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,839
uh and uh and again the uh the note i

1447
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,520
sent to the we are the morning about

1448
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,400
this

1449
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,799
may at least clarify what the problem is

1450
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:29,680
if not what the solution is

1451
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,440
and i have no opinions today beyond that

1452
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,559
okay

1453
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,799
dave

1454
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,079
so as i posted there's sort of two

1455
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,000
different uh lines of thinking that can

1456
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,680
go with this text the first is

1457
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,720
do we know of existing operational

1458
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,520
problems being caused by this text i

1459
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,359
think the answer is no

1460
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:57,920
i think that the concern being concerns

1461
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,640
being raised are by the static reading

1462
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,880
of the text and thinking about it rather

1463
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,640
than having reports

1464
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,760
that argues against making any changes

1465
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,680
given the nature of the current working

1466
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,039
group effort

1467
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,480
that said

1468
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,480
there are problems with this text first

1469
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,319
of all the idea that software makes

1470
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,880
assumptions doesn't make any sense which

1471
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,440
invites confusion about this the second

1472
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,559
of all

1473
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,440
this actually is not text that is

1474
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,200
operational

1475
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,839
it isn't specifying it it isn't

1476
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,880
specifying a meaningful action

1477
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,400
or prohibiting

1478
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,799
it isn't meaningfully prohibiting

1479
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,599
an action that makes any sense

1480
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,680
and that argues for just dropping this

1481
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,160
text completely because we don't know we

1482
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,160
don't seem to know of what problem this

1483
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,359
is trying to

1484
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,359
the text is trying to solve we've just

1485
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,119
had several people make some guesses

1486
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,599
about it but we're not sure

1487
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,240
and so if the text is confusing which it

1488
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,839
clearly is

1489
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,079
dropping it in the absence of knowing

1490
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,480
what problems it's picking uh would

1491
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,640
would actually be the simplest thing to

1492
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,760
do

1493
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,160
leaving it given that we don't know of

1494
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,640
field problems it's causing is the other

1495
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,799
choice so dropping it or keeping it make

1496
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:16,880
the most sense changing it does not

1497
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:23,920
okay uh speaking as a participant i

1498
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,440
would be in favor of dropping it

1499
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,960
john

1500
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,480
i feel really strongly about this and i

1501
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,480
will drop it if people tell me to drop

1502
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,280
it

1503
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,200
but uh but i am reluctant to remove text

1504
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,559
that uh

1505
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:47,839
the drums

1506
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,839
the drums are yam i don't know which one

1507
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:53,280
at this point uh put in uh

1508
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,039
without

1509
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,799
without understanding what that was

1510
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,319
intended to say

1511
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,119
uh so i would argue for

1512
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,799
clarification in preference to dropping

1513
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:05,920
if we can figure out what that

1514
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,000
clarification means and i think

1515
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,760
clarifications are clearly in scope

1516
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,079
okay

1517
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,400
and i offered a hypothesis about what it

1518
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,720
means

1519
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,680
the um

1520
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,480
the text from 5321 we we've omitted one

1521
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,000
word from

1522
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,400
this sentence here that the sentence

1523
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,359
actually starts with the word

1524
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:34,160
consequently and it is

1525
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,720
contextually it is sort of talking about

1526
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,680
um

1527
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,280
open relays

1528
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,319
so

1529
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:41,839
that may

1530
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:43,599
inform any future direction we take on

1531
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,760
this text

1532
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,599
it doesn't just say restrict capability

1533
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,200
clients must not assume

1534
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,319
it says

1535
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:55,200
you know

1536
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,960
that the prior sentences these

1537
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,880
restrictions may make the server useless

1538
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,160
as a relay for clients that do not

1539
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,640
support full smtp functionality

1540
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,400
consequently restricted capabilities

1541
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,920
must not assume in any server on the

1542
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,799
internet whatever so i just want to

1543
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:11,520
throw that out there

1544
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:16,799
yeah todd i i think it's still a a lousy

1545
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,240
construction

1546
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,160
um but uh

1547
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,079
by the indeed when this is taking

1548
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,160
context with the uh

1549
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,400
with the associated text it it makes

1550
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,400
some sense and actually gives a clue as

1551
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,000
well speaking about what he was intended

1552
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,640
so a very small amount of this problem

1553
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,400
is that the text is recorded out of

1554
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,520
quoted repeatedly out of context

1555
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,799
john said that uh it looks like this

1556
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,480
text was quoted repeatedly out of

1557
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,200
context because we the previous sentence

1558
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,839
is not quoted

1559
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,799
john can you suggest a clarification to

1560
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,680
the sentence

1561
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,279
john clenson

1562
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,120
in real time though

1563
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,640
no no uh uh yeah i'm i'm like in the

1564
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,799
next week or so

1565
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,560
um

1566
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,640
let me uh let me try to do that next

1567
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,799
week or so and uh

1568
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,279
uh and if john

1569
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,799
if the other john wants to have an

1570
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,960
office conversation about how that fits

1571
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,880
should be written i would appreciate it

1572
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,399
uh i would also appreciate for your

1573
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,158
reputation in mind if you would clarify

1574
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,679
how his last name was

1575
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,120
pronounced before we get completely

1576
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,120
confused

1577
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,479
okay

1578
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:55,439
pete

1579
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:58,719
yeah um i asked in the chat room

1580
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,479
uh

1581
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,960
john you you indicated that if we can

1582
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,880
figure out what this means you'd prefer

1583
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,839
to clarify it

1584
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,600
what if we can't figure out the history

1585
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,520
of this sentence would you be more

1586
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,600
inclined to drop it or more inclined to

1587
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,279
just leave it there and ignore

1588
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:21,679
it and anyone else can answer as well

1589
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,439
but i i'm curious what your particular

1590
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:26,000
take on this was um

1591
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,198
my my my prediction especially when it

1592
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,279
looks at the context of this half

1593
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:32,479
sentence

1594
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,000
uh is that we will be able to figure out

1595
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,920
what it means so i hope you're i put

1596
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,560
your case is entirely hypothetical uh

1597
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,640
having said that if we can't figure out

1598
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,560
what it if we cannot make it clear that

1599
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,000
i prefer dropping it then leaving it

1600
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,520
there okay

1601
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,279
all right so yeah i i think that's

1602
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,279
probably the best way forward is john

1603
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,839
will propose a clarification

1604
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,560
if we can agree on it great

1605
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,280
if not uh if it generates lots of other

1606
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,960
discussion and confusion then we'll just

1607
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,800
drop it

1608
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,920
i i i i do think however the condition

1609
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,320
for that is that it is that everybody

1610
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,480
make a good faith effort to

1611
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,800
to to read whatever it is i write and

1612
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,880
then see if we can either fix it or

1613
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,000
agree

1614
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,600
rather than not agreeing in order to

1615
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,280
take it out in order to take this text

1616
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,880
out and that was the reason i was a

1617
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,239
little bit reluctant to answer each

1618
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:22,640
question yes

1619
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,199
absolutely

1620
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,120
everybody should always act in good

1621
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,120
faith

1622
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,880
are you joining the queue pete no no

1623
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,120
all right okay

1624
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,120
okay

1625
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,199
moving on

1626
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,560
uh

1627
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,679
to the next issue that

1628
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:57,280
i would like john and john to discuss

1629
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,600
um

1630
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,520
this is around

1631
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,120
nullimax and some terminology

1632
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,080
up here here i am nope here here i'm not

1633
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,360
um

1634
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,800
did you put in the other the other slide

1635
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,280
that i suggested about this

1636
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,000
yeah there is no slides yeah here we go

1637
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,159
yeah so the question is yeah we have a

1638
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,239
host that handles mail for yeah so

1639
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,719
here's the setup

1640
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:41,320
mail.example.com

1641
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,880
handlesmailforexample.com but not for

1642
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,920
itself

1643
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,440
so if someone sends

1644
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,000
so if someone addresses a message to

1645
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,520
mail.example.com what should it say

1646
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,840
and as the next slide suggests we have

1647
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,480
we have two competing answers one is 550

1648
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,239
which is what it normally says

1649
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:59,440
and the other is 556 which says it's a

1650
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,880
null mx

1651
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,960
and while i don't think 556 is wrong i

1652
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,159
don't think it's i also don't think it's

1653
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,719
realistic i think in my experience mail

1654
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,640
mail servers know what domains they

1655
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,080
handle and they know what domains they

1656
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,520
don't handle but they don't know any

1657
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,040
they don't know why they don't handle

1658
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,040
other domains so this basically would

1659
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,600
require every time a receipt two fails

1660
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,199
you know it's got to do an all mx lookup

1661
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,280
and say oh i know i know what's going on

1662
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,679
there and it's actually you know it's

1663
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:25,360
it's it could be surprisingly

1664
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,040
complicated because

1665
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,880
um it is not rare for mail servers to

1666
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,360
have 100 different names i mean like at

1667
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,280
microsoftoutlook.com

1668
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,640
every

1669
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,120
the mail server has a name has the mail

1670
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,360
server has has a name for every domain

1671
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,040
that it handles you know so

1672
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,560
there's a lot of possible looking up

1673
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,480
there so my inclination is just is i

1674
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,120
think not not to change anything and 550

1675
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,960
550 is the normal response for not our

1676
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,520
mailbox

1677
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,560
john clancy

1678
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,320
actually i just both stay in the queue

1679
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,639
and just

1680
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,199
you're the people who who seem to

1681
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,360
understand the issue you know i i to be

1682
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,719
honest i was a bit confused

1683
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,440
um

1684
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,199
i want to agree with john on two things

1685
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,080
one of which is that this this gets

1686
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,360
rapidly

1687
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,719
and

1688
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:23,440
and the other is that

1689
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,800
probably we're better off just leaving

1690
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,199
it alone

1691
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,559
not going to disagree with that

1692
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,800
sorry did you just suggest no change

1693
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,280
basically

1694
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,400
no change to the document

1695
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,600
okay

1696
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,559
okay

1697
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,400
moving on

1698
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,320
uh

1699
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,400
right this and the following issue is

1700
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,040
actually um

1701
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,960
slides are now out of date because uh

1702
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,800
discussion on the mailing list moved on

1703
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,239
a little bit but we don't have a

1704
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:45,360
proposal text so this is uh

1705
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,159
basically clarifying about

1706
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,090
when

1707
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:55,120
[Music]

1708
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,760
like how blind copies and rcpt to work

1709
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,600
and also

1710
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,719
when the foreclose in the received

1711
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:07,080
header fields can be inserted

1712
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,400
um

1713
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,640
john clanson um you had a proposal you

1714
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,120
would like to pursue

1715
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:34,090
um

1716
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:36,320
[Music]

1717
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,920
i think this this needs some cleaning up

1718
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,760
and uh

1719
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,040
um

1720
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,159
and i don't know whether it's best

1721
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,880
cleaned up here or in the as i think the

1722
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,800
minimum change argument are used for the

1723
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,440
as but uh but that would still require

1724
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,440
some changes here

1725
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,679
uh and uh

1726
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,400
uh and i outlined

1727
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,760
um

1728
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,000
several cases partly the

1729
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,080
complexity here

1730
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,719
is that the statement discussion of

1731
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,320
blind copies

1732
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,199
which i of course wrote as my fault

1733
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,400
uh is is itself

1734
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,080
problematic

1735
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:20,040
because the uh

1736
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:22,880
the an smtp server which is following

1737
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,560
the rules

1738
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,480
uh has no idea what's a blind copy of

1739
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,840
what isn't

1740
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,320
and uh and this gets inexorably tied up

1741
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,679
with four

1742
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,040
and uh

1743
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,400
and i think what i've said on the

1744
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,239
mailing list is probably more articulate

1745
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:39,120
to what i can say this morning

1746
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,120
right so um

1747
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,040
you propose to have a look at this i

1748
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,960
suggest so

1749
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,199
firstly uh

1750
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,360
i talked to pete and he was happy to

1751
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,080
help you out with this

1752
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,120
if you like his help

1753
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,480
i i i always appreciate constructive

1754
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,840
help and peace health is always

1755
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:05,199
constructive okay so petraeus thumb up

1756
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,920
uh so um you will have a look at this

1757
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,360
text

1758
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:13,920
uh suggest clarification uh

1759
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,520
or you know things to delete things to

1760
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,440
add i think

1761
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,960
probably the best way is just you

1762
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,800
suggest set of changes

1763
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,400
we'll review it on the mailing list and

1764
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,199
then we decide which one goes into

1765
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:30,519
base pack which one goes to as if any

1766
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,199
works for me

1767
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,040
okay

1768
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,360
um

1769
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:42,400
again uh if we can get this done within

1770
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,839
a couple of weeks that would be great

1771
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,280
i think we need to to do some kind of

1772
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,120
aerobic exercise in the room everybody

1773
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,440
is sort of like

1774
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,199
come on come on

1775
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:12,440
exercise exercise jump up and down

1776
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,800
uh

1777
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,480
well they already had so much coffee

1778
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,480
there you know

1779
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,799
um

1780
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,960
right trying to get through the rest uh

1781
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,280
as energetically as possible

1782
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,239
this is a follow-up on the discussion we

1783
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,199
had at the january interim

1784
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:38,000
about the text which seems to prohibit

1785
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,719
list exploders to

1786
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,800
add any header fields

1787
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,480
uh

1788
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,400
i think where we'll end it with this on

1789
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,920
the mailing list there are four options

1790
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,679
no change

1791
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,000
remove the set uh

1792
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,120
in option one uh the sentence

1793
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,760
and the discussion is actually listed

1794
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,800
second choice remove the sentence

1795
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,000
um third replace it with

1796
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,840
this change to mail from doesn't affect

1797
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,920
the header section of the message

1798
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,560
for this change uh replace it with the

1799
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,320
this change to mail from doesn't affect

1800
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,159
the header field that is already present

1801
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,799
in the message

1802
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:23,239
um

1803
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,880
i don't want to have the whole

1804
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,199
discussion all over again so i pro i

1805
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:29,360
think

1806
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,520
john and i are happy with choice three

1807
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,440
and four

1808
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,440
if people have any strong object

1809
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,120
objections

1810
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,920
if people have preferences for either

1811
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,760
three or four maybe we can have a quick

1812
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,159
discussion here

1813
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:47,799
battery set three

1814
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,520
ken says

1815
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,000
whatever

1816
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,839
pete is shaking his head as well

1817
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:11,678
okay and the winner is number three

1818
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:15,120
um i mean uh realistically number three

1819
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,040
and number four is kind of so close that

1820
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,080
i don't think it matters

1821
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,519
in absence of

1822
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,840
any objections

1823
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,159
i think john

1824
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:31,679
please implement change number three

1825
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:35,120
and i can close this issue

1826
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,880
sorry i was distracted by an emergency

1827
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,679
telephone call

1828
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,080
the only advantage of four over three

1829
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,920
is that if there was some weird case

1830
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,679
which so far nobody's been able to

1831
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,280
identify

1832
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,040
that uh

1833
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,520
that would uh would cause somebody to

1834
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,520
want to put a

1835
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,840
um

1836
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,480
trace or other sort of receipts other

1837
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,840
sort of fields

1838
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,440
into the message

1839
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,080
that indicated what was done here

1840
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,840
uh three prohibits that

1841
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,080
probably and four does not accept that

1842
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,760
three is uh

1843
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,120
except that there's already text there

1844
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,120
and says you can't cannot change any

1845
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,960
header fields that's already in the

1846
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,080
message so they're

1847
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:29,040
uh right right click i i guess you write

1848
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,320
me down is indifferent and if the

1849
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,080
consensus is three i'm happy with it

1850
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,719
okay mary

1851
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:43,000
gal this is barry lieber um

1852
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,239
the way i read this is the the the text

1853
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,320
that isn't quoted that comes before this

1854
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,000
just says you have to do this stuff to

1855
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,159
the mail from yes you change the mail

1856
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,719
from the only thing that we need to say

1857
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,560
is and we're just talking about the mail

1858
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,560
from here it does not affect the message

1859
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,679
headers

1860
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,080
and that's the straightforward thing

1861
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,120
that

1862
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,280
and that's why i prefer three

1863
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,199
i don't mind four but i think three is

1864
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,560
all we need to say and it's less

1865
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,199
confusing than anything else

1866
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:14,199
wow

1867
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,840
okay all right all right

1868
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:37,760
okay

1869
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,600
so what's that they've had a question in

1870
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,639
the in the chat room um in the the jab

1871
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:45,199
room whatever so

1872
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,519
okay

1873
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:53,280
yeah this is pete to answer dave yes i i

1874
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,320
think the reason we need to say

1875
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,800
something here is because people have

1876
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,080
had trouble with this people think that

1877
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,000
changing the mail from means that they

1878
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,440
have to change the from field in the

1879
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,920
message which is a bad thing

1880
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,880
and

1881
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:09,679
this

1882
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:11,360
clarifies

1883
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,960
that we only mean

1884
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,040
changing the mail from doesn't affect

1885
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,280
the message header in any way as far as

1886
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,960
instruction goes there's an instruction

1887
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,840
here

1888
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,840
um that we're going to be leaving in

1889
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,639
which talks about changing the mail from

1890
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:28,800
but that doesn't affect the header

1891
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,920
section so i think this clarifies and

1892
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,840
doesn't change what's currently in the

1893
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,760
text it just clarifies the meaning of

1894
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,360
what's in the text that people have

1895
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,480
screwed up in the past

1896
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,199
yeah and adding to that the reason we

1897
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:44,960
want to make some change to this is that

1898
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,360
some people have interpreted the message

1899
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:50,080
header section must be left unchanged is

1900
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,360
that you're not allowed to make any

1901
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,600
other unrelated changes to the message

1902
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,000
header if you're a male exploder and we

1903
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,480
want to dissuade them that we want to

1904
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,840
make it clear that we're not talking

1905
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,520
about that at all

1906
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,120
yeah

1907
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,800
dave

1908
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,440
so i'll repeat the point

1909
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,840
mailing list exploders

1910
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,440
are acting long after mail delivery

1911
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,120
they're creating a new message and

1912
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,199
they're posting it

1913
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,840
so the problem here is much deeper than

1914
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,480
this bit of text fixes

1915
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,400
the idea that we have a separate ticket

1916
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,639
for that

1917
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,560
we have a separate ticket about male

1918
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,440
explorers which i i postpone because ned

1919
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,000
is not here

1920
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,159
you're right we need to do some other

1921
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,360
changes

1922
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,320
if that's where you're going with it

1923
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,760
so my

1924
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,480
to to apply the point here that says

1925
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,639
option two

1926
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,400
remove the sentence

1927
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,920
the sentence is

1928
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,840
that i mean this is sort of beyond layer

1929
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,080
violation

1930
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,199
since it's

1931
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:02,560
53 21 talking about 53 22 topics but it

1932
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,199
it's sort of beyond that in that it's

1933
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:06,719
trying to fix a problem with something

1934
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:08,560
that's completely out of scope for this

1935
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,120
spec the fact that historically it was

1936
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,560
in the spec

1937
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,400
at the time was

1938
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,040
there weren't really meaningful choices

1939
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,840
were 30 years later

1940
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,239
yeah let's

1941
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,159
for what it's worth i i i could live

1942
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,159
with two i think three

1943
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:43,920
adds the clarity that we were trying to

1944
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,600
get to but i could live with two as well

1945
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,960
right let's just go ahead with three and

1946
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,600
done with this one

1947
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,440
right

1948
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,320
right so peter's saying if we're going

1949
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,320
to discuss alice's and mailing list

1950
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,239
clarification so there is a separate

1951
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:49,600
ticket for this

1952
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,760
we were supposed to discuss it and ned

1953
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,600
was supposed to propose some text or

1954
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,159
possible document but

1955
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:59,600
he got delayed so um

1956
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,560
we are going to do this later

1957
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,080
so how much time do we actually have

1958
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,320
left

1959
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,199
half an hour

1960
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,080
i'm going to mix up things a little bit

1961
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,159
because i am

1962
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,120
in the front and i can

1963
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,639
um

1964
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,400
todd

1965
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:33,000
do you want to do a quick recap of

1966
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,080
your slide

1967
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,239
sure

1968
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,080
um

1969
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:40,880
i

1970
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,159
posted

1971
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,239
i've posted several revs of proposed

1972
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:47,120
text to the list

1973
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,760
since january the most recent was

1974
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,520
earlier this week

1975
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,920
um incorporating whatever comments have

1976
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,000
been made after the interim

1977
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,360
alexi made a few minor comments

1978
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,120
i have incorporated them in my working

1979
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,199
document but haven't posted them to the

1980
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:06,560
list or in the ticket or anywhere

1981
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,040
i would encourage people to

1982
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,960
look at the list and

1983
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,239
give it another

1984
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:14,960
pass when they get a chance uh

1985
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,440
let me get you the proper

1986
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,360
or the the actual subject name here as

1987
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,080
soon as i can find it in my threads

1988
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:22,960
uh

1989
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,280
the subject is ticket number 54

1990
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,800
authentication and encryption for a

1991
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,800
asrev4

1992
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,880
so if anyone uh wants to take a look at

1993
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,360
the list and make some more

1994
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,360
suggestions uh

1995
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:38,639
i appreciate it

1996
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:40,159
but that's really i'm not going to sit

1997
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,520
here and read the text to everybody

1998
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,840
today

1999
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,679
pete

2000
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,440
sorry i missed that

2001
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,040
pete seems to be in the queue but i

2002
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,000
don't see him okay

2003
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,800
right so um

2004
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,520
let me make a proposal maybe we have a

2005
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,840
couple of maybe you can post the latest

2006
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,120
version

2007
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,120
we'll have a couple of weeks of comments

2008
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,560
and then if there are no further

2009
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,480
comments then ken just can incorporate

2010
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,040
the text

2011
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,239
okay it's like one big section with

2012
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:27,120
sub-sections you know so but i mean yeah

2013
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,719
yeah that's fine with me

2014
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:33,040
ken loves text already written for him

2015
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,360
sounds perfect

2016
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,840
okay are you

2017
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,520
ready are you ready for the last ticket

2018
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,000
of the day

2019
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,760
are you ready to

2020
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,199
can i get your commitment to be

2021
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:04,199
productive

okay

2023
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,920
right

2024
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,719
you can see why i did i didn't want to

2025
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,600
do it earlier

2026
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,840
right

2027
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:30,400
john mentioned some of it

2028
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,560
earlier on in relationship to other

2029
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,560
tickets

2030
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,639
basically question is whether existing

2031
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:45,520
use of

2032
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,239
mta is sufficiently defined whether

2033
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,560
we want to use senders mtp and receive

2034
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:59,520
smtp instead of smtp client smtp server

2035
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,679
okay

2036
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:08,480
and the next slide is definition of mta

2037
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,360
i wrote this slide long time ago my

2038
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,840
proposal is to do no change but you know

2039
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,600
if

2040
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,400
if we can get some useful discussion out

2041
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,320
of this topic

2042
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,639
john

2043
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,400
uh there's uh

2044
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,440
a small interesting complication here

2045
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,520
and i think some of it is changes the

2046
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,600
working group told me to make

2047
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,679
this time around and some of it may have

2048
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,080
crept in in five three two one

2049
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,480
but at this stage the document contains

2050
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,080
both sets of terminology in different

2051
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,600
places

2052
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,000
and the principle of minimal change

2053
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,480
would say that uh that we just leave it

2054
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,960
alone the principle of maximum clarity

2055
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,400
says we've got to make a decision and i

2056
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,960
should clean it up and i'm agnostic

2057
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,159
between those two principles

2058
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,560
actually i prefer the minimal change one

2059
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,920
because it's less work but that's not a

2060
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,719
very good excuse

2061
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,519
pete

2062
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,760
miss pete reznick i

2063
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,000
i actually would argue in favor of

2064
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,080
minimal change on

2065
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,320
um what i now take to be the crocker

2066
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,679
principle of

2067
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:29,440
this really hasn't screwed up anybody as

2068
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,440
far as i can tell

2069
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,800
no one has

2070
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,120
come to us and said what the heck does

2071
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,000
this mean or that mean i think people

2072
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,840
get it now sufficiently that

2073
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,239
we could leave this exactly as it is and

2074
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:45,840
it really wouldn't affect implementation

2075
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,159
at all

2076
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,520
yes

2077
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,920
speaking as a participant i i have kind

2078
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,800
of similar feeling that

2079
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,719
even though the observation that there

2080
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,960
might be two set of terminology used is

2081
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,320
correct

2082
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,320
it doesn't seem to affect readability of

2083
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,400
the document

2084
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,560
shall i quickly close close this ticket

2085
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:20,440
and everybody can go home

2086
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,360
going once

2087
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:39,600
ken wants the last word

2088
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,000
i have no strong opinion on

2089
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,080
what we do but i just noticed that the

2090
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,320
proposed text that i have for the

2091
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,199
as document with regards to

2092
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:51,440
enhance status codes uses sender and

2093
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,840
receiver so

2094
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:56,560
in the interest of

2095
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,159
being consistent i assume you want to

2096
01:33:58,159 --> 01:33:59,520
change that

2097
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,560
to be client server

2098
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:07,360
and pete has a response

2099
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,400
yeah this is pete since

2100
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,480
john said that there are still instances

2101
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,280
of both of these floating around in 5321

2102
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,520
i think the as could do well

2103
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,960
to

2104
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,760
clarify the meanings of these terms and

2105
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,040
and

2106
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,159
you know

2107
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:26,639
be explicit that

2108
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:30,000
5321 uses both sets of these terms and

2109
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,800
and

2110
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,400
they both mean the same you know they

2111
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,239
both mean the same thing but

2112
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:37,040
um i don't think there's

2113
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,040
any particular reason to go one way or

2114
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,880
the other in the as

2115
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,119
we'll pick one when we get to that you

2116
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:45,600
know uh discussion but

2117
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,960
you're going to

2118
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,719
that as is there for clarification

2119
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:50,639
purposes anyway we might as well clarify

2120
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,760
in there if we're going to do it

2121
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:01,199
okay hold on

2122
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,678
thank you

2123
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,040
hans yeah is this antioch um i would

2124
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,960
like to say i probably prefer send a

2125
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,800
receiver because there's an smt client

2126
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,719
for me could also be a mail user agent

2127
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,000
you know sending the email this is

2128
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,840
actually a client for me

2129
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,960
um and also like the sender smtp still

2130
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,719
techn in a technical sense might be an

2131
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:23,280
smtp server component and in fact in

2132
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,040
many situations it is just the same

2133
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,679
piece of fulfilling the role of a sender

2134
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:30,560
smtp and a receiver smtp

2135
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,600
yeah

2136
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,920
but i agree that probably it won't have

2137
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,159
much of an influence

2138
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:38,400
on interpreting the rfc but as i hear

2139
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,719
this is also used in other

2140
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:43,199
contexts might be still worth thinking

2141
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:45,599
about that

2142
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,239
okay i think you're volunteering to

2143
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:51,280
review the whole document and point out

2144
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:56,440
every case where it might be better

2145
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:59,679
are you scared yet

2146
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:05,119
yes you cannot leave the room i will

2147
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:07,920
lock the door as i said

2148
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:08,880
um

2149
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,840
john

2150
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,960
yeah in indeed uh following up on the

2151
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,400
last comment

2152
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,000
um most of the cases where one senator

2153
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,920
where the

2154
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,480
sender and receiver terminology was

2155
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,639
introduced or reintroduced

2156
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,600
are cases where what is talking about a

2157
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,480
uh

2158
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,480
a single piece of software acting in

2159
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,960
both capacities and the and that

2160
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,360
distinction is is more helpful than

2161
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,600
talking about it is the server or the

2162
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,159
client it may not be entirely consistent

2163
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:44,400
that way and the question i'd like to

2164
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,920
ask is whether people would object to

2165
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:48,960
um

2166
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,880
simply inserting the sentence that a

2167
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,159
sentence equivalent to what murray

2168
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:53,440
suggested

2169
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,440
uh into uh

2170
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,040
in the thing which says that in general

2171
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,560
these two things are just uh

2172
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,400
interchangeable these two sets of things

2173
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,560
just interchange and would move on that

2174
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,920
that's a clarification which really

2175
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,440
ought to be made

2176
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,360
for people reading

2177
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:12,480
5321 bis and not merely in the as

2178
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,718
okay

2179
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:18,920
i think that makes sense

2180
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:22,480
i just wanted to be sure that before i

2181
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,320
put it in that there were

2182
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,000
were no strong objections on the claim

2183
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,600
that it was on the basis that it was a

2184
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,280
claim we that it was a change we didn't

2185
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,199
absolutely need

2186
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:34,199
okay

2187
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:42,080
right

2188
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,159
with this

2189
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,360
i think we at the end of the

2190
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,839
session um

2191
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,199
nobody complained

2192
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:06,239
okay

2193
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,480
yeah

2194
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:11,600
um i uh i was

2195
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,400
uh

2196
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,480
i want to talk about

2197
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,839
whether we do interims or not

2198
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,800
so um

2199
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,520
as you might or might not know i spent

2200
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,679
probably five hours this week working on

2201
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:27,920
slides and communicating with everybody

2202
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,719
this is taking quite a bit of time

2203
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,960
um

2204
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:35,679
i think it would be nice to be done

2205
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:39,199
so we have email format document in

2206
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:42,840
walking group plus call very soon

2207
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,400
uh

2208
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,560
i would like to maybe have one or two

2209
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,520
interims to just nail the remaining

2210
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,760
issues we have some of the stuff we are

2211
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,000
going to discuss on the mailing list

2212
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,400
like the whole exciting and registration

2213
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,400
procedure

2214
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,600
then again if this is the most exciting

2215
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,840
topic no let's have an interim to

2216
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,639
discuss that

2217
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,600
interim to decide the next set of

2218
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,840
tickets to discuss on the next interim

2219
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,840
you might as well get my job then you

2220
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:22,239
know just just just just just take it

2221
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:29,280
so do people think about interim

2222
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:32,000
in a month or two

2223
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,440
i'd like to make a case for people

2224
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:38,560
actually

2225
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:39,840
trying to deal with these things on the

2226
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,159
mailing list the extent possible

2227
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:44,800
uh it is at least for me much more much

2228
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,320
easier to

2229
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,239
uh get texts into documents based on

2230
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:50,000
mail english discussions

2231
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,920
than to remember what happened in an

2232
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,920
oral discussion and

2233
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:56,000
and transcribe for minutes

2234
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,239
uh and uh and in theory we shouldn't be

2235
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,080
making any of these decisions

2236
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,719
without confirmation on the mailing list

2237
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:05,199
so if between now and the next ietf for

2238
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:09,040
the next interim or the next lawn party

2239
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,960
uh we can all pay more attention to

2240
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,040
mailing list and uh

2241
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,719
and and respond to things there make

2242
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:16,400
suggestions there

2243
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,280
um

2244
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,800
i think it'd be

2245
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,639
well be much more efficient for me and i

2246
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,280
and i think for everybody else

2247
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,639
uh john i i agree

2248
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:29,840
but you know from our recent experience

2249
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,800
obviously interims and

2250
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,840
video meetings

2251
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,239
uh serve as a focus point so we do get

2252
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:40,159
progress on things we get stuck and

2253
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,080
unfortunately we sometimes get on the

2254
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,639
stuck on little things

2255
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,400
absolutely and it's been very clear that

2256
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,199
the interims have caused a uh a focusing

2257
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:50,960
of attention and a burst of activity

2258
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,800
which is worthwhile

2259
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,360
uh i was just making a plea for and and

2260
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,960
and based on experience that's the right

2261
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,960
thing to do i was just making a plea for

2262
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,960
a change in behavior if you want to

2263
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,199
schedule an interim and then

2264
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:04,560
we can accomplish a lot of the mailing

2265
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,080
lists and then cancel the interim i

2266
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,600
think that'd be great

2267
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:08,960
that would be

2268
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,360
fine with me

2269
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,159
uh

2270
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:14,400
yeah uh this is pete just

2271
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,000
to agree with that

2272
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,159
i would prefer you get the interim

2273
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:19,920
scheduled because

2274
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,199
getting

2275
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:23,119
getting time on the calendar for a good

2276
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:25,760
block is sometimes tricky

2277
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:26,560
and

2278
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,719
uh you know getting it on the calendar

2279
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:30,320
and if we have to cancel it is way

2280
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,560
better than waiting to see if we need it

2281
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,040
and then trying to squeeze it in

2282
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:39,520
fine so uh todd and i will try to

2283
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,159
pick a date

2284
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,639
maybe early next week

2285
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:46,400
early next week pick a date you know in

2286
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,679
a month months month or or two you know

2287
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,239
now we'll we'll just have interims

2288
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,320
monday tuesday wednesday thursday and

2289
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,400

2292
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,719
murray

2299
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:25,920
so with this the meeting is closed any

2300
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,719
other business

2301
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:30,159
yeah come

2302
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:31,840
on

2303
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,040
is it is it uh

2304
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,639
okay it's a question for the draft

2305
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:41,920
actually okay yeah fine sorry for but i

2306
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,199
mean

2307
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:45,520
maybe for it anyway uh so when i was

2308
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,639
looking through my notes i was thinking

2309
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:48,080
about what's going on here so i

2310
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,239
understand you basically went through

2311
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:53,440
those two rfcs mentioned in the charter

2312
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,440
sentence by sentence and try to figure

2313
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,520
out where there are inconsistencies or

2314
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,440
clarities right

2315
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:00,560
um

2316
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:03,199
not quite sentence by sentence but yeah

2317
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:05,760
well okay some of us yes paid more

2318
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,159
attention to some sections so when

2319
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:11,920
singing about smtp one thing that comes

2320
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,000
to my mind which for me at least seems

2321
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,320
to be unclear in terms of overall rfc

2322
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:19,040
coverage is sub-addressing

2323
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,040
so as far as i know sub-addressing like

2324
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,119
these plus addresses you should use for

2325
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:25,760
uh um or you could use in siri for you

2326
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,040
know

2327
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,000
um

2328
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,480
doing nice things uh with your email

2329
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,360
it's actually only mentioned in an rc by

2330
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,040
this guy in front of you it's only

2331
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:38,639
insane yeah because it's um

2332
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,639
so if we are talking about clarification

2333
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:44,719
of um rfcs in particular smt prcs it

2334
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,159
might be worth why i'm mentioning it i

2335
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:47,679
don't know okay

2336
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:48,560
um

2337
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,119
it's a local convention even though

2338
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:53,520
commonly implemented one so it's kind of

2339
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:56,080
out of scope for this mtp itself it was

2340
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,360
just an observation okay

2341
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,440
and i jumped in the queue to say if if

2342
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,880
we want to put something like that in

2343
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,800
the applicability statement we can

2344
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,960
discuss that in the context of the

2345
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,400
applicability statement but it's

2346
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:12,159
definitely out of scope for smtp

2347
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:14,400
okay

2348
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,520
fine

2349
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,480
on that note

2350
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:25,199
i think we're done

2351
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,080
thank you for thank you for attending

2352
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:31,440

so first come first serve wins as the

2356
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,600
most ridiculous discussion of the entire

2357
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:42,480
meeting

2358
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,119
