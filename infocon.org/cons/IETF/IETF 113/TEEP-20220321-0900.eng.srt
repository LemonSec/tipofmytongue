this one

11
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,959

12
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,239
in to me

13
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,599

17
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,239
difference really it's just a big

18
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560

things okay

27
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,519
okay let me refresh screen

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,480
oops

29
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,200
well

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
yeah that was interesting okay well

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,480
maybe he got

32
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,040
bumped out and i got bumped out

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,200
go back

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
yeah whoops okay so you know that you

35
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,640
obviously yeah i i had everything turned

36
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
off okay yeah

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
i figured that

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,959
here we go

39
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,519
seeing stuff and then um

40
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
yeah so i thought i went in here go in

41
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,680
there try that and there they are there

42
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,200
they are okay

43
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,480
if you want to see them yourself you've

44
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,920
got to go to that view once you've

45
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,799
opened them up because that's the

46
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,159
presentation view but you haven't opened

47
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,799
them up yet well that's what i did and

48
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,720
got it but they weren't there

49
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
well no that's when it put me on the

50
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,920
data tracker

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
see

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,680
oh i see um interesting okay so let's go

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
back and then

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,840
let's see what happens

55
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
oh because you're going to share maybe

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,879
from

57
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
these presentation

58
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,879
gallery

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,600
yeah it used to be that i could click

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
and it would automatically present oh

61
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,440
but you know it was virtual i don't know

62
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,639
if that means yeah it should be

63
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,840
basically the same um

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,360
just that

65
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,240
i mean

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,000
i could just go to my folder and share

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,240
i know but let's see if you do

68
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,280
somebody's supposed to be coming who

69
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
knows more than me but obviously i don't

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
know anything but you know we'll figure

71
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,960
it out so if you were to go to that

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
that again

73
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,000
you're really just in the data center

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,479
that doesn't make any sense

75
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,400
um right you're right yeah okay let's go

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,919
back to teep

77
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,000
and then

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,880
that's how you share screening

79
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,479
what if you if you click share let's see

80
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,160
what happens

81
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
and then it might ask you ah

82
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,600
yes do you really want to yes but but

83
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,960
what do you want to share and if you go

84
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,039
to present

85
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,560
oh it's just a task i think that's a you

86
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,759
know

87
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,320
unfortunately

88
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,320
yeah

89
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
i don't know what it was asking you to

90
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
share but let's see

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,759
if you'll

92
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,440
share and you can share a tab or window

93
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
or the whole thing so if you wanted to

94
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,320
share a chrome tab or whatever i think

95
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,840
oh look and then you can pick

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,440
yeah but that wasn't the whole point

97
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
okay there's that but it's not so but

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,080
it's interesting oh because that's going

99
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,800
to be the case i see the cue okay so

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
this may be good enough

101
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
yeah do you want to change the the view

102
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
of it so it's like

103
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,520
i don't know

104
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,880
yeah how do i turn it into

105
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,560
what are presentations can you hover

106
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
over those and see what they are

107
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,120
good to fit the page

108
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
that's gonna know that's gonna rotate it

109
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,720
so you want to close it

110
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,400
behind the scenes uh was there something

111
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
actually wrong i don't know

112
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,039
okay um they they up yeah yeah oh they

113
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,400
do too what's that over there maybe we

114
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
collapse that

115
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
yeah okay so now you can okay

116
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,400
with them you know meeting minutes that

150
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,240
would be great

151
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,280
sure

152
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,479

153
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,319
so with that

154
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,879
welcome everybody to the trusted

155
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,280
execution environment provisioning we

156
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
were lucky enough to get the very first

157
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
slot of the very first day of the very

158
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,039
first hybrid ietf113

159
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,879
so

160
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,360
the notewell still applies i believe

161
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
most of you

162
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,639
given that i'm running late i won't read

163
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
it most of you should be familiar with

164
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,400
it

165
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,280
meeting tips the only thing

166
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,479
that i

167
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,039
thought i noted was to ensure that

168
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,399
you're launching the meat echo

169
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,958
and for the the meat echo i usually

170
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,679
launch it straight from the website

171
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,959
agenda

172
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,080
um

173
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,399
and that's how i've gotten it to work

174
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,160
for those that are here i think

175
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,640
hopefully you all have turned your

176
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,560
at least your mech so you we don't get

177
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,279
the double echo which i'm not hearing

178
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,040
um

179
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,399
and then for the remote participants

180
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
to improve your bandwidth keep your

181
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,720
audio and video off until you are ready

182
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,560
to get on the queue

183
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
and one of the chairs either and i

184
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
could recognize you okay so

185
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,000
um code of conduct still applies we went

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
through that last

187
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
time i think this is a pretty small and

188
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,120
chill group

189
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,640
we're courteous

190
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,120
to each other

191
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
and be prepared to contribute and

192
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
discuss

193
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,839
the deep work okay

194
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,640
so um jabber is now attached to medeco

195
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,480
um we've got the chat going

196
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,440
i can see the queue on this other screen

197
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
if you can help me with the queue as

198
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
well

199
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,320
we can go ahead and get going okay so

200
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
for the agenda bash um

201
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,440
i believe i made all of the updates but

202
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,040
i want to make sure we got them all

203
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,160
straight so dave i've allocated 15

204
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,040
minutes for the architecture

205
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,240
10 minutes for the

206
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,839
transport one

207
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,399
and then i was going to have akira

208
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,680
go next

209
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,480
to go over the hackathon report

210
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,720
and then give you as much time and um

211
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,800
unless you really need more than the 45

212
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,320
minutes what i was trying to do is

213
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,519
allocate the last 10 minutes to uh

214
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,640
pengling

215
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,959
who wanted to present on confidential

216
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,519
computing aware network

217
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,519
so any any changes to the agenda

218
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,399
or are we good to go

219
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,240
are we awake

220
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,279
both in the room and virtually

221
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,399
all right

222
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,760
i will i will count that as a as a go so

223
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
with that dave you want to kick it off

224
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,839
and um

225
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,680
it'll be easier if you share your slides

226
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,079
for me

227
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,040
and

228
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
okay trying again can you hear me okay

229
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,360
nancy

230
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,560
yes i can and i gave you access

231
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
yeah i can hear myself laying in the

232
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,680
room

233
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
so

234
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,000
so i granted you screen but i'm not

235
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,880
seeing your slides so nancy i think only

236
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,200
one person can be sharing slides at a

237
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,519
time so you would need to stop sharing

238
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
in order for dave to be able to do so

239
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,160
i i did it again

240
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,000
so go ahead dave and try it again

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,320
okay

242
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,360
ah

243
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,760
i believe your

244
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,720
your deck should be coming up dave

245
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,079
there we go

246
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,600
you can see screen now

247
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,120
yes we can all right

248
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,639
switch

249
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,320
there all right that should look okay i

250
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
hope

251
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,639
yes

252
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,519
all right

253
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,200
hopefully the audio holds out throughout

254
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
this uh session hey everyone

255
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,360
good to see people virtually

256
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,680
uh so i'm gonna be talking about the

257
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,279
draft 16 of the architecture document

258
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,440
just as a reminder in our timeline uh we

259
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,200
did complete working group last call

260
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,440
some time ago we held the document until

261
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,399
we were

262
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,600
more sure that there were not going to

263
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,240
be changes based on the protocol spec uh

264
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
so then we got to that point in july of

265
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,040
2021 we submitted to iesg

266
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,519
uh ben recently posted some feedback

267
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,639
there's the link there that we're going

268
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,320
to go through and the draft was then

269
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,480
updated and so draft 16 the main changes

270
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
are to address ben's feedback

271
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,959
all right

272
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,720
so i'm going to walk through uh ben's

273
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
comments and then talk about what's

274
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,720
changed in the spec and so this is

275
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,399
literally ben's comments on the slide

276
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,920
here in the next two or what we did to

277
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,279
address it so i'm going to call out some

278
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,720
main points here

279
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,639
that ben raised this is the comment that

280
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,399
i call the double-edged sword in the

281
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,040
first line comment here

282
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,279
and so he talks about

283
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,550
the

284
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,240
[Music]

285
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,480
context of the architecture and maybe

286
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
some security or privacy considerations

287
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,760
right so i'll highlight in the second

288
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,560
paragraph he talks about um refers to

289
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,519
rfc 8890 which is uh entitled the

290
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,320
internet is for end users

291
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,199
and it talks about in a te type of

292
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,240
situation right then the risk is the

293
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,160
perception of the conflict where the

294
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
user doesn't have any rights because you

295
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,639
can't see what's going on inside the dee

296
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,800
and he says uh it might be good to have

297
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,560
the to acknowledge there's cases of the

298
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
main value of teeth and this is ben's uh

299
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,639
wording right it's the device owners

300
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,720
potentially at risk of harm to users and

301
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
discuss the trade-offs involved

302
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,639
and then the last point that's part of

303
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,959
this is uh about that the tam is a

304
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,480
trusted party

305
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
and so to document the new privacy

306
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
exposure where

307
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,959
the you know cam has access potentially

308
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,000
to things that say the user is sitting

309
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,079
in front of the device if there is one

310
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,760
if there is a user there that there may

311
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
be some privacy exposure there right so

312
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
that's kind of the summary of this old

313
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,120
uh of this one here

314
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,920
and so we made two changes one is the uh

315
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,000
introduction to set the context and then

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
one is in the privacy considerations

317
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,320
section so

318
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,279
um this is is formatted with bolding and

319
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,519
things um but this is the text was added

320
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,680
into the introduction section

321
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,360
okay so there's already some text there

322
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,199
and so this is just the new text in

323
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,120
addition to all the other text that was

324
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
already there that hinted at some of the

325
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,199
things that ben is pointing out this is

326
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,600
the additional text

327
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,839
so the top line is one of the points it

328
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,639
says

329
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,279
tes are typically used in cases where a

330
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,360
software or data asset needs to be

331
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,920
protected from unauthorized entities

332
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,639
that may include the owner or owner or

333
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,760
possessor of a device okay that phrase

334
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,240
is roughly taken out of a conference

335
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,120
computing consortium white paper

336
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
where a number of teat participants help

337
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,160
to uh review and or author the text in

338
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,279
the white paper and so my hope is that

339
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,759
the ccc white paper which we'll see uh

340
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,440
link to the references from the bottom

341
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,199
of the slide there and in the document

342
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,199
in the actual references section

343
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,279
would be okay with this but a couple of

344
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,199
common examples that hopefully people

345
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,000
can um understand is things like a

346
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,040
gaming console right where whoever is in

347
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
physical possession of the gaming

348
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
console right you're trying to protect

349
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,079
the game against somebody cheating uh

350
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,440
simply because they have access to a

351
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
gaming console

352
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
things like you know an atm what the

353
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,399
user standing in front of the atm is not

354
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,040
the one that's authorized to

355
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,880
decide how much money comes out of that

356
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,839
device things like you know cell phones

357
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,600
where it's used by mobile payments

358
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,199
hosted cloud environments and so on all

359
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,360
these are very common use cases for tes

360
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
in general what you'll see is there's

361
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,560
nothing in this text here that's

362
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
actually specific to t right this is

363
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
just explaining background information

364
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,399
about the security assumptions

365
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,160
and usability assumptions what is the

366
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,320
trust model around common te cases to

367
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
begin with right this is before we get

368
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,160
into the actual protocol part of the

369
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,680
intro

370
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,399
and so to combat the particular risk of

371
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
oh this conflicts with the internet is

372
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,959
for end users rfc right the point is

373
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,880
that such environments can be thought of

374
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,759
as hybrid devices where one user right

375
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,680
or administrator controls the rich

376
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
execution environment where a different

377
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,320
a remote user administrator controls the

378
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,639
tee in the same physical device right so

379
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,000
the pointers are two different types of

380
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,279
users right the one in physical

381
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,360
possession and the user that's actually

382
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,720
authorized do you think but both of them

383
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,399
are users right and so to try to put

384
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,680
forward this note that says it's

385
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,359
actually for young users but just

386
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,799
different classes of end users that

387
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,199
control different things right

388
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,839
and so then the last point is that um

389
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,760
there's also cases there is no local

390
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
user there's only a remote user and this

391
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,599
would come up often in many you know iot

392
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,000
cases with headless devices where the

393
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,799
only user is the remote te administrator

394
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,760
per se

395
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,319
and then we refer to uh ccc white papers

396
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,319
that provide a much longer analysis

397
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,760
because again this point that then

398
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440
raised this part is not really about the

399
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,120
t protocol this is just about setting

400
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
the context for tes in general okay so

401
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,640
that's why we thought it was useful to

402
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,320
reference the ccc white papers about use

403
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,679
about uh

404
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,520
usability sort of

405
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,280
use use cases and scenarios for

406
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,559
confidential computing in general and

407
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,960
tes in general okay so that was what we

408
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,520
did in the introduction text

409
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
and then the security considerations was

410
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,640
the other part of the privacy

411
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,039
considerations in particular

412
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,880
so again this is the actual snippet of

413
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
new code this was a new little section

414
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,679
that was added to the privacy

415
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,160
considerations primarily for ben's last

416
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,600
point that you may be reviewing

417
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,520
information to the tam including

418
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
information about a particular person

419
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,799
that's sitting in front of the machine

420
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,160
and let me finish this slide i see

421
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
brennan's and q so as soon as i finish

422
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,120
this slide i'll go back to whichever

423
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,480
spot you want right now

424
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,080
um

425
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,120
so

426
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,080
uh

427
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
in the privacy considerations right

428
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,600
again it starts with by reminding us of

429
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,360
that applicability right this goes back

430
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,960
to that intro text

431
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,880
devices have a te that protects data

432
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,200
encode from the ree administrator right

433
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,960
is one of the cases right and then again

434
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,799
there's two examples the cloud hoster

435
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,679
case

436
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,000
and the device manufacturer case

437
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and this is where the privacy risk is

438
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
that uh data in the ree might be

439
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,160
susceptible to disclosure to the te

440
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,720
administrator

441
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,640
and to explicitly choose to have a te

442
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,480
that's managed by another party and so

443
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,080
just to take those two particular cases

444
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
the cloud poster example right

445
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,799
the choice to say um the re

446
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,640
administrator is explicitly aware of the

447
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,720
tu administrator it's because in this

448
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,240
example the cloud hoster is offering a

449
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,320
service right your t administrator can

450
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
become a customer of the cloud and your

451
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,080
ge administrator can then manage things

452
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,520
that are host in the cloud so that is

453
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,120
the business model right

454
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,280
in the device manufacturer case like a

455
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
you know gaming console or

456
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,160
something like that then it's a choice

457
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,600
made by the person that purchases the

458
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,200
device that you know that you're not

459
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,320
going to have complete control over the

460
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
gaming console right here because you're

461
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,360
trying to get you know gaming out of it

462
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,960
or whatever so there's two examples

463
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,760
right

464
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,440
one because a service is offered in one

465
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,960
direction and the other one is because

466
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,160
you know you make a purchasing choice

467
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,840
those are just different examples of how

468
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,520
to mitigate those risks what those are

469
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,039
just taken as examples all right so with

470
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,720
that i see brennan is into you so

471
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,520
go ahead brendan

472
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,520
hi brendan morin

473
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,360
can we go back to privacy considerations

474
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,918
one please

475
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,559
okay so uh there's this question here

476
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,640
about the double-edged sword and uh

477
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
proving or and and the the user

478
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,280
uh agreeing or accepting that the tam is

479
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,360
going to deliver what it says it will

480
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
deliver that's the whole point of of

481
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,760
attestation not remote attestation in

482
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,679
this case but local attestation can't we

483
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,640
fix this up with attestation

484
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,600
um you can fix up part of that testation

485
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,960
attestation certainly half of that

486
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,559
that's how you know the tam is who you

487
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,120
think it is right you don't have nothing

488
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,720
no that's not what i mean

489
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,159
okay i'm not talking about remote

490
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,919
attestation i'm talking about local

491
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,919
attestation the te proving to the user

492
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,520
that it is

493
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,480
uh

494
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
indeed running the software it said it

495
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,399
would run

496
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,799
yeah i think if i can jump in as and

497
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,080
kdek the author has a comment um

498
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,039
now the

499
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,840
local attestation can be useful

500
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,640
uh

501
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,400
in many ways i think

502
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
there's still sort of a requirement that

503
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,360
the user trusts the crypto

504
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,080
that provides the attestation which is

505
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
probably the case but we don't have a

506
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,480
great way to require or reinforce

507
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,320
uh and i think dave really sort of hit

508
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,480
it on the nose this is not specific to

509
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,880
the t protocol this is just setting the

510
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,559
stage for

511
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,880
general concerns in the area of teas in

512
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,000
general

513
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
and

514
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,280
we are building a technology that is

515
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,080
useful in some cases and

516
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,120
it also may be

517
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,720
there are some cases where it could be

518
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,120
abused as well but because

519
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
there are

520
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,640
positive value use cases that we can

521
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,240
clearly describe we're going to go ahead

522
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,200
and do it and so we know their potential

523
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,600
for abuse but

524
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,679
we're not going to

525
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,280
have that block the entire work that's

526
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,720
the the main goal i appreciate this

527
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,240
but i do want to receive one of the

528
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,080
comments like your comment brendan go

529
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,440
ahead and finish but i do have an answer

530
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,360
that's more than just what ben said but

531
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
go ahead it strikes me that we need to

532
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
take the big picture of you as well i

533
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,039
mean this is an obvious problem

534
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,039
and so we should address it and even if

535
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,240
that comes down to a security

536
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,480
considerations comment at least pointing

537
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,320
the way to a solution seems like a good

538
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,159
idea

539
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,760
so the comment that i was going to make

540
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,440
is that

541
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,840
especially since teep has some use cases

542
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,679
where you can have confidential code and

543
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,600
so when we talk about personalization

544
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,960
data we said the personalization did it

545
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
could even include code and we have some

546
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
text about that in various places as to

547
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,559
how you could enable that what that

548
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,240
means is that um

549
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,280
the

550
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,039
end user meaning like the ree

551
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,480
administrator or the human sitting in

552
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,159
front of you know the the device whether

553
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,240
it's a gaming console or or whatever it

554
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,960
is that has a te in it um you may not

555
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,080
know

556
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,280
what the software is that's running

557
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,120
inside there so you can have attestation

558
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,480
that attends your point you know local

559
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,080
attestation that's your point brendan

560
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,360
and so you can get a hash that says

561
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,400
here's what's running but you don't have

562
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
a way to tie that to

563
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,159
what you know that that code is doing

564
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,360
right because the whole point is to keep

565
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,200
that code secret from you so you can't

566
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,120
actually vet it yourself right only the

567
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
tee administrator can vet that code you

568
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,960
the end user may not have access to that

569
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,159
you don't know what's running inside of

570
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,320
your gaming console that's drn protected

571
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,919
for example right so you don't have

572
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,000
necessarily a way to say how do i get

573
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
faith if that code is running and doing

574
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,799
what i think it's doing because you may

575
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,000
not be allowed to know what it's doing

576
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,240
right you just have to say i'm choosing

577
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
to buy the gaming console in the first

578
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,679
place and it's going to do some stuff

579
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,520
and but that's that's the

580
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,120
the business model that i'm opting into

581
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
there and so to answer your point i

582
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,640
think what you're talking about is

583
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,280
possible in some cases but in general

584
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
t-pass cases where that would not apply

585
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,880
so i don't want to derail this too much

586
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,280
more but i i guess the the point i i

587
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,600
want to make is that that strikes me as

588
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,760
an exception not a rule

589
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,159
i would argue that the more salient

590
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,480
point for me personally at least would

591
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,120
be that i want to know that my banking

592
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,360
app hasn't had its tam compromised and

593
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,640
shipped me a trojan instead of the tee

594
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
or the ta that's supposed to be

595
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,880
delivered by my bank so what i'd really

596
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,840
like to know is whether i can verify

597
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,159
that yes indeed the thing that it has

598
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,039
been shipped to me by the bank's tam is

599
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,799
actually the ta that they've got

600
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,880
published on their website somewhere so

601
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,279
they have a mechanism to verify it

602
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,159
locally on my system as well as via the

603
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,400
town you know it's a it's a defense

604
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,720
in-depth question and if you don't if

605
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
you have the capability to do that but

606
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,600
aren't describing it i'm i'm kind of at

607
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
a loss

608
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,919
so i think you're talking about your

609
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:28,960
suggestion that there could be an

610
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,240
additional text written into here

611
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,840
because i think there's a i think you're

612
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,520
addressing uh something that should be

613
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,360
mentioned in the privacy consideration

614
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,520
section and so i think your comment

615
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,360
would apply i'm interpreting it as

616
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,640
saying you're arguing that we should add

617
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,000
another sentence to the text that's on

618
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,480
the screen

619
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
yes okay if you would uh

620
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
if you would like to help us suggest

621
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,880
such a tax you know

622
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,400
suggestions gratefully accepted i think

623
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,720
would be my quick response okay thank

624
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,480
you

625
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,080
uh the only other comment i would make

626
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,960
was on uh privacy considerations too

627
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,919
arguing that the the end

628
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
arguing that the local user is not the

629
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,640
end user sounds to me like an attempt to

630
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,679
escape from the uh relevant rfc about

631
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,919
the internet is for end users frankly

632
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,600
the end user is the person holding the

633
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
device

634
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,960
it is not arguing that the person

635
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,400
holding it is not an end user it's

636
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,159
arguing that there are two end users

637
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,840
right one is local one is remote in

638
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,960
other words

639
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,200
massive end user not to remove the first

640
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,600
one so administrators are not end users

641
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,400
um

642
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,520
there are people who i think

643
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,679
particularly people who exert control

644
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,240
over end users

645
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,320
uh in some cases yes in some cases they

646
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,240
are end users

647
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
i i don't um well you know i i guess

648
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,240
that's a question that the group needs

649
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,679
to discuss but i'm going to disagree

650
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,279
with you on that so that's okay it

651
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,120
sounds like in your view in your

652
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,640
interpretation there are some devices

653
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,760
that have no end user

654
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,520
all right i would if

655
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,919
i'm an iot sensor in a place that humans

656
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,200
can't reach you're saying there is no

657
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,799
end user in that case right the internet

658
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,559
would argue that

659
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,320
any time that one user exercises control

660
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
over another user

661
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,960
the user being controlled is the end

662
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,960
user

663
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,440
so i don't like the that the way this is

664
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,679
described absolutely

665
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,760
the responsibility for protecting those

666
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
users

667
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,799
you will notice that there is no that

668
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,559
the word end is not anywhere in this

669
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,440
text

670
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
yep

671
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,640
you said end user and this text does not

672
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,159
actually disagree with you because it

673
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,919
doesn't use the term end user

674
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,799
right

675
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,400
remote user but never end user

676
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,240
i'm arguing that where there is a remote

677
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,320
user who is an administrator and there

678
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,880
is a local user who is not the local

679
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,360
user is the end user that's the point

680
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,720
i'm making

681
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,240
i get your point i don't think that

682
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,159
changes any text on the slide because nu

683
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,600
doesn't say make any comments about end

684
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,520
users so it's not there's nothing i

685
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,799
think that's actually in contradiction

686
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,880
to what your what your view is here

687
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,039
if i could make a suggestion because uh

688
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,960
taking up time yeah we're gonna go out

689
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,600
at times yeah if if you can take it to

690
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,640
the list or brennan and dave

691
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
uh brendan if you have suggestions on

692
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
how to update the text that might help

693
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,279
but it seems like

694
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,440
there may be some discord there yeah

695
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,840
yeah the document is currently in ietf's

696
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,600
last call since ben did initiate that

697
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
and so any comments we can take in as

698
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,880
part of ietf last call and if there's

699
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,559
wording suggestions that's normal

700
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,919
hearing ids last call things are going

701
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,679
to come up so

702
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,640
all right so i'm going to keep going

703
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,000
okay nancy

704
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,080
yeah i mean you're kind of out of time

705
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,360
on this one but um it is what it is so

706
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,760
let's let's keep moving

707
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,200
this one is probably the most important

708
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,360
document just because it's the context

709
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,559
for everything else

710
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,760
that's why i'm saying we should just

711
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,520
keep going on this one

712
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,919
okay so this one was actually uh the

713
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,840
other main comment where uh ben

714
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,679
originally posted this and the comments

715
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,080
on the transport document but actually

716
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,799
it applies to uh all the documents and

717
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,399
so really the architecture documents

718
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,760
that is the one that it really applies

719
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,559
to as being the context one okay and so

720
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,640
this one is talking about a denial of

721
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,559
service where the ree can conduct a

722
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,520
denial of service attack against um

723
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,200
against the t protocol

724
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,159
and so

725
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,399
uh

726
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,559
a compromised area can cause a to not

727
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,399
receive policy changes and must be out

728
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,480
of date with respect to policy

729
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,880
uh and so i think this is the text that

730
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,080
we did in to respond to this notion of

731
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,240
dos attacks right so we point out

732
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,159
uh that you can cause a t to not receive

733
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,080
policy changes you can cause the t to be

734
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,240
out of date with respect to policy

735
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,679
mention that the way to address that is

736
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,240
by using attestation so you can reject

737
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,520
things that are out of compliance from

738
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,600
being able to do whatever

739
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,480
you shouldn't be able to do when you're

740
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,200
out of compliance uh

741
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
and then the point about t brokers a t

742
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
broker can make suggestions but it can

743
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,360
never decide or enforce what runs there

744
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,120
so in other words there's no real

745
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
elevation of privilege per se that if

746
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,880
you can compromise say a broker running

747
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,399
the re you can't compromise the t

748
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,919
protocol

749
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,919
and then the last piece of text is that

750
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,240
uh if you can compromise

751
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,399
the rich execution environment then one

752
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,320
thing you could do for example is to

753
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,399
remove a valid dependency from an

754
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,240
untrusted application on a ta so in

755
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
other words you've got some application

756
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,799
running the te that depends on a tea

757
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,640
if you can compromise the ree you could

758
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
say hey that untrusted application no

759
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
longer needs your ta okay to clean it up

760
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,159
okay but errol there you're not really

761
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,559
harming the perspe per say you're hiring

762
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,799
the untrusted application and so the

763
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,480
mitigations there is just normal

764
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
security mechanisms in the rich

765
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,159
execution environment

766
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,480
and so hopefully this addresses all

767
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,760
those things but this was not in the

768
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
protocol say we put this in the in the

769
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,279
architecture document

770
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,360
okay

771
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,640
unless i see somebody in the queue and a

772
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,720
trial to finish up this document here

773
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,200
uh ben also raised the question on the

774
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,520
text about uh in the security

775
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,760
considerations about validating hbs

776
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,799
certs

777
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,279
uh and so we asked might ocsp or some

778
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,279
other crl mechanism via scope should we

779
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,279
mention these other rfcs

780
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,360
and so uh currently we went back to the

781
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
ietf 111 discussion and you can see the

782
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,880
quotes in the minutes there from russ

783
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,559
and ben that's where we agreed to not

784
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,120
reference ocsp in the t protocol

785
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,520
although there the context was about

786
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,360
end-to-end ocsp

787
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,919
and not necessarily about the

788
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,679
hbs certificate but about their

789
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,039
certificates in the teep itself right

790
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,600
but uh extending from that um we said

791
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,440
since it's uh it would be nice to not

792
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,640
have to put another protocol under there

793
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,559
but i'm open to suggestions on this one

794
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,200
so what we did do is uh and we still

795
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,760
left the reference just 52.80 but we had

796
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,520
the phrase but certificate status check

797
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,960
protocols may not scale down to

798
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
constrained devices that use t

799
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,480
but this is why we do end-to-end um

800
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,640
keying inside peak protocol even if it's

801
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,200
inside https right so https just goes to

802
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,840
the ree in general and so even if you

803
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,039
can compromise that you haven't

804
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,399
compromised the t protocol because

805
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,480
there's another encrypted session inside

806
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,679
the https section so

807
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,240
it sounded like ben

808
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,840
took this and put it up for atf last

809
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,960
call so i'm going to keep going we just

810
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,799
want to raise the visibility if people

811
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,320
think that is important please let us

812
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,559
know during this ietf last call period

813
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,240
but right now all we've done is we've

814
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,080
kept the reference to 5280 but not

815
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,720
required ocsp or anything for hps

816
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,799
um just allow it to scale down so

817
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,640
um i

818
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,679
think this is the yeah this is the the

819
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,000
last main slide on this one um there

820
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,159
were three different bundling examples

821
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,480
between um you have an untrusted app a

822
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,840
trusted app and some personalization

823
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,600
data and how do you package those three

824
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,960
for distribution

825
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,799
we have three cases that the document

826
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,559
mentioned the first case is all three of

827
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,159
them right the brackets say those two

828
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,679
are packaged together and distributed

829
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,840
via one protocol the other bracketed

830
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,039
sections distributed save you a

831
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,039
different protocol or mechanism and so

832
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,480
we had three of those and then pointed

833
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,919
out well there's other ways to combine

834
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,000
those uh why did you not mention those

835
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,919
and so that's what four and five are we

836
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,240
gonna go for completeness we put in some

837
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,799
text about you know why they may be less

838
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,480
applicable in some cases and so we

839
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,799
updated the list as well as we updated

840
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,640
the description of sgx the discussion

841
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,919
trust zone

842
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,240
so it mentions which of all five of them

843
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,600
instead of which all three of them are

844
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,440
most applicable to sgx which ones are

845
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,039
applicable to trust zone

846
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,480
but those are of course not intended to

847
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,159
be by way of limitation those are just

848
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,200
examples

849
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
so how will they apply to say you know

850
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,000
risk five as uh the japanese folks are

851
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,120
doing or for other intel or you know amd

852
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,399
or whatever else the intent is not to

853
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,000
cover all those just to pick two

854
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,440
examples that are sort of different

855
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,120
implementations and say how teeth would

856
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,880
be applicable or which parts of tape

857
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,320
replica so

858
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,279
that was i think just editorial um but

859
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,880
it was important because there may be

860
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,480
cases where people actually want four

861
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,919
and five so

862
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,679
um but it's maybe difficult in certain

863
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,600
implementations of these

864
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,559
all right

865
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,399
last slide on architecture before we

866
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,960
move on um is just a couple of uh

867
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,240
bullets here

868
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,480
um there was a question about what's the

869
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,080
difference between protect process

870
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,159
connect versus process t message in the

871
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,559
abstract apis why were there two

872
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,240
and the answer was it's purely an

873
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
editorial distinction to help um

874
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,559
understand things where process connect

875
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,120
is a request to request a new session

876
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,519
and process cheat message is a

877
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,960
processing message in an existing

878
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,840
session

879
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,919
so since they're abstract apis you can

880
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,679
always implement them as combined or

881
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,279
have split processed messages in

882
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,200
multiple ones whatever it is this was

883
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,960
just a convenient way to describe things

884
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,840
that

885
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,360
to keep the concepts of new session

886
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,760
versus existing session different

887
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,000
uh there was a comment about use of the

888
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,080
same key for both signing and encryption

889
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,480
where ben's point was that uh using the

890
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
same key for both of those

891
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,120
is an academic uh open question as to

892
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,720
whether that weakens things or not and

893
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
so we put that point into text and

894
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,600
basically use ben's wording

895
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,440
in two different places um

896
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,200
one for the te pair and one for the tam

897
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,440
pair the same wording was in there

898
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,119
and then ben suggested various other

899
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,639
editorial nets that were just accepted

900
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,480
as proposed so

901
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,440
all right so that's it on the

902
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,800
architecture document any other

903
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
questions before we go on nancy i think

904
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,280
transport is up next right yeah um

905
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,918
transports next so i i would say if

906
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,679
there any other questions to take it to

907
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,599
the list just because then i'm going to

908
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,199
switch this we're running out of time

909
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,000
yeah

910
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,480
yeah or short on time i should say

911
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,040
transport deck not that one

912
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,199
is this one this one is short

913
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,439
okay

914
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,440
let's call

915
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,000
uh and so you can see the timeline there

916
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,480
so same thing is now that the protocol

917
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,239
spec is stable enough that we don't

918
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,440
think that there's major changes to

919
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,560
transport

920
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,599
we don't think there's any changes

921
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,920
transported than editorial ones um so

922
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,480
we'll go ahead and submitting that

923
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,359
uh

924
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,520
the main comment on this one was the dos

925
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,800
that was possible by the re as i

926
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,839
mentioned that one was addressed in the

927
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,000
architecture document the only change in

928
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
transport was we added the sentence to c

929
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,520
section on the architecture document for

930
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,280
security considerations specific to the

931
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,320
use of t

932
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,920
we didn't actually have that in the uh

933
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,599
in the uh transport track before we

934
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,280
referenced other things

935
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,079
um like you know things around https uh

936
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,359
security and so on but we didn't

937
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,040
reference the deep architecture document

938
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,320
so we had that

939
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,839
because everything else is addressed in

940
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,839
the air dock

941
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,920
the main topics on the transport spec

942
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,800
were uh comments about the http

943
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
references and then a couple minor

944
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,960
points about the actual logic so for

945
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,400
references

946
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,680
um

947
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,640
we replaced rfc 6125 with an internet

948
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,400
draft reference because that draft is

949
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,079
already in the rfc editor's queue

950
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,520
meaning it's going to beat us anyway so

951
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,280
we just update the reference

952
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,079
there's two other documents actually

953
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,839
75 75 25 and another version 6125 they

954
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,480
have active disk documents in uta

955
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,400
but they are only drafts and so right

956
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,079
now it looks like they'll be lagging us

957
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,040
and so

958
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,720
uh we could pull them in later if they

959
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,320
happen to hit if they happen to go into

960
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
rfc editor queue but right now

961
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
we are just referencing the the posted

962
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,720
internet posted rfc so we don't have

963
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,598
down level references

964
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
and the notable feedback

965
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,520
uh there was uh text in there that had

966
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,079
been uh obsoleted by later t protocol

967
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,400
spec ones which was uh long ago we had

968
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,920
more than one media type when we

969
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,560
supported both json and cbor now that we

970
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,160
only have cbor there is only one media

971
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,079
type and so we could remove text that

972
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,200
implied that there could be more than

973
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,280
one so that removes several sentences

974
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,119
there's a logic point that says if you

975
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,280
ever receive if the if the tam ever

976
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
receives their own content type

977
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,800
that you should treat that as an error

978
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,520
and of course bcp 56 bis the how to use

979
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,920
thp as a transport doesn't require this

980
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,359
and so ben said let's make sure the

981
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,640
working group is okay with us being a

982
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,520
should

983
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,680
uh and so we left that since we already

984
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,200
passed working group last call as it

985
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,000
should

986
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,560
and the belief is that having the tam

987
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,480
treat that is in the error

988
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,320
actually prevents bugs and encourages

989
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,160
more protocol interoperability but of

990
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,440
course it's not a must it's just a

991
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,599
should so we left as i should because

992
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,800
we didn't want to have to revisit

993
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,599
working your best call

994
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
the unrequest ta this is how you choose

995
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,640
which tam to send i'm done with this ta

996
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,040
now all of my re applications on my

997
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,720
untrusted apps that depend on it are now

998
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,520
gone

999
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,359
um the tam uri was not one of the

1000
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,200
parameters to the abstract api in the

1001
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,040
pro in the transport spec and so we had

1002
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,640
to update that for consistencies and

1003
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
then all the specs match

1004
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,000
and then again ben suggested some word

1005
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,599
smith thing that was uh just accepted

1006
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,440
because they were just editorialized so

1007
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,920
that's it for transport

1008
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,040
all right nancy i think unless there's

1009
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,320
any questions teammate so back to you

1010
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,400
i don't remember um

1011
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
dave i think you said i don't know if i

1012
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,960
saw the changes on the uh

1013
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,720
transport spec

1014
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,680
but ben was good with all the comments

1015
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,440
yeah he put him up well for best call

1016
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,720
dan you're welcome to speak up but he

1017
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,760
said they both look good to me and you

1018
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
put them up for iuts let's go excellent

1019
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,599
thanks ben

1020
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,359
yeah i remember seeing

1021
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,599
last call and the last call got extended

1022
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,359
a week because it overlaps the itf

1023
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,240
meeting

1024
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,919
but uh i was happy with everything

1025
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
yeah we could barely hear you ben if you

1026
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,200
can repeat

1027
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,520
sorry uh yeah dave's right i put them

1028
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,599
out for last call because i was happy

1029
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,440
with all the changes yeah

1030
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,359
thanks for that extended a week because

1031
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,240
it overlaps with the itf meeting

1032
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,520
okay

1033
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,960
appreciate it

1034
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,200
yeah for some reason i missed the uh

1035
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,760
transport one but i did see your

1036
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,000
call for uh

1037
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,079
for the architecture one

1038
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,000
okay so up next um akira

1039
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,880
yes

1040
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,760
can you share your slides or do you want

1041
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,359
me to ah

1042
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,240
it's coming yeah just

1043
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,200
what

1044
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,960
okay

1045
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,720
is my mic working

1046
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,839
yes we can hear you okay

1047
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,560
i forgot how to flip the oh there it is

1048
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,400
yes

1049
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,839
so we we

1050
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,240
had a um hackathon

1051
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,000
in japan team so i in this slide i was a

1052
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,560
little bit hurry so i didn't list up all

1053
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
the people but usual

1054
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,680
um from second iso

1055
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,040
and

1056
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,480
it and

1057
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,400
and also tragio is uh

1058
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,440
and

1059
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,960
in in in zuzak sign i think it was in me

1060
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,480
and i think that's all

1061
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,240
and obviously was

1062
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,760
um go through the implementation for the

1063
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,880
um what was added from the last ietf and

1064
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,520
the first one was suit but the other one

1065
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,240
added to the draft is eat and courses

1066
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,119
which is a significant

1067
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,720
um updates

1068
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,599
so that's going through uh

1069
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,839
and

1070
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,200
finding any point to

1071
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,200
yeah revise or update on the draft

1072
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,359
and this is the

1073
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,400
two to eat model or at the station model

1074
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,560
i saw it frequently in dave's slide and

1075
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,319
not 2019.

1076
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,280
so one is passport model and one is back

1077
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,480
background check model

1078
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,720
and

1079
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,079
in in the in the current t protocol

1080
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,880
draft it's supporting

1081
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,920
us

1082
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,960
um assuming it's honestly it's identical

1083
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,359
as a background check model

1084
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,520
and

1085
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,280
yeah we thought about

1086
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,839
should

1087
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,400
we um what should we go only for a

1088
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,079
background check model

1089
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,440
and

1090
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,319
for in our implementation

1091
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,200
it's

1092
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,480
it's a

1093
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,760
handling talking with the verifier

1094
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,040
from the directly from the device

1095
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,960
is a bit more

1096
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,520
overhead for the constraint device so

1097
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
tam doing

1098
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,000
on their side

1099
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,720
instead of the device side is uh yes

1100
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,000
it's um it's nice for the implementation

1101
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,920
friendly for the device

1102
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,359
so um

1103
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,000
in the however it might be okay to make

1104
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,839
way the discussion was it might be okay

1105
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,000
to make the draft a little bit more

1106
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,200
generic

1107
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,599
so in the future some of the device

1108
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,440
which is able to

1109
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,440
talk with the verifier directly and

1110
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,560
able to do the passport model

1111
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,440
um

1112
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,839
yeah

1113
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,560
so

1114
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,280
yeah the in the in the well

1115
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,760
at this time we really didn't have much

1116
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,200
uh idea what to do to make it generic so

1117
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,160
one one of the idea was just having the

1118
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,760
attestation

1119
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,240
result or evidence

1120
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,720
um format in the eat

1121
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,200
profile is able to display english

1122
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
whether it's

1123
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,800
receiving attestation result or evidence

1124
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,560
yes but um yeah

1125
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,240
and the next is about

1126
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:03,040
um c4 format and cbor and json so ee is

1127
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,079
going to have json and cbor format

1128
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,160
supporting both

1129
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,119
and

1130
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,760
the currently

1131
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,480
[Music]

1132
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,839
places to describe so evidence format

1133
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,359
and one another one is evidence

1134
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,880
and

1135
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,240
honestly in the implementation

1136
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,200
whether

1137
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,160
evidence format is js is going to say

1138
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,040
it's a

1139
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,280
json or c4 evidence in the both json or

1140
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,520
cbo and b string will work

1141
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,680
yeah it does work

1142
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,240
but however the discussion was making

1143
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,400
evidence to have both b string or t text

1144
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,960
will have both type

1145
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,839
and

1146
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,760
able to displaying is whether it's

1147
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,280
evidence going to have a b string or

1148
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,319
text is

1149
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,280
from the evidence format it might be

1150
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,720
more um

1151
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,920
friendly

1152
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,240
uh easier to understand

1153
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,520
so um

1154
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,400
evidence format having

1155
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,520
indication of the json or um cyborg or

1156
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,599
alternatively was uh and the transport

1157
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,079
layer has a um

1158
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,319
type saying application jwt or

1159
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,520
application cwt

1160
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,960
sorry akira hannes is up on the q he

1161
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,200
might have a comment yeah okay hi hi

1162
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,920
akira um that's honest here

1163
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,200
i wonder whether we should just say uh

1164
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,240
that the eat is in in uh in sibo format

1165
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,640
rather than leaving out leaving the

1166
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,240
options possible for having both

1167
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,240
encodings like we made at some point in

1168
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,640
time the decision that the deep protocol

1169
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,040
is also only encoded in one format and i

1170
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,640
think that's

1171
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,200
easier to do i don't think we should

1172
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,040
support all sorts of different formats

1173
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
just because it's possible

1174
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,720
i think we should make our life easier

1175
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,959
dave

1176
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,119
dave did you have a comment you're in

1177
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,119
the queue yeah

1178
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,760
yep just finding my mute button um

1179
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,440
so the

1180
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,040
teep protocol

1181
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,240
itself uh just carries

1182
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,599
um

1183
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,000
eats as opaque dated right it doesn't

1184
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,280
actually care right there's nothing in

1185
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,880
the teep implementation itself that

1186
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,640
carries about this because like in the

1187
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,240
background check model all you do is you

1188
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,560
take the blob and you forward it on to a

1189
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,640
a verifier right so there's no hard

1190
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,240
dependency here so uh that's why i i

1191
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,160
don't think it's you it's necessary to

1192
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,760
do any hard restrictions it's because

1193
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,280
it's just a payload think of this as

1194
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,800
like a transport for a higher level

1195
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,079
protocol you need some end to end

1196
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,240
agreement or whatever sure but the t

1197
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,560
protocol itself doesn't actually care

1198
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,520
when you're doing a constrained

1199
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,040
implementation i agree with hanus but

1200
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,319
there's no reason that cheap protocol

1201
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,680
should be constrained to that that i

1202
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,160
know of right now i mean i'm open to it

1203
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,599
but i think what i originally got in the

1204
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,960
queue to say was that for media types

1205
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,000
i think that uh application jwt and

1206
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
application cwp are too generic they

1207
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,200
don't mean that they're eat it just

1208
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,240
means that that's a jwt or cwt and so

1209
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,680
often in media types you have more

1210
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,599
specific media types

1211
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,000
than just the generic ones and so here i

1212
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,280
think there's an argument that says the

1213
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,200
rats working group should have i should

1214
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,960
define eat specific i don't know

1215
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,480
remember it already does i just can't

1216
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,599
remember if it does if i've seen that

1217
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,160
any place it should have um eat specific

1218
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,400
media types for jwt and ccop rather than

1219
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,920
the than the suggestion ones there there

1220
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,200
should just be more specific ones you

1221
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,440
know uh you know application slash eat

1222
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,680
plus jwt something like that um that

1223
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,599
gives you a more constrained media type

1224
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,200
is kind of the media type guidance but

1225
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,480
otherwise that was my god so thanks

1226
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,400
yeah

1227
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,640
thanks um

1228
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,480
okay yeah we will

1229
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,680
yes

1230
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,319
well we could um keep keep discussing

1231
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,599
and update the

1232
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,359
protocol about it

1233
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,598
and

1234
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,440
and the other thing is

1235
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,920
yes this is was the most of the

1236
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,480
discussion we had

1237
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,400
um

1238
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,559
yes we decided to have

1239
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,280
used corsair for the um

1240
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,040
signature and um organism for the

1241
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,559
seaboard

1242
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,520
the same way as a slip handling

1243
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,400
because soothes handling corset and

1244
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
and if if we

1245
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,280
decided to use different way other than

1246
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,920
seat or eat

1247
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,079
for the teep then they are implementing

1248
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,520
for different uh yeah implementation

1249
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,680
will be difficult i mean it's not

1250
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,680
difficult but it's more

1251
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,160
time consuming and more overhead for

1252
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,680
debugging

1253
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,078
so um

1254
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,680
so we would like to have uh

1255
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,440
we would like to use we're going to use

1256
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,880
cose and also the supported cipher suit

1257
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,200
which is required which is recommended

1258
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,640
which is optional is will be um

1259
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,079
not far away from suit and eat

1260
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:22,880
and

1261
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,680
the easiest one came up as going to be

1262
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,520
required to implement and for the

1263
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,319
implement implementation is uh

1264
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,680
have

1265
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,160
shot 256.

1266
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,040
because that's already required in suit

1267
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,040
and

1268
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,839
in the on the device side required to

1269
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,680
implement either of one is es 256 or

1270
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,440
eddsa

1271
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,920
and device side implementing either of

1272
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,880
one is probably okay for the time side

1273
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,839
it might require it might be better to

1274
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,000
write it here the

1275
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,160
good to have a better

1276
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,480
mandatory to implement both

1277
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,520
and inc

1278
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,760
recommended implementation

1279
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,200
yes this is what

1280
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,520
uh hannah's have been

1281
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,599
talked in the past and

1282
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,880
having hss lms for quantum resistance

1283
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,880
purpose

1284
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,839
and

1285
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,720
other one pretty much

1286
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,079
typically used rsa aes symmetric ga is

1287
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:30,960
and

1288
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,200
and rsa is still

1289
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,839
widely used in many places

1290
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,960
and also other the other one is um even

1291
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,119
the aes is the aes

1292
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,920
accm and and some of the industry domain

1293
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,960
is the shifting from ccm to gcm so i

1294
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,839
yeah

1295
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,920
i thought it would be nice to have put

1296
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,760
it in in the optional list

1297
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,000
and uh so far i i couldn't find the shot

1298
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,319
three in the yana registration but the

1299
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,880
pro if if that is going in then probably

1300
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,280
could be good to have in the optional

1301
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,280
list

1302
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,839
and

1303
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,559
yeah this is a i'm this is something i i

1304
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:19,839
wasn't

1305
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,880
nobody in the japan side knew what to do

1306
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,480
so when we use

1307
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,960
going to use rsa

1308
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,640
specifying key length is very important

1309
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,280
10 24 is a little too weak

1310
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,040
and probably mostly it's recommended to

1311
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,920
have

1312
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,079
over 20 48 and many of them now i have

1313
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,160
is using 40

1314
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,480
yeah 40 96 so um

1315
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,960
how yeah we would like to have a how to

1316
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,319
specify

1317
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,440
key length of the rsa and i wasn't with

1318
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,599
i wasn't in the um

1319
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,200
export in this

1320
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,680
um iana was experiencing corsair format

1321
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,240
so um i i really would like to have a

1322
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,319
help on this

1323
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,160
okay you've got harness coming up on the

1324
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,079
cue akira um okay akira you um

1325
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,839
do we need rsa

1326
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,400
actually

1327
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,599
um

1328
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,000
well

1329
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,479
it's a

1330
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,640
well it's still

1331
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,760
i'm

1332
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,359
my my point of view is have

1333
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,480
make it generic as possible so

1334
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,640
many of the

1335
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,720
or many of the company or many of the

1336
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,800
entity will use teeth as much as

1337
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,079
possible so i'm i'm not saying i'm not

1338
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,839
i'm not saying we should

1339
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,880
or it's good to have rsa or not

1340
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
but it it doesn't i thought it won't

1341
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,599
hurt just having in the optional list

1342
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,920
okay optionally yeah

1343
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,079
because i i

1344
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,920
i don't see

1345
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,800
requests for rsa these days uh at least

1346
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,359
in in my environment anymore and so so

1347
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,119
i'm curious like he's actually still

1348
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,040
someone asking for it

1349
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,520
oh no it's not nobody is asking for it

1350
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,119
just so the most most important is in

1351
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,079
the page six six and the size the left

1352
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,920
side required

1353
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,359
and recommended

1354
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:24,480
list

1355
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,480
and the right side is all optional so um

1356
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,119
yeah it's optional so people will freak

1357
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,359
out if it's aes is not in the list or

1358
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:39,960
512 is not in the list

1359
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,319
okay

1360
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,400
and also i think this topic is going to

1361
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,760
be in the davis

1362
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,839
slide too so we could continue talking

1363
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,190
about this

1364
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,329
[Music]

1365
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,800
was that your last slide akira i thought

1366
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,319
you had one more

1367
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,319
yeah yeah i think yeah that's great and

1368
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,319
one thing i could i would like to

1369
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,520
mention as i'm getting a um permission

1370
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,280
is

1371
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,000
the implementation for the tip is going

1372
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,119
to be

1373
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,160
publicly available as open source

1374
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,240
before the next idf 114

1375
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,599
yes um engineering side technical side

1376
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,800
is mostly complete not on not you know

1377
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,319
from a while ago

1378
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,040
um only thing pending is other ministers

1379
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,280
and administrating point

1380
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,319
yes

1381
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,559
that's great akira so it would be great

1382
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,960
if you posted the i'm presuming it would

1383
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,400
be on git and github

1384
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,559
if you can post it to the mail list that

1385
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,079
would be awesome

1386
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,520
yes yeah

1387
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,599
yes so our plan from few

1388
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,720
you have been planning was having a both

1389
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,800
hosting of the github and also having a

1390
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,599
docker image so preparing the build

1391
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,040
environment is easier

1392
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,839
that's great

1393
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,040
yeah

1394
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,079
all right

1395
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,520
thank you akira

1396
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,440
thank you

1397
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,800
dave i think you're back on

1398
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,880
okay

1399
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,160
waiting for the screen share request

1400
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,000
yeah

1401
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,839
i'm i'm not able to

1402
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,480
oh that's weird okay there it goes there

1403
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,400
were there were two of you there and i

1404
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,839
just had to find the right one to give

1405
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,240
you the uh

1406
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,119
yeah

1407
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,599
okay you've got it now

1408
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,599
interesting it's it's unlike the

1409
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,960
previous time this time it's asking me

1410
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,240
to choose a deck to share rather than

1411
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,839
sharing my own screen

1412
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,520
uh maybe i click the wrong button so i'm

1413
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,240
gonna dismiss this and ask again so

1414
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,760
yeah

1415
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,720
well i was afraid to revoke one

1416
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,839
and the other so i just gave it to you

1417
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,960
once okay you should have just got

1418
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,599
another request

1419
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,240
yeah i see it

1420
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,640
um it's still okay it's still going to

1421
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,160
do a remote one so that's okay i'll do

1422
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,839
it this way but it's not asking not a

1423
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,400
lot of share screens

1424
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,920
it gave me the drop down from the uh

1425
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,440
from the uploaded slides so i'll just do

1426
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,880
it this way that's just fine this is no

1427
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,799
changes so i just got to get used to

1428
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,400
this interface so

1429
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,319
okay so now we're under the t protocol

1430
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:33,520
spec

1431
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,839
and so um

1432
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,920
a curious presentation will also affect

1433
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,920
the protocol uh things too and so one of

1434
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,200
those points is kara mentioned we'll

1435
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,359
come back to you so i got this organized

1436
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,839
in terms of general stuff then the suit

1437
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,400
related section and then the uh rats

1438
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,920
related section at the end that order so

1439
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,559
okay so first um the document has been

1440
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,319
updated with things that we already

1441
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,799
agreed at ietf 112 so just to refresh

1442
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,000
your memory i'm not going to go through

1443
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,680
these in detail because they're in the

1444
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,559
minutes and we just tried to do exactly

1445
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,400
what we got consensus on and confirmed

1446
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,400
on the list back at 112.

1447
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,880
and so you can see uh 40 had to do with

1448
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,359
an efficiency

1449
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,599
change of being able to reuse stuff as

1450
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,359
long as all these constraints are true

1451
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,280
we went through that at 2012

1452
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,599
and then we updated the clarifications

1453
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,040
when is the token included in the update

1454
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,640
message so if there's questions feel

1455
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,079
free but since we discussed that last

1456
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,000
time just letting you know that those

1457
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,359
the first changes is stuff that we

1458
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,880
already agreed there

1459
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,440
this is the continuation

1460
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,599
we said that they were going to be suit

1461
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:36,720
manifests

1462
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,839
and cure presented at 112

1463
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,760
the different examples there and so we

1464
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,839
took the details of the presentation at

1465
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,760
112 we went through there and put those

1466
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,000
into uh things in the spec

1467
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,240
uh that i think if i remember right

1468
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,960
akira had posted this per request um but

1469
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,799
it wasn't merged part of the id deadline

1470
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,559
before and then we presented it at 112

1471
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:57,920
and so you've all seen it and all the

1472
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,359
stuff that accurate presented has merged

1473
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,520
so

1474
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,359
all right

1475
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,799
so now we're going to go into suit

1476
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,880
specific stuff that is uh more than just

1477
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,559
what we talked about at 112 things that

1478
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,240
have come up in discussion or

1479
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,000
implementation or that was listed as

1480
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,520
open issues before because our goal is

1481
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,839
to be at zero open issues and so we're

1482
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,359
at least at uh zero that were filed

1483
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,960
before so

1484
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,160
all right

1485
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,559
um so back at ietf 111 meaning two ietf

1486
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,000
meetings ago brennan had a great

1487
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,319
presentation about examples not of

1488
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,240
manifest but of suit reports right and

1489
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,480
so here's an example in the bottom right

1490
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,599
of one of brennan's slides from 111 and

1491
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,760
so there's now an appendix that takes

1492
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,920
the content of those slides put those in

1493
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,960
appendix's example suit reports um there

1494
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,960
is a request for me to brendan to say

1495
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,480
hey can you please check that because

1496
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,400
i'm not sure i got the text right that

1497
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,480
goes with it and i want it to be as

1498
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,319
close as possible the way that bretton

1499
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,920
would have presented it and so just a

1500
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,520
request yeah i see brendan saying we'll

1501
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,760
do okay great um since these were your

1502
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,920
slides the point is to be as accurate as

1503
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,520
possible as to what your recommendation

1504
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,280
was there and this is just an appendix

1505
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,200
just because it's samples right it's not

1506
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,040
normative so all right

1507
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,480
everybody else from suit is welcome to

1508
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,319
review them too but uh i consider

1509
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,599
brendan the most authoritative because

1510
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,640
they're his examples so

1511
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,839
all right uh the next one that we had

1512
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,280
some discussion about but we didn't have

1513
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,720
proposed text before but we didn't

1514
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,040
discuss it last iatf

1515
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,839
was about removing and we started using

1516
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,240
the term unlinking a uh

1517
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,160
a trusted component

1518
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,760
and so uh here things that we did do is

1519
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,599
we added the suit manifest example that

1520
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,000
we walked through at 112 where that

1521
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,839
manifest example was a case where you

1522
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,599
were unlinking you know removing a ref

1523
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,599
count on a trust component

1524
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,839
uh that and that was done using the

1525
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,680
directive unlink to decrement the ref

1526
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,920
count right so we talked about that last

1527
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,680
time but there was no per request so we

1528
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,240
put that into the actual document then

1529
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,799
we left the details of how to do that to

1530
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,400
suit so in other words we didn't go

1531
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,760
through lots of things because that's

1532
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,000
really it's a normal suit manifest thing

1533
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,839
it's not really a teep specific thing so

1534
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,599
the details we said we're going to leave

1535
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,200
the details to suit documents and just

1536
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,599
cross reference them and we just had a

1537
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,119
suit manifest examples here's how you

1538
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,359
would apply that in a teak case

1539
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,119
but this did result in adding a

1540
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,920
reference to a newly adopted suit

1541
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,000
document which was sprit split out of

1542
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,760
the suit manifest

1543
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,440
in the suit working group

1544
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,359
we had in order to get the suit manifest

1545
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,440
document done as fast as possible then

1546
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,720
we took some of the things that were

1547
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,640
still being discussed split those in

1548
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,040
separate documents and so the suit trust

1549
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,200
domains is one part of that and so we

1550
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,880
then had to add a reference to the split

1551
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,880
out document which is now an official

1552
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,720
suit document that will be discussed in

1553
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,280
the suit meeting later this week so

1554
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,839
take people you know please come soon

1555
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,160
all right

1556
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,680
167 this is the one that akira was

1557
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,680
referring to about the cypher suite so

1558
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,359
this is um

1559
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,359
another view of that same slide that

1560
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,040
akira said that we'd come back to so if

1561
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,319
you have any other comments this is a

1562
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,920
slide to get up back at the mic line for

1563
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,960
us so

1564
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,839
um

1565
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,319
at 112 we said we were going to get rid

1566
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,960
of the teach specific stuff in terms of

1567
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,720
an eye on our registry and just use the

1568
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,559
cozy algorithms registry right for

1569
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,520
reasons that akira explains right and so

1570
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,680
what's here is a table that reflects

1571
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,000
what the text in the document says uh

1572
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,079
the table isn't in the document but it

1573
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,000
matches the logic in there i put it in

1574
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,680
the table form just for slide viewing

1575
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,480
here

1576
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,040
and so in the new teep spec there are

1577
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,880
signing algorithms encryption algorithms

1578
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,960
and mac algorithms and there's a list of

1579
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,880
possibilities in there

1580
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,040
and in the past we'd agreed that for the

1581
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,920
mandatory ones uh that both of them were

1582
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,680
on the look at the signing algorithm top

1583
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,960
two rows there

1584
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,040
they were both mandatory at the tam to

1585
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,520
allow the team agent to pick either one

1586
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,680
okay so that was the previous working

1587
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,240
group consensus that says uh there's two

1588
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,000
of them maybe one is more forward

1589
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,680
looking one is more practical right now

1590
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,960
but the point is

1591
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,520
the tam must do two of them and neither

1592
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,040
of them individually is mandatory for

1593
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,559
the teep agent you're just required to

1594
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,559
pick one or the other and since the tam

1595
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:07,599
supports both you'll always get

1596
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,040
interoperability

1597
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,480
all the other ones there are listed as

1598
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,480
maze and that's the stuff you guys were

1599
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,000
just talking about and honest you're

1600
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,480
asking do we really need rsa and so on

1601
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,280
those are all maze right now and so

1602
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,280
whether we list these or don't list maze

1603
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,640
because technically you could argue that

1604
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,839
everything that goes the algorithms

1605
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,319
registry is in may right um and so how

1606
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,920
many maze do we need to call out versus

1607
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,760
just saying everything else is in may i

1608
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,440
don't know this is what the document has

1609
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,880
right now because this is the least

1610
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,559
change from previous

1611
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:35,839
um and so if you think that we should

1612
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:38,400
remove maze or add maze no big deal we

1613
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,799
can do either one or leave it as is but

1614
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:43,359
the must on here at the top it's what uh

1615
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,040
we'd previously said just translated

1616
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,280
into cozy algorithms

1617
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,640
but since before did not make a

1618
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,400
distinction in the document before this

1619
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,400
version between encrypt algorithms and

1620
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,039
mac algorithms um you can see which ones

1621
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,359
are currently listed as must right now

1622
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:00,079
in the cosi algorithms and feedback

1623
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:02,400
welcome on whether that is the right set

1624
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,119
of musts so

1625
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,640
i will pause for a second just to make

1626
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,000
sure nobody's going to get up at the mic

1627
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,920
line but otherwise this is what the

1628
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,400
document says right now

1629
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,400
yeah i think you can keep moving

1630
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,640
okay

1631
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,640
uh all right

1632
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,359
uh so this uh cara was alluding to this

1633
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:24,160
the proposal from the suit 112 meeting

1634
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,960
okay

1635
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,839
um

1636
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,440
and i think russ was part of this

1637
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,480
discussion was that uh you know to say

1638
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,559
something like uh in the keep context

1639
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,680
must implement hss lms which is now rfc

1640
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,200
8778

1641
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,720
because it's quantum resistant and

1642
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,119
should implement ecdsa and may implement

1643
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,720
others right this is from the slide at

1644
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,359
ietf112 suit okay now what you'll notice

1645
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,280
is that hms lms is not on the previous

1646
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,720
slide

1647
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,520
okay

1648
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,119
and so the question for the working

1649
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,559
group is

1650
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,480
what do we do about that discussion as

1651
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,559
reflecting the previous slide and so for

1652
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,680
example you see should we for example

1653
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,839
add hss lms to the to the table and uh

1654
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,400
dropped es256 on the previous slide you

1655
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,839
can see

1656
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,880
uh es 256 is up here as a must for the

1657
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,920
tam

1658
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,000
and the t page you can choose that or ec

1659
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,559
dsa or edgsa

1660
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,039
and so do we drop that one do we add hss

1661
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,200
lms so this is what the editors want to

1662
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,119
know what should we do

1663
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,280
and if we change something over here

1664
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,119
what does it look like on the agent part

1665
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,799
of that slide so any direction from the

1666
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,079
working group is what they think the

1667
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,160
right thing is for hsslvs on this slide

1668
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,480
you've you've got russ on the queue and

1669
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,760
then

1670
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,559
honestly yeah yeah

1671
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,960
russ go ahead

1672
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,960
the argument we made was that for a

1673
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,640
firmware load

1674
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,640
you could amateurize

1675
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:05,520
the big signature there across a lot of

1676
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,359
software but here we're talking about a

1677
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:10,720
environment

1678
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,720
that could be quite small

1679
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,920
where the

1680
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,559
the update is not necessarily a full

1681
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,920
firmware load so um

1682
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,839
the other thing we were saying is this

1683
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,400
allows us to move to a post-quantum

1684
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,000
environment once we know what those

1685
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,440
algorithms are

1686
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,319
and

1687
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,880
once we do know what those are we could

1688
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,240
push that new algorithm here

1689
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,520
which is

1690
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,280
most likely going to have

1691
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,079
a more reasonable signature size anyway

1692
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,599
that was my thought

1693
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,839
don't change these for now is what i'm

1694
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,200
suggesting

1695
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,720
okay thank you for repeating because

1696
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,079
your audio wasn't great for your first

1697
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,079
sentence but the takeaway is uh leave

1698
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:55,000
the table as is for now as is i think

1699
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,359
that's what i heard go ahead honestly um

1700
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:58,720
yeah uh

1701
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,720
dave if you swipe um swap over to the

1702
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,119
next slide um

1703
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,680
i wasn't quite sure on

1704
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,640
could you go oh yeah so um is for the

1705
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,280
first proposal from idf uh suit meeting

1706
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,039
was that on

1707
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,880
the server side or on the client side

1708
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,640
uh russ is the best person to answer

1709
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,000
that since it was actually his proposal

1710
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,680
so

1711
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,799
okay

1712
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,799
but uh yeah

1713
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:28,400
whatever russ said made sense to me

1714
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,480
so i'm good with uh the suggestions made

1715
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,319
you're good with russes

1716
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,559
made you oh

1717
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,359
mink did you have a comment i i

1718
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,400
you were on the queue and then you left

1719
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,119
yeah i'm okay so i said i was asking

1720
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,240
whether we should add into maybe

1721
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,880
between the master and should

1722
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,039
we don't put a must but we may put in

1723
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,240
may

1724
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,960
but i think it's okay to as a group russ

1725
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,480
we can defer it

1726
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,160
when we see nearly okay

1727
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,000
say that again russ

1728
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,079
adding it to the mail list is fine with

1729
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:08,799
me

1730
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,119
yeah yeah yeah yeah i think that they

1731
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:12,720
will be uh

1732
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,960
good too no thanks all right so what i'm

1733
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,720
hearing is that it's a is it okay to

1734
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,640
enter may i think just so we don't

1735
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,720
forget the point i think as an editor i

1736
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,319
would probably open up a request to just

1737
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,400
add it to the main list so it's it's so

1738
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,799
it's uh it stays as a reference from the

1739
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:27,920
document

1740
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,240
um rather than uh oh did you even talk

1741
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,440
about it right so it's at least an

1742
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,720
intentional day

1743
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:36,640
as opposed to a apparent omission so

1744
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,480
yeah akira you're on thecube

1745
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,640
um yes um

1746
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,359
to write it in the cddl in the deep

1747
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:52,880
protocol format i was copying the uh

1748
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,400
description from the suit so um cdo it's

1749
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,280
uh

1750
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,839
there's three words used instead of a

1751
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:03,760
master may or should so it's required

1752
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,640
and recommended and it was optional so

1753
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,119
um yeah probably it's

1754
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,880
pretty much the same with the muscle

1755
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,880
going to be required

1756
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,760
and may is optional

1757
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,280
and uh

1758
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,240
um hsa it's just lms

1759
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,640
i i'm fine with the i'm having as

1760
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,640
recommended

1761
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,240
yes

1762
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,520
i think we have consensus

1763
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:44,400
did we lose dave

1764
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,799
dave

1765
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,640
you still there i can still hear you can

1766
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,280
you hear me okay yeah your your video

1767
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,160
froze there for a little bit

1768
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,160
yeah i lost you guys but uh

1769
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,760
uh as long as i'm back as long as i can

1770
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,839
keep hearing echo for myself in the

1771
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:04,079
faint i'll keep going so

1772
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,760
all right so i'm gonna keep moving on

1773
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,280
since i don't think there's anybody else

1774
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,720
in the cube but tell me to go back if i

1775
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,039
need to all right we're now going to

1776
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,440
move into the eat section so now for for

1777
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,319
uh

1778
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,238
rat spokes and so all but the last

1779
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,880
summary slide left is about attestation

1780
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,439
claims and so on okay

1781
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,399
so uh issue 171

1782
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,239
oh no

1783
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,839
but we lost dave all together

1784
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,120
we lost

1785
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,439
it it's us

1786
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,920
it yeah it keeps going out now yes but

1787
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,560
uh you know yeah no we we actually lost

1788
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,960
everything dave

1789
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,719
yeah

1790
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,960
but you can hear me now i can hear it

1791
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,600
i yep

1792
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,799
so the question is whether i should

1793
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:11,040
share

1794
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,640
you're welcome to project okay but i'm

1795
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,520
going to try it again here

1796
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,560
all right and so we are back on

1797
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,679
we were somewhere around right

1798
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:26,799
you were

1799
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:27,520
yeah

1800
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,640
that's where you were

1801
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,319
all right so we're saying uh the rats

1802
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,080
working group defines the notion of an

1803
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,000
eat profile and this is what the eat

1804
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,238
document says you must specify when

1805
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,479
doing an e profile right and we've said

1806
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,319
we need to have an eat profile for how

1807
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,000
does cheap use eat right and so that's

1808
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,759
what issue 171 is so let's listen

1809
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,040
there's just the bullet items that are

1810
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,640
the required things and the eat spec

1811
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,479
that you must do the following okay

1812
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:49,759
so that's our checklist so we're gonna

1813
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,399
walk through that checklist

1814
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,198
okay

1815
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:55,520
so uh the first one

1816
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,760
um and by the way there could be errors

1817
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,080
in these but our our intuition was it's

1818
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,600
always better to put something even if

1819
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,120
it's wrong because people tell us that

1820
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,760
it's wrong right and so uh there's no

1821
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,360
claim that these are necessarily the

1822
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,040
correct answers but these are answers

1823
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,800
right so people can tell us oh no no

1824
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,480
this is wrong you should do x instead so

1825
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,760
that's the goal here keep that in mind

1826
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,520
okay

1827
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,120
so the first one we needed something

1828
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,040
that was the profile label

1829
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,760
and so right now uh and so the profile

1830
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,239
labels are encouraged to be uris and so

1831
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,400
right now for that uri since we just

1832
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,760
need something as a placeholder we're

1833
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,840
using the draft name so here's the url

1834
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,000
of the draft with a note that says

1835
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,840
eventually the uri will be the rfc

1836
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,199
number right there's nothing in the each

1837
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:37,199
spec that says there's a convention to

1838
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,440
use for the uri so i'm making one up

1839
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,560
that says the rfc uh uri is the is the

1840
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,880
uri to use their rats working group

1841
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,320
might say use something other than that

1842
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,520
but since

1843
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,120
uh there may be changes between now and

1844
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,800
then we at least went on a temporary uri

1845
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,560
and certainly the draft uri is going to

1846
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,600
be a temporary one so

1847
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,800
see honestly you've got hotness on the

1848
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,600
cube

1849
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,080
uh dave uh

1850
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,880
i wonder whether um that profile label

1851
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,480
should be

1852
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,920
should also include

1853
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,840
other options because it looks like a

1854
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,960
very long uri for each at the station

1855
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,000
right

1856
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,320
even if it's only the rfc number

1857
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,560
attached to that uh

1858
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,920
uri

1859
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,840
to that to the data tracker something

1860
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,840
something um

1861
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,239
or rfc editor i yeah so maybe maybe we

1862
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,000
there's there should be maybe some

1863
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,159
profile labels um

1864
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,880
sort of registered for standards

1865
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,320
track uh

1866
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,320
or something like this you know what i

1867
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,199
mean

1868
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,199
i'd say that's would be a topic for the

1869
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,040
rats working group

1870
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,560
um that we would follow whatever

1871
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,159
convention they set and right now my

1872
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,679
understanding is there is no convention

1873
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,280
and so i had to please pick something

1874
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,960
but i think your comment would be a very

1875
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,320
appropriate comment to make in their ass

1876
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,840
working group okay i will do that

1877
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,640
um so then there's a the next section is

1878
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,679
just about um not keys per se but just

1879
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:06,320
use of seaborne other encodings and so

1880
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,120
uh

1881
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,040
we already agree that there's only cbor

1882
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,159
we've already made changes in the

1883
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,080
protocol spec before to use definite

1884
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,080
length arrays and maps

1885
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,159
and so i've extrapolated from there only

1886
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,520
definite linked strings are allowed

1887
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,719
there's note about preferred

1888
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,560
serialization and you have to say what

1889
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,199
encoders and decoders have to do

1890
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,280
and so right now the proposal is

1891
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,920
encoders must use preferred and decoders

1892
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,679
need not accept non-preferred so if you

1893
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,120
want interoperability use the preferred

1894
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,360
serialization

1895
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,120
we never used seaboard tags we had an

1896
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,520
issue about that i think two ietfs ago

1897
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,120
where we had that agreement

1898
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,520
there's a whole section on freshness

1899
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,400
and uh detached eat bundles i am not the

1900
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,360
expert on so we arbitrarily said dib use

1901
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,839
is permitted

1902
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,159
okay hopefully audio just came back

1903
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,120
yeah

1904
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,760
so my analogy was that detached bundles

1905
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,480
as long as we're gonna allow uh severed

1906
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,520
uh suit manifest then maybe detached eat

1907
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,440
bundles are similar but open to feedback

1908
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,440
on that go ahead

1909
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,640
harness uh harness yeah almost

1910
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,920
hey hey you're about to start with h

1911
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,679
hey hank is on the queue

1912
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:26,080
hi i'm hans hinken

1913
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:26,450
um

1914
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:27,760
[Music]

1915
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,640
so

1916
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:33,040
i want to say that your profile for each

1917
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,239
looks like a cool eat

1918
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,280
which is a problem i would say in rats

1919
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,159
again

1920
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:42,159
because most of these decisions here i

1921
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:45,040
think are very good

1922
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,920
demarcation line where we want to

1923
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,000
cut maybe things off and do into other

1924
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,560
ids and this looks like a good call for

1925
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,000
each so while you

1926
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,159
are bringing this up here

1927
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:58,560
as a profile for it

1928
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,800
i'll even go so far and saying this

1929
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,960
could be the core eat

1930
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,560
not not talking about the detached eat

1931
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,120
bundle because that's new and you know

1932
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,960
so but the rest

1933
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,120
actually i'd say

1934
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,640
that could be eat

1935
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:16,640
maybe we should say that at rats also

1936
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,600
so

1937
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,600
volunteering or

1938
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,560
or

1939
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,800
i'm volunteering saying that pull

1940
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,520
request 171 i guess it's a pull request

1941
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,440
right it was an issue i don't know the

1942
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,280
thing in bit up on cheap that is 171

1943
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,920
could be a good bundle that we can

1944
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,600
publish soon

1945
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,920
that is the minimum required

1946
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,760
because this looks really much like the

1947
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,320
minimum requirements that we need yeah

1948
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,760
so yeah

1949
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,600
that's fair but

1950
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,199
okay well this is really the first

1951
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:48,880
example of any profile right so we're

1952
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,239
kind of pioneering and setting an

1953
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,000
example right i don't know of any other

1954
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:52,719
yeah

1955
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:54,880
there are others so so and hanes was

1956
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,360
saying not so much because i know of a

1957
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,960
tsa token

1958
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,840
and and such so uh it's psas or psa

1959
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,239
token and uh yeah so no this is not the

1960
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,159
first definitely

1961
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:09,120
um but but i think it also overlaps a

1962
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,520
lot so honest if you can't see anything

1963
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,000
here that wouldn't align with c

1964
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,159
and so this could be eat

1965
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,320
might be the core of eat okay i will

1966
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,560
bring this up yeah i volunteer so to say

1967
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,960
i would be the bad guy yeah yeah that

1968
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,480
would be great hank because uh right now

1969
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,920
we have text in the document for this

1970
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,280
and it'd be great to remove text and

1971
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,640
just reference in each section that has

1972
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,199
you know a default or a core profile or

1973
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,640
whatever you want to call it so all

1974
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,480
right so i'm going to keep uh going out

1975
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,840
of the next section of the

1976
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,960
checklist uh so now we get into

1977
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,360
algorithms and things and so uh

1978
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,520
for coset algorithms that was the slide

1979
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,640
that we just walked through that was

1980
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,840
that table and that's in a different

1981
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,320
section so that checklist is see

1982
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,080
previous slide right

1983
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,719
um well i guess i had detached deep

1984
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,400
bundle on this slide that's a duplicate

1985
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,159
never mind uh and then for a

1986
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,760
verification kit identification i tried

1987
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,920
to make something up here so happy for

1988
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,199
somebody to tell me it's wrong or what i

1989
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:02,480
should say instead

1990
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,320
uh and so verification key

1991
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,880
identification right now it says

1992
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,199
the cosec key id is used with the key id

1993
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,440
is the hash of a public key or the

1994
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,520
public key may be used as a raw public

1995
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,440
key or a public key in a certificate but

1996
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,159
it's the hash the public key

1997
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,440
hoping that's at least something that's

1998
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,880
not broken

1999
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,960
and for endorsement identification right

2000
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,320
now it says it's optional but the

2001
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,920
semantics are same as the previous line

2002
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,520
again this was a put in something and if

2003
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,120
people have a better suggestion i think

2004
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,040
it's wrong and they'll tell us but

2005
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,120
that's the straw man

2006
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,000
okay

2007
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,199
seeing nobody at the mic line i'm gonna

2008
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:40,480
keep going

2009
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:44,320
uh harness yeah uh hi dave um on the on

2010
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,679
the key id

2011
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,280
so um what i've seen uh being done which

2012
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,880
is and in some sense a little bit

2013
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,880
unfortunate is is

2014
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,000
actually to use um the claims inside for

2015
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,280
example the instance id

2016
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,560
as a as a way to identify the key and

2017
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,800
that's not necessarily the hash of the

2018
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,320
public key it's for example a uuid or

2019
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,480
something similar so

2020
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,719
maybe that's more recommended one

2021
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,400
recommended approach but there's all

2022
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,280
sorts of different schemes for naming

2023
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,320
um

2024
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,080
sort of like the

2025
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,679
the

2026
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:22,480
um

2027
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,440
the specific instance of of

2028
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,679
the device or the chip that

2029
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,520
you are testing

2030
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,199
so so

2031
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,679
in teep we allow certificates or raw

2032
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,199
public keys and we were talking about

2033
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:36,480
claims i interpret that as something

2034
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,840
would only apply to certificates how

2035
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,120
would that apply if using raw public

2036
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,360
keys

2037
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,520
like

2038
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,560
it would

2039
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,040
even for raw public keys you can you can

2040
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,760
attach a name to it

2041
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,320
okay like the raw public key is like

2042
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,480
conceptually like it's like a

2043
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,520
a

2044
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,440
symmetric key right in that in that

2045
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,799
sense from the lookup point of view

2046
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,440
it if you'd like to propose specific

2047
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,800
text that you think are consistent with

2048
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,520
say other eat profilers or whatever uh

2049
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,600
i'd be happy to match again this is the

2050
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,880
case where i was trying to tease out

2051
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,320
suggestions so okay cool

2052
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,280
but you know if you're doing something

2053
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,040
another document we then there's a good

2054
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,239
reason to say hey in a constrained

2055
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,760
implementation you should be able to do

2056
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,040
two different things and use the same

2057
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,880
rule and so consistency across heat

2058
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,719
profiles is great if you want to point

2059
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:26,480
me to something else that says hey let's

2060
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,000
propose pulling this text out of another

2061
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,679
document or even moving this into the

2062
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,920
core eat profile or something like that

2063
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,840
and just reference kind of eat spec

2064
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,400
i'm off of that so

2065
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,800
uh yeah just to jump in ben cadeck as

2066
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,600
the responsible ad

2067
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,560
to

2068
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,640
hammer through hannes's point about the

2069
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,480
key id like there are cases where the

2070
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,640
key id might just be a single byte zero

2071
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,880
one

2072
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,600
depending on and it's not required to be

2073
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,880
tied to the specific key material at all

2074
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,800
so if hanas could propose some slight

2075
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,480
text changes here because the current

2076
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,239
text on the slide is sort of

2077
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:03,679
saying that it's always the hash of the

2078
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,120
public key and that's not that's

2079
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,560
misleading

2080
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,400
okay

2081
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,920
sounds good thanks honest

2082
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:13,040
you have the action on this one

2083
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,400
okay so claims

2084
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,360
yeah

2085
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,120
let's now get into the claims part and

2086
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,640
we've had lots of discussion including

2087
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,120
at the uh t suit rats interim meeting

2088
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,040
about claims okay

2089
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,280
so right now on the eat profile

2090
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,719
um all the claims relevant are in the uh

2091
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,480
optional claims section right there's

2092
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,120
there's no single case where a

2093
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,840
particular claim is uh is actually

2094
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,320
required in all possible deep cases

2095
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,840
right so the next one next slide

2096
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,760
actually has all those claims but right

2097
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,600
now they're all in the optional section

2098
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,159
there's nothing in the required or

2099
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,480
are prohibited sections um and so when

2100
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,760
we get to the next slide keep that in

2101
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,040
mind in case you think there's something

2102
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,159
on there that should be listed as

2103
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:57,280
required and so uh the next slides cover

2104
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,800
every all the claims that are relevant

2105
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,880
for the profile for t

2106
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,960
but uh none of them are individually

2107
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,400
required right you've got to have enough

2108
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,000
to be able to pass stuff but there's no

2109
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,360
single one that i could think of that

2110
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,199
was actually required but i want you to

2111
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:10,480
keep that in mind and get up the mic

2112
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,679
whatever if you see something that you

2113
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:12,960
think oh no that should be required in

2114
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,600
all cases okay

2115
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,560
the

2116
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,560
last point is worth that mentioning here

2117
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,360
for suit folks just in case uh brendan

2118
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,040
or hank or somebody says that it's wrong

2119
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,199
please review this so call attention to

2120
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:26,000
it

2121
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,159
uh for manifest and software evidence

2122
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:30,400
claims okay so right now the software

2123
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,679
name claim

2124
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:32,960
in rats

2125
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,520
um the placeholder is that the software

2126
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,840
and in claim holds the uri of the suit

2127
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,440
manifest for that component right we

2128
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,480
need something that's the unique

2129
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,719
identifier for that and so right now uh

2130
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,960
brennan suggests the canonical uri but

2131
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,120
it's still the canonical uri of the suit

2132
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,520
manifest right as opposed to some other

2133
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,840
uri in other words we're referencing the

2134
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,239
uh the software component by its

2135
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,480
manifest as being the official id right

2136
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,040
so that's the proposal and yeah i get uh

2137
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,560
we can add the word canonical in front

2138
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,480
of uri if that makes people happier i

2139
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,719
agree with brennan's point there

2140
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:06,080
but since this is a point we've never

2141
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,560
discussed before how do you marry the uh

2142
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,239
the e requirements with the suit

2143
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:13,600
manifest and so the proposal is uh oh

2144
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,040
brandon please get up the mic and tell

2145
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,880
me what what words you'd like changed or

2146
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,480
whatever because uh if you have a

2147
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,759
suggestion happy to accept

2148
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,480
or paste it into the chat if you want a

2149
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:27,840
specific wording there otherwise i'll go

2150
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,520
on if i don't see somebody at the mic so

2151
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,239
okay

2152
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,600
i'm gonna go on i have to go back

2153
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,360
there's a specific element in the suit

2154
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,080
manifest called the canonical uri it's

2155
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,639
the the point of it is to point back to

2156
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,880
a place that you can find a full copy of

2157
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,440
the manifest so that should

2158
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,960
probably be the right tool for the job

2159
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,159
okay

2160
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:55,638
yep make sense

2161
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,679
this would be you know like canonical

2162
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,280
hyphen uri or however it appears in the

2163
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,759
subspec

2164
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,719
um okay actually

2165
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,080
i didn't miss a slide here this is the

2166
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,840
next one yeah okay

2167
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,120
so i just wanted to so this issue 165

2168
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,560
was the one that was discussed at the

2169
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,719
intro meeting where we went through the

2170
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,800
various claims that were in the

2171
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,679
uh draft burke hall's rat suit claims

2172
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,920
uh that document defines some system

2173
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,639
claims and some um

2174
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,120
suit specific claims and so the the the

2175
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,960
relevant discussion for teep was in the

2176
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,520
system claims section of that document

2177
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,719
uh

2178
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:33,760
now

2179
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,040
uh

2180
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,960
this gets back to one of the points that

2181
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,800
here was talking about and kira talked

2182
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,159
about the background check model and

2183
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:42,400
passport model where in t we've said the

2184
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,000
background check model is the one that

2185
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,600
is the more typical because it works

2186
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,600
better with constrained devices for for

2187
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,560
a team

2188
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,120
but it turns out that the passport model

2189
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,480
is not actually

2190
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,400
precluded in teep if somebody wants to

2191
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,080
do that and that gets to the point that

2192
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,679
the t protocol does not actually have a

2193
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:59,760
hard dependency on the evidence format

2194
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,679
of the e-format or whatever because it's

2195
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:04,239
just a pass-through right so it turns

2196
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:05,440
out you could actually use the t

2197
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,199
protocol with attestation results for

2198
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,800
that matter in the passport model right

2199
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,920
you'd stick it into the field that's

2200
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,520
currently labeled evidence and so i'll

2201
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,199
probably file a request and just point

2202
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,280
this out then whether it's evidence or

2203
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,800
attestation results just typically

2204
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,719
evidence right your your e could be an

2205
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:20,320
attestation results eat if you're using

2206
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,560
the passport model okay so the point is

2207
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,159
that the claims that are in here that

2208
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:27,120
are in the profile

2209
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,599
uh-oh

2210
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:44,120
yeah i think it's dave

2211
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,040
let me revoke his screen

2212
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,639
you can hear me okay

2213
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:53,760
yeah i hear it

2214
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,880
all right so saying that

2215
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,320
yeah

2216
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,320
the

2217
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,880
claims that are in that that are in the

2218
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,040
list on the next slide and things are

2219
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,040
really things that the remember the the

2220
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,360
tam is a relying party

2221
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,520
the relying parties consume attestation

2222
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,600
results not evidence

2223
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,360
so the claims that are talked about in

2224
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,760
the profile is really things for which

2225
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,760
the attestation results need to be able

2226
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,920
to report to the tam

2227
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,239
now often the claims and the attestation

2228
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:25,840
results are going to be derived from

2229
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,679
claims in the evidence

2230
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,120
so the claims that we're talking about

2231
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,400
might be things that appear in the

2232
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,920
evidence for a purpose of being copied

2233
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,520
into attestation results but the end of

2234
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,360
the day these are claims that the

2235
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:40,440
relying party needs to be able to get

2236
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,040
hank is in the queue but yeah but i'm

2237
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,040
talking to i want to talk to dave so i'm

2238
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:51,920
just

2239
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,800
wasting my time

2240
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,199
sitting down

2241
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:00,320
looking at the qr code

2242
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,120
we

2243
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:04,559
lost them all together

2244
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,360
periodically

2245
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,199
they're getting in

2246
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:13,559
on the dave appears to be offline

2247
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:17,520
i was just trying to say a joke

2248
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,120
dave's picture on the

2249
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,239
changes to his picture when he was young

2250
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:27,239
so

2251
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,760
yeah akira i think dave completely

2252
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,360
dropped off

2253
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:41,839
because i see he shows off offline

2254
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,600
oh now i don't see him at all

2255
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:49,390
[Laughter]

2256
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,480
i think there's actually

2257
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,199
no one so this is hank i want to take uh

2258
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,800
make a comment on the

2259
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,199
third bullet item of the previous slide

2260
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,120
we have seen

2261
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,120
uh that says that uh claims in the

2262
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,840
testation results can be copied over

2263
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,400
from evidence so i have a

2264
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,080
relatively good

2265
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,679
visual memory

2266
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:14,800
and that is a big problem

2267
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,639
and there's dave

2268
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,400
all right if you can hear me can you

2269
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,960
repeat your comment sure no problem so

2270
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,400
hi this is hank

2271
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,639
i've read on the list i have to state my

2272
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,360
name so i'm i'm consistently doing this

2273
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:29,820
now

2274
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:32,280
[Laughter]

2275
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,520
[Music]

2276
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,639
so

2277
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,880
so i think the problem here is with the

2278
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,600
um third bullet item on the previously

2279
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,159
shown list nancy is going there

2280
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:44,800
yeah dave since we lost you i i decided

2281
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,440
to just share the slides for you

2282
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,239
uh

2283
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:48,960
but

2284
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,520
now one up 15 is fine

2285
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,920
this one yeah so the third item says

2286
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,840
claims and attestation results might be

2287
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,239
copied from evidence

2288
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:01,040
that's bad

2289
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,440
because now

2290
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,840
you do not know what that means

2291
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,159
if you just do a copy

2292
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,000
of the value

2293
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,440
into an attestation result

2294
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,719
what you what the semantics now are is

2295
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:20,159
this is created by the verifier because

2296
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,960
attestation results are created by the

2297
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,120
way affair and they're conveyed for

2298
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,679
consumption to the alliance party so the

2299
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:30,639
verifier created this claim

2300
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,560
it is very important

2301
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,719
to add to the

2302
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,960
definition of that claim

2303
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,000
that

2304
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,639
when it appears in the testation result

2305
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,320
this is not evidence but

2306
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,960
this is the output of a policy

2307
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,199
that does a i don't know bytes copy of

2308
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,199
the value from evidence

2309
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,199
into the attestation result one by one

2310
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,920
there's a policy that says if i like the

2311
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,840
rest of the evidence then i can copy

2312
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,840
this as complementary information into

2313
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,679
an attestation result it's very

2314
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:04,880
different

2315
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,280
to the fact that it appears in evidence

2316
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,360
that has a different meaning

2317
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,159
so

2318
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,120
now i would be stuck with understanding

2319
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,520
who signed that conceptual message and

2320
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,320
you are not obligated to say this is an

2321
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,520
attestation result eat it's just a cwt

2322
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,159
never forget that now you have to

2323
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:27,280
understand that the signature is doing

2324
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,760
the context and segment x and that's

2325
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:33,040
really bad so there has to be an out of

2326
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,639
band agreement between the relying party

2327
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:39,440
and the verifier that this is a copied

2328
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,440
overvalue from evidence

2329
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,679
and if you can't establish that

2330
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,280
out-of-band context this is broken

2331
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,520
i just have to really point that out

2332
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,960
okay

2333
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,600
unless you're doing something else that

2334
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,400
is co-locating another verifier

2335
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,360
on the entity that's the relying party

2336
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,080
and then say sure we can relay that

2337
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,639
evidence actually and the party has a

2338
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,040
stop verifier that can make sense out of

2339
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,600
that and now evidence but that is

2340
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,000
co-located with attestation results i

2341
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,440
think that's that's a very

2342
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,760
underestimated problem for consistency

2343
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,600
and it will break a lot of levels of

2344
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,400
things and if not done right so i think

2345
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,199
item three is really dangerous if not

2346
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,839
done correctly

2347
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:33,600
i'm hoping i'm back again

2348
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,120
yes you want to summarize where we're at

2349
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,560
or what to do next

2350
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,520
well i

2351
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,239
can you do like a succinct summary and

2352
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,840
also i want to make sure that it gets

2353
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,800
captured don't do three without explicit

2354
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,440
highlight that there's policy on the

2355
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,239
verifier that did this copying

2356
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:53,360
always imply if a raw

2357
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,520
value from evidence appears and hit the

2358
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,440
station results with this name same

2359
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,080
claim type claim name right

2360
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,320
make sure that is out-of-band policy

2361
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,600
established that's then you are jesus

2362
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:09,600
we lost dave again i'm not doing this

2363
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,239
it seems like well the policy would be

2364
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:13,760
out of scope i think

2365
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,800
but but that

2366
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,800
text on

2367
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,239
having policy is not out of scope

2368
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:25,440
no defining how this is done yes but

2369
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,040
there has to be text

2370
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,520
either you agreed on policy or you're

2371
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,960
doing very something harmful to the

2372
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,639
internet okay

2373
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:34,560
i would think that's more of a security

2374
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,280
consideration

2375
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,520
i think there's a design flaw that has

2376
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,719
to be documented

2377
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:43,679
um

2378
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,480
if i have audio right now then the point

2379
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,320
is that third bullet fair is just a

2380
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,239
statement about what a verifier could

2381
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:51,760
have policy that it chooses to do

2382
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,120
there's nothing that keep this is just

2383
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,800
an informational note to the reader that

2384
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,199
says the verifier could have that policy

2385
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:58,480
from the parts that i could hear what

2386
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,239
hank was saying i actually agree and

2387
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,080
there's nothing in team that actually

2388
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,440
says other

2389
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,760
um so i think what hank said the intent

2390
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,320
is that the draft says what hank said uh

2391
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,639
the the slide is just an fyi by the way

2392
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:13,040
your verifier could choose to copy stuff

2393
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,960
but what heap actually depends on is

2394
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,560
having some claims in the attestation

2395
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,080
results whether they come from evidence

2396
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:21,120
or someplace else um it does the type

2397
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,719
has no way to know because it only sees

2398
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,120
the the the attestation results at their

2399
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,760
lying party so and that is a big problem

2400
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,199
the tip must know just saying and the

2401
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,679
tip can't know is a design error and i

2402
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:35,760
would oppose that

2403
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,280
okay then we'll have to talk about that

2404
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,120
because when talking about a relying

2405
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,440
party any particular relying parties

2406
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,360
attestation results has no visibility

2407
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,639
what the evidence is that's not their

2408
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:46,880
language exactly but it can't know that

2409
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,800
you got evidence because you're copying

2410
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,120
evidence in and as you just said it has

2411
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,239
no dealing with that you're breaking a

2412
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:56,000
rule here

2413
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,960
that's not good okay

2414
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,639
i i don't know what rule you're breaking

2415
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:01,440
so

2416
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,120
i said i only heard that

2417
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,880
what you're saying you are conveying

2418
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,360
evidence to a relying party

2419
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,159
period i i think as long as he documents

2420
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:12,480
the notes and the policies if it's the

2421
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,960
contained and attestation result it

2422
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,000
doesn't matter

2423
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,080
never conveyed to our lying party ever

2424
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,600
yeah but item three says so

2425
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,639
no it doesn't yes it does

2426
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,320
and this is our this is this is our

2427
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,000
disagreement this we have to talk about

2428
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,280
yeah

2429
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,840
because yeah

2430
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,840
so again what happens here is it says

2431
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,600
the claims and the attestation results

2432
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,679
might have been copied by a verifier not

2433
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:38,960
their lying party from the evidence

2434
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,800
they're airing yeah

2435
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,560
but if they are just copied how do you

2436
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,800
know who created them did the verifier

2437
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,199
create them did the attester create them

2438
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,560
does the lion party understand that no

2439
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,360
nope

2440
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:54,159
exactly and that is a problem well we

2441
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:55,920
can talk about that in rats or whatever

2442
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:56,800
i don't

2443
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,560
extensively yes

2444
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,199
okay so nancy can we go on to the next

2445
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:04,199
slide

2446
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,719
all right

2447
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,800
this is the set of claims we've been

2448
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,320
talking about all along you can see

2449
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,159
draft 07 is the middle column that's

2450
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,920
what the draft used to say what the

2451
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,560
graph now says is the right side so you

2452
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,480
can see all of those are now referenced

2453
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,239
again this is the system claims category

2454
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,480
not the suit claims category all these

2455
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,320
reference eat except for the one that we

2456
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,679
had the long discussion at the intro

2457
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:31,920
meeting that's the class identifier that

2458
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,360
one there's no other document to refer

2459
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,199
to yet so that one still points to the

2460
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:37,600
existing burkhals document

2461
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,920
where eventually that should point to

2462
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,600
something whether we pull that text into

2463
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,600
this document or whatever else the point

2464
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,679
is there is still a class identifier

2465
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:47,679
that we need to say something about and

2466
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:48,960
that's what all the discussion the intro

2467
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,320
meeting was about it's just highlighting

2468
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,679
that that um this issue isn't um it's

2469
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:54,960
close to the set to the extent that we

2470
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,280
can close it now but um it does still

2471
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,120
have uh what do we do for the class of

2472
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:02,559
device in the t context so

2473
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,159
since we spent all the intro meeting

2474
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:05,920
talking about that i think we can go on

2475
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,239
um

2476
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,600
since we've had lots of recent

2477
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,199
discussion all right

2478
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:14,239
so the proposed next steps uh are to

2479
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:16,159
update the document with feedback from

2480
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,000
the hackathon all the discussion from

2481
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,120
this meeting

2482
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,360
the hope is that whatever the next rev

2483
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,280
is we'll be ready for working group last

2484
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,600
call because hopefully we're teasing out

2485
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,120
all the last issues and stuff now

2486
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,600
between implementation and spec review

2487
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,040
that the implementations are complete

2488
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,440
enough that we hope all the issues are

2489
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,199
found that would at least block us from

2490
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:37,840
entering working your blast call right

2491
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,600
i'm wondering

2492
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,600
yeah and i'm wondering dave given the

2493
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,920
iot nature of this we can also trigger

2494
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,560
an early review to the iot directorate

2495
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,760
and

2496
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,560
hack security directorate

2497
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,840
yeah whether you do that in parallel

2498
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,440
with working group last call or what but

2499
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,280
yeah that sounds great i can do it even

2500
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,560
before

2501
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:57,520
okay

2502
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,560
so once once you um generate a new

2503
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,000
version

2504
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,920
dave let me know and i can kick off the

2505
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,800
early reviews how's that okay now i i do

2506
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,719
want to huddle with uh hank to see if we

2507
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:10,080
can work out what the right thing is in

2508
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,360
that last point so that's the only thing

2509
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,239
that really

2510
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:13,520
worries me right now that i don't have a

2511
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,880
good understanding i think everything

2512
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:15,920
else we've discussed i have a good

2513
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,440
understanding of what the editors can do

2514
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,119
next i think hank's point we want to

2515
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:20,560
follow up on try to work out what the

2516
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,320
proposal will be so

2517
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,800
yeah and if it could be documented as an

2518
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,440
issue that way we we all get visibility

2519
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,400
too

2520
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,320
yeah on a path forward

2521
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:33,040
so hank you're welcome to file an issue

2522
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:34,960
this is hank

2523
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,400
so uh

2524
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,119
so so the thing is um that i was talking

2525
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:41,360
about exactly that point with lawrence

2526
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,639
extensively

2527
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:46,159
and we have prepared a two uh early

2528
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:49,199
proposals how to deal with that okay and

2529
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,280
and and and i think there's even a very

2530
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,639
new pr look at the latest pr

2531
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:57,040
uh the youngest pr in the eat uh

2532
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,880
repository thing lawrence pushed

2533
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,320
something that's based on the discussion

2534
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,080
from the hackathon and it's about

2535
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,280
exactly that's probably what you talked

2536
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,159
about in the rats meeting then yes

2537
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:07,679
yeah

2538
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,440
he's saying it should be discussed in a

2539
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,880
rats meeting then

2540
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,400
yeah

2541
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,560
it should

2542
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,400
great

2543
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,400
well good

2544
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,040
i think we're making progress

2545
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,880
and dave you're you're like right on

2546
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,760
time sorry i rushed you earlier

2547
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,239
was that it

2548
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:29,520
yep

2549
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,119
okay

2550
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:35,119
with that then um

2551
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,840
we have

2552
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:40,960
a presenter

2553
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,560
i lost my screen one second

2554
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:53,360
pengling are you online

2555
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,080
yes i'm here hi everyone

2556
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,480
hello

2557
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,320
sorry i'm trying to bring all my too

2558
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,159
many windows

2559
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,638
um

2560
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:08,000
this one nope

2561
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,760
all right let me relinquish

2562
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,239
the screen

2563
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:25,600
and give you

2564
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,400
go ahead and share your slides unless

2565
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,560
you want me to

2566
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:31,950
uh yes

2567
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:33,280
[Music]

2568
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,800
how how do i share the screen

2569
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,000
okay it may be easier if i do it hold on

2570
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,119
a sec

2571
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,679
okay thank you

2572
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,080
confidential computing

2573
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:51,119
oh i found that you found it okay

2574
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,520
um

2575
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,520
here this one

2576
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,960
there we go

2577
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:24,159
yes thank you okay so hello everyone i

2578
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:26,639
would like to share uh maybe a use case

2579
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,199
or idea about uh can you speak up a

2580
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,400
little bit

2581
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,600
penguin

2582
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,440
we can barely is that better

2583
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:36,000
yes that's better yeah okay

2584
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,040
i would like to share a idea about uh

2585
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,040
computational computing in the computing

2586
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,480
aware network

2587
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,440
and

2588
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,199
the reason i would like to share in the

2589
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,040
tip is because that

2590
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,280
this architecture will you use tip

2591
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,600
protocol to implement the

2592
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,080
uh this configuration computing so

2593
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,960
uh next slide is about the so first we

2594
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,520
need to figure out what is can what is a

2595
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,560
computing aware network

2596
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,199
literally it's an idea about the

2597
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:07,600
which is computing and network resource

2598
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,840
joint optimization based on the

2599
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,639
awareness control and management over

2600
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:14,719
network and computing resource to

2601
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,639
determine the appropriate service node

2602
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,960
and dispatch the service request and

2603
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,360
provide a better use experience

2604
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,280
not only the

2605
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,320
atf but also the itu also mentioned this

2606
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:30,239
idea like the computing force network or

2607
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:32,800
computing power network maybe they are a

2608
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,320
little bit different but i think the

2609
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,080
basic idea is

2610
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,600
similar

2611
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,480
so

2612
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,800
next slide is about

2613
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,520
the brief architecture of can so

2614
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,000
in the left picture it shows that the

2615
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,080
computing resource consumer and the

2616
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,239
computing resource provider will

2617
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:51,520
communicate with

2618
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,719
with each other by the can network and

2619
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:55,520
even

2620
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,159
dispatch or issue a computing task

2621
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:59,920
during the network

2622
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,880
so the red side of the picture shows

2623
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,600
that the logical layer of the can and

2624
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,719
the first

2625
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:09,040
layer is operation layer it's about the

2626
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,440
computing resource transaction a unified

2627
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:14,239
operation of open capability etc and the

2628
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:16,800
second layer is orchestration and

2629
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,600
management layer it's about the

2630
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,520
computing resource orchestration air

2631
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:24,800
engine and this item it should be the

2632
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,520
business management is a mystic i'm

2633
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,480
sorry and the third layer is the

2634
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,719
can foundation it's about the edge

2635
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:34,880
computing resource and the central

2636
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,719
computer resource and this resource will

2637
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:39,840
communicate

2638
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,159
with each other by the ip network and

2639
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:43,920
this app network should be the can

2640
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,000
network and this protocol

2641
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,960
has haven't been decided yet but it will

2642
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:52,080
be discarded in the birth of can uh can

2643
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:55,119
uh i think it's a tuesday or so i'm not

2644
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:58,560
sure so the difference between

2645
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,719
uh between the care and the cloud

2646
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:03,119
computing is that that can is based on

2647
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:05,440
network layer so computing task

2648
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:08,320
requirement and scheduling are carried

2649
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:11,199
by protocols in app network from the

2650
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,679
perspective of network layer cloud

2651
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:16,159
computing is just application layer data

2652
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:19,280
which cannot be aware by the network

2653
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,760
so the advantage of the account is that

2654
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,280
the network latency is awareness and the

2655
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,520
network topology is awareness and the

2656
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,440
convergence with network source and the

2657
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,719
computing resource is available uh think

2658
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:35,119
about uh that if you use

2659
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:37,920
uh cloud computing the cloud computing

2660
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,320
data flow will just be an application

2661
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:43,600
layer in the network and there's a

2662
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,679
decouple of the

2663
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:48,239
cloud computing and the network so i

2664
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:51,760
think the can is a better option for the

2665
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,159
applications that have the latency

2666
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:57,600
sensitive and some requirements

2667
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,400
so

2668
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,800
next slide is that

2669
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,719
why we need confidential computing you

2670
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:03,520
can

2671
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,040
and i think the requirement is from the

2672
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,840
can user if the computing resource is a

2673
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,080
third-party resource like the edge

2674
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,239
computer resource which both they can

2675
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:16,560
and the network user cannot trust its

2676
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,880
security then we need the confidential

2677
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,880
computing technology

2678
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,840
so if the another is that if the network

2679
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,840
user cannot trust the

2680
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,080
computing resource controlled by the

2681
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:30,239
cadillac the central consumer resource

2682
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:31,520
then the competition computing

2683
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,760
technology also is also needed

2684
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,480
so

2685
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,400
when we introduce the computational

2686
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,480
computing to the network i think the two

2687
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:41,360
components are mostly involved the first

2688
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,880
one is that the

2689
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,040
cpu of computing resource

2690
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,040
must have the feature like the computer

2691
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:50,560
computing like the sdx tdx etc and the

2692
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,719
second is that the execution and the

2693
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:55,280
management layer must have the

2694
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:56,880
confidential computing feature which

2695
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,920
supports

2696
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,239
like tip and rest

2697
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:03,280
so so next slide is the

2698
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,920
main architecture so i think

2699
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,480
lots of you have familiar with tip and

2700
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,360
rats but in this architecture we added

2701
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,560
two components one is middleware and the

2702
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,040
other is midway repo and the reason is

2703
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,520
that we want the user to use

2704
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,000
computational computing in a network

2705
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,480
with convenient which means that

2706
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,639
if network want to use the computational

2707
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,320
computing resource it

2708
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,480
doesn't have to change i have to change

2709
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,880
any of its source code it just says that

2710
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,119
well it's a computing resource it's a

2711
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:37,119
competitive computing resource so i just

2712
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:40,159
use it i don't do it doesn't have to

2713
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:43,119
change anything of my source code so

2714
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,520
another uh function of the middleware is

2715
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,679
that it can provide like remote

2716
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:50,800
attestation and provisioning instead of

2717
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,800
let the application itself to the

2718
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,119
function i think this is much more

2719
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:56,960
convenient than the

2720
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,960
traditional uh

2721
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,480
t or

2722
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,080
red architecture

2723
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,600
so this is

2724
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,719
the main

2725
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:07,840
idea of this draft

2726
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,280
and the next

2727
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,159
shows that how how this works so

2728
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:13,760
if uh

2729
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,119
if if a

2730
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:17,280
application owner want to request for

2731
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,520
the conversation computer resource it

2732
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,880
first will

2733
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,840
connect to the mlc all the time then the

2734
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,440
second

2735
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,560
step is that the time it will establish

2736
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,679
connections to the broker and send the

2737
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,360
provisioning information like the

2738
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,600
middleware to the t broker step three

2739
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,280
will be that the tip broker will trigger

2740
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,520
this maybe it's a hypervisor to

2741
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,639
establish

2742
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,639
establish the targeting environment with

2743
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:46,400
tip agent and middleware so

2744
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,560
the mapping between the tip concept and

2745
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,480
the instantiation is that

2746
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,400
the left side is the concept and the

2747
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,560
right side is the instantiation in the

2748
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:57,360
engineering so the mlc time and the

2749
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,360
middleware ripple may be a computing

2750
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:02,239
resource expression in in can and the pt

2751
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:05,119
broker may be a function of stack and

2752
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:07,280
the tip agent at the middleware maybe

2753
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,840
some openstack initiates the guest vm

2754
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,440
which includes a chip agent and a

2755
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,440
specific middleware like a

2756
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:16,560
anarchogram and or clone these three

2757
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,159
names are

2758
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:20,239
like some middleware or runtime that

2759
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:21,760
could provide a

2760
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:24,239
unified or very convenient interface to

2761
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:26,480
the user which they doesn't have to

2762
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,719
change any of any of the source code

2763
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:32,080
which is more convenient for the

2764
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,760
application to use configuration

2765
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,679
computing

2766
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:37,040
so

2767
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:40,080
next slide is about the arrest in can so

2768
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:41,920
after the first provisioning of the

2769
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,800
middleware then the rats will will work

2770
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,960
on so the first step is that a

2771
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,280
application owner may ask for a remote

2772
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,600
attached remote attestation then the

2773
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,119
second step is that the middleware

2774
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:55,280
triggers a attestation environment to

2775
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:58,320
generate remote attestation evidence for

2776
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,719
targeting environment and step three is

2777
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:03,280
that the application owner gets the

2778
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,360
reference value and the reference value

2779
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,040
may be

2780
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,360
maybe could generate with source code

2781
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,119
and the images like the middleware and

2782
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:14,000
the tip agent maybe it's a

2783
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,080
could query from the third third-party

2784
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,920
authority for the

2785
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,840
reference value and the step four is

2786
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,239
that the middleware will return the

2787
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,159
evidence to a picture owner and the

2788
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:26,000
owner could match it with a reference

2789
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,719
reference value and decide if it will

2790
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:30,800
trust the attacking armament and there

2791
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,360
is a potential step five is that after

2792
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,440
the trusted targeting environment the

2793
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:38,560
pledge code application owner will

2794
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,800
provision is application to the

2795
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,520
targeting environment so after that the

2796
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,760
application will run in a trusted and

2797
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:46,880
confidential

2798
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:49,520
environment so that's a basic

2799
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,679
um idea of the

2800
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:54,880
rats how it works in this architecture

2801
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,639
and the mapping between the rights

2802
01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:00,159
concept and the instantiation is that

2803
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:02,000
for example the attestation environment

2804
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,760
could be called enclave an sp and rmm

2805
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,639
and etc and the targeting environment

2806
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:11,440
could be a guest vm which includes the

2807
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,760
tip middleware and application and the

2808
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,239
targeting environment may also be a

2809
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:17,520
process-based

2810
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,639
environment like the sgx so that in that

2811
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:23,280
way the t4 agent and the middleware will

2812
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:26,960
be a function or routine in a process

2813
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,560
so uh next slide slides is about the

2814
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,679
potential

2815
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:33,600
next step about this confidential

2816
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,639
computing network

2817
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:38,480
maybe

2818
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:42,159
it could be used as a specified uh tpu

2819
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:43,840
use case about the conversational

2820
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,320
computing with middleware or

2821
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,320
specify the right use case about the

2822
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,400
computational computing

2823
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,960
under its middleware or it could be that

2824
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,679
a unified tool or specification

2825
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:57,760
for appb owner to execute a remote

2826
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:00,239
edition and the provisioning

2827
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:01,440
so

2828
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,760
if you are interested in this idea maybe

2829
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,639
we could uh discuss more about that and

2830
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:08,400
see how we can

2831
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:11,679
move forward about this idea so if you

2832
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:14,159
are interested please uh

2833
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:15,840
let's have a discussion

2834
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,040
thank you that's

2835
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,840
that's it

2836
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
thanks pringling hannes is coming up to

2837
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,199
the queue

2838
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:26,239
hi bing um hi could you go back to

2839
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:28,159
slides i have a question about the

2840
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:30,719
drawing uh to better understand sort of

2841
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:33,040
the boxes

2842
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,519
so like

2843
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,520
maybe slide five or so

2844
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,199
yeah so this one

2845
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:43,440
so um

2846
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,600
on the on the right hand side

2847
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,119
with the diamond the middleware

2848
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:49,360
repository like that's on the server

2849
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:50,639
side uh

2850
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:53,040
that's the box for the server side the

2851
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,440
app owner is obviously well not

2852
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,480
obviously but

2853
01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:00,639
the app owner is um

2854
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:02,960
that would be a different server before

2855
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,840
with the owner like the human uh

2856
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,440
next to it um

2857
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:10,560
the errors uh what do the errors mean in

2858
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,239
your drawing because they are not

2859
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:13,679
necessarily

2860
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:15,360
are they protocol messages or are they

2861
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,159
uh

2862
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:19,119
what do they represent

2863
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:22,800
or internal information flow

2864
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,880
uh you mean the

2865
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,880
the middleware wrapper is for the

2866
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,119
middleware different middlewares because

2867
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:30,080
in

2868
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:31,599
in different computation computing

2869
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:33,440
architecture there will have be

2870
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:36,560
different middleware to fit into the

2871
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:41,040
heterogeneous architecture of that cpu

2872
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,840
right um so okay um

2873
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,639
if we look at the um the boxes on the

2874
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:48,639
left-hand side uh

2875
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:50,480
like you have the target environment and

2876
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,560
then the hypervisor and cpu firmware

2877
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,199
below is that that is that supposed to

2878
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:58,560
be in one device or

2879
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,679
because there are separate boxes um

2880
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:03,920
yeah that's that's one device that's a

2881
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,520
different layer of

2882
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,560
of a confidential computing resource

2883
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,520
but it's but it's a single device

2884
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:14,400
yes different layers okay so in the the

2885
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,960
green box is that uh

2886
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:19,920
that's in the um

2887
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,800
in the normal world so in the ree

2888
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,800
is that true no no

2889
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,679
the green green box is the trustworth

2890
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:29,520
this is the t

2891
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,920
oh that's the okay application

2892
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:35,920
middleware okay that's okay that's good

2893
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,040
so what i'm trying to uh to say is that

2894
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:42,159
the the black application could just uh

2895
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:44,560
load uh loaded into the targeting

2896
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,960
environment and wizard and it changed it

2897
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,840
could just directly run the application

2898
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,000
without any change of the source code to

2899
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,480
fit into the uh the composition

2900
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:57,280
computing cpu

2901
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,960
okay yeah

2902
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:00,159
okay

2903
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:02,880
uh and the deep the deep broker in in

2904
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,440
many other diagrams it was running on

2905
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,840
the the rich execution environment but

2906
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,679
here you are running it on the

2907
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:12,320
hypervisor uh that and that may be maybe

2908
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,679
a possibility

2909
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:18,480
um so like for example um

2910
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,360
so if i take for example veracruz this

2911
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,840
one uh possible middleware

2912
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,719
uh so the deep age the middleware would

2913
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:30,000
be veracruz uh and the deep agent would

2914
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,040
be somewhere let's say

2915
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,520
where would that be that would probably

2916
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,960
be maybe an option or so um

2917
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,080
and uh the application would be vasom

2918
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,000
running on veracruz is that sort of

2919
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,599
roughly how i i

2920
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:47,599
i should understand it or i think it

2921
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:49,679
would be good to have an

2922
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:53,360
example um on how this is instantiated

2923
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:57,520
to have a uh a good understanding on

2924
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,760
how you would actually turn this into a

2925
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:02,800
working system

2926
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:03,599
here

2927
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:06,080
i think the next slide shows that the

2928
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,320
concept and the instantiation and how

2929
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:11,840
they mapping with each other and

2930
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,639
this is the very

2931
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:17,760
earlier draft of this idea and

2932
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:20,320
maybe there's something incorrect and

2933
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:23,199
this is just the meaning of it i want to

2934
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:24,800
share so

2935
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,520
maybe the mapping is not correct and we

2936
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:28,400
can

2937
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,560
discuss it more about that after the

2938
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,840
meeting i think okay

2939
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:36,159
okay

2940
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:41,199
gary

2941
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:44,839
you're on the queue

2942
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,480
yes thank you this was interesting i i

2943
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,719
can't i i can't claim to fully

2944
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:54,080
understand old aspects here i think

2945
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:56,400
we need to read the draft again maybe

2946
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:59,520
or or have more discussions uh i do of

2947
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,920
course agree that like it's it's super

2948
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,679
useful to have

2949
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,199
these kinds of capabilities that you

2950
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:06,080
could

2951
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:09,280
provide some computing facilities for

2952
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:12,000
applications uh in the network or close

2953
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,360
the network and and uh be able to um

2954
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:17,040
provide at the stations and the

2955
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:20,000
protections that tes can

2956
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,480
can can provide so i think that's good i

2957
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,719
did have a question uh sort of one

2958
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:26,480
detailed question on the

2959
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:28,159
record draft

2960
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:31,040
section six is about the use case

2961
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:34,560
examples and it mentions like vr ar

2962
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,639
applications

2963
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:41,320
and it it does say that

2964
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,320
the applications don't want the

2965
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:45,840
conversation to be

2966
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,760
uh or the network to be aware of their

2967
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,599
conversations

2968
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:51,440
but then it also says that it's hard to

2969
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,920
encrypt all the vr context because of an

2970
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,920
unacceptable cost and i would actually

2971
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,760
argue that that's

2972
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,920
not exactly what i would expect to see i

2973
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:03,119
would expect to see that there's both

2974
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:06,000
protection of the data in transit

2975
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,480
so and that that we can do i think we

2976
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,560
can do that um

2977
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:14,080
and uh also protection of the uh

2978
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:17,280
data in you so this is what we can do

2979
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,760
with confidential computing

2980
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,480
so it's just wondering like if you had

2981
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:23,840
any further

2982
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,599
explanation of this

2983
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:28,560
encryption versus

2984
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:31,440
in that use case i mean that we cannot

2985
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,520
run all the code in the

2986
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,199
encryption type

2987
01:54:35,199 --> 01:54:37,760
i mean a lot of times it's

2988
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:38,960
it will be

2989
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:42,080
executed or processed in a plain text in

2990
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,920
the cpu

2991
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,960
so especially uh you have the tdx

2992
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,599
architecture or some like some

2993
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:51,119
architecture like

2994
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:53,599
memory encryption then you can run your

2995
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:57,280
code in an encryption type

2996
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,520
right yeah maybe it was just that's the

2997
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,360
way that it was written that led me to

2998
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,520
be confused a little bit but i of course

2999
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,360
i agree that you can't always process

3000
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,880
only encrypted data you have to have

3001
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,480
these situations where

3002
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:09,599
where um

3003
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:11,280
you get get to process the actual

3004
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,280
unencrypted data and in order to do that

3005
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,760
safely uh we wrap it inside the

3006
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:17,360
confidence a computing enclave or

3007
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:18,719
something so

3008
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:21,760
yeah i i think i agree with that

3009
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:24,000
yeah yeah yes thank you i will make i

3010
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,800
will revise that for more secure and

3011
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,440
more correctly

3012
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:37,199
any other questions

3013
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:39,839
or comments

3014
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:41,920
nope

3015
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,560
so pengling

3016
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:47,440
ben also noted that there's a computer

3017
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,679
aware network buff

3018
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,760
yes that is scheduled for tomorrow

3019
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:54,560
session one

3020
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:56,239
okay so

3021
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:58,320
thank you you know it may be interesting

3022
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:01,040
for you to share those thoughts in that

3023
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,639
i don't know if there's a mail list but

3024
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:05,520
um in that community as well in that

3025
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:06,960
group

3026
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,199
uh i'm not sure there are

3027
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:11,599
there if they have some time slide to

3028
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:14,560
share the

3029
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,199
material yeah i was just mentioning that

3030
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:18,960
uh the specific

3031
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:20,080
session

3032
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,000
time slot for the canva

3033
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
was the first one on tuesday because i

3034
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,280
think you had mentioned it was either

3035
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,840
tuesday or

3036
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,760
you weren't sure and i just left i think

3037
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,199
i saw yeah

3038
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:34,719
ben i was looking at the um

3039
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,080
at the agenda i think it's tomorrow

3040
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,920
yeah it's tomorrow

3041
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:44,080
yeah yeah thank you so much

3042
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,520
it's better to share in this group

3043
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,520
because it's for the security and the

3044
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:50,320
tip and rest

3045
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:54,159
in fact that i think this idea could not

3046
01:56:54,159 --> 01:56:57,040
only use these in can but also can be

3047
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:01,040
used in any network i think

3048
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:04,400
okay

3049
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,480
unless there's nothing else thank you

3050
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:12,400
for your presentation ping ling and you

3051
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,080
know you can solicit more feedback on

3052
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:16,880
the mail list as well

3053
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:18,159
and i still would encourage you if

3054
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:20,719
there's a mail list for the can um since

3055
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:22,320
there's a buff

3056
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:24,320
that you might solicit feedback from

3057
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,320
that group as well

3058
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,239
okay um

3059
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:31,599
okay uh any orders of business comments

3060
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:33,840
feedback

3061
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,119

thank you

3064

and have a great week at the ipf those

3065
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:44,320
who are here on site

3066
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,400
and hopefully those on on virtual can

3067
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:49,519
get some sleep

3068
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:54,840
thanks everyone

3069
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:22,800
already

3070
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:26,000
thanks for the notes ned

3071
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,199
yeah i have to admit it's a little busy

3072
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:32,639
looking

3073
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:35,040
between the three screens

3074
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:36,400
and my phone

3075
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:39,119
for the time

3076
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:43,080
timer

3077
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:59,920
thank goodness yeah

3078
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,679
but there was a lot of i think there are

3079
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:03,199
some

3080
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:04,400
miss

3081
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:07,040
well dave couldn't hear hank's comments

3082
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,719
directly right

3083
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:10,880
and i think hank was just reacting to

3084
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,119
the text on the slide

3085
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:15,520
because the slide said

3086
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:16,800
something

3087
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:19,119
might copy

3088
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:22,159
right the attestation results which hank

3089
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:24,320
is right unless you have good provenance

3090
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:25,679
then how do you know whether you're

3091
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:26,719
getting

3092
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:30,880
that result the original or a copy

3093
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:33,199
and that the copy hasn't been

3094
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:36,400
fudged right

3095
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:39,679
well it's a question of context it's

3096
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:42,239
question of policy whether the copying

3097
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:45,360
is allowed or not

3098
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:48,080
but i don't know that that's in scope

3099
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,280
for teep

3100
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:52,159
and so my suggestion is

3101
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:54,480
in that scenario it should be listed in

3102
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:57,760
the security considerations of

3103
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:00,400
it would be a violation of the design if

3104
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,960
that were to be allowed meaning

3105
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:05,360
in big letters policy do not allow this

3106
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:06,400
to happen

3107
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,159
right

3108
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:09,679
but if you are going to let it happen

3109
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:11,520
then we need to change the schemas to

3110
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,520
allow for the prominence to come through

3111
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:16,719
i think it wasn't clear if

3112
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:19,599
it was trying to say that

3113
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:21,599
there needs to be a

3114
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:23,199
an exception to

3115
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:28,400
the rats expectation right well so

3116
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:30,800
so on the chat

3117
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:32,000
brendan

3118
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,280
and uh

3119
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,639
dave were saying well nowhere in the

3120
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:36,239
draft do we say

3121
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:38,719
that we you know that a copy is allowed

3122
02:00:38,719 --> 02:00:40,719
or not well now that you let the cat out

3123
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:41,840
of the bag

3124
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:43,360
that's what i'm saying

3125
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,440
and the considerations you need to put

3126
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:48,239
in the design the intent is that you

3127
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:51,040
wouldn't copy

3128
02:00:53,119 --> 02:00:56,000
it's that circular

3129
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,360
that circular thing

3130
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:04,159
[Music]

3131
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:06,239
so i lost about eight minutes trying to

3132
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:09,839
get the meat echo and stuff going

3133
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:12,880
just fyi

3134
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,000
well so

3135
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:26,000
well we started almost 10 minutes late

3136
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:28,800
because i was trying to make sure

3137
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:33,239
remember i was telling you the data
