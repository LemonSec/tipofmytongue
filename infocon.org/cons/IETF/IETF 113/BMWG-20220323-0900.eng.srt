1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,318
improvement of the uh

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,240
of the internet

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,400
so if you've ever if you've ever tested

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,000
something that that connects to the

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,480
internet or is part of the internet

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,000
uh this will probably be interesting to

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,960
you

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
or if you ever look at any of the like

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
marketing materials where

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,359
network vendor says our device does this

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,840
many things per second yeah so um are

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,000
you guys what open source tools are you

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,399
guys using for these measurements or are

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,320
you using open source tools for these

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
so i mean this is mostly writing of the

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
documents

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,320
yeah

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,840
there are some of the tools which are

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,600
open source stuff

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,559
and

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,239
um

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,600
i think actually at the last meeting

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,440
there was some discussion on a tool

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,760

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,359

uh we're a good crowd of people that as

104

uh as you know as testers and and

105

we usually get along pretty well

108
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,720
so um uh here's the note well and and um

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,680
it's a reminder of itf policies in place

110
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,919
uh there's a patent policy

111
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,400
and uh definitions of contribution and

112
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
participation uh please read it

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
carefully and of course

114
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
if you're aware of any itf contribution

115
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
that's covered by patents

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,240
or patent applications uh owned by you

117
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,759
or your sponsor

118
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,600
uh that

119
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,680
and you you must disclose that fact or

120
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,560
not participate and so forth uh you

121
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,080
should have heard this five or six times

122
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,120
by now

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,400
so um

124
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,960
let's uh let's assume that's uh as

125
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,280
written

126
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
okay our agenda here today is uh to talk

127
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,880
about uh status of the working group

128
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,000
drafts

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
um and the working group status in

130
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,880
general

131
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,199
so um we've got a couple of working

132
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,400
group drafts lined up for uh

133
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
presentation and discussion

134
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,639
and then we'll look at uh the draft that

135
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,160
we've been trying to get adopted into

136
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,759
the working group i think we're pretty

137
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,520
close on that there was another email

138
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,000
yet on that again this morning

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
uh we've got a couple of proposals that

140
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
are

141
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,199
been around for a while and then we can

142
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,800
talk about some more

143
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,759
and then

144
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,919
some new proposals

145
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,800
uh

146
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,759
related to segment routing uh mpls and

147
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,759
ipv6 flavors

148
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,880
of sr so that should be exciting

149
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,840
and

150
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
and that's the total agenda today i

151
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,199
think i've got slides for every one of

152
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,360
these now so that's that's a good thing

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520

154
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,960

uh

181
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,080
we'll uh let me move on to the next

182
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,840
thing here here's the working group

183
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,879
status

184
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,759
um

185
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,879
the

186
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,520
evpn draft uh

187
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,759
got a lot of comments and discusses in

188
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,759
iesg review

189
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,880
uh the bottom line is um

190
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
the authors tried to

191
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,559
get to a point where they were

192
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,200
addressing uh the comments

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,799
but no new file was was ever submitted

194
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
and um

195
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,399
you know they sort of sort of claimed

196
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,800
that they were looking for uh one author

197
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
was looking for approval of the other

198
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,640
and then everyone disappeared

199
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,480
so uh we

200
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
set deadlines we last tested other

201
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
people uh take up the work

202
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
um basically no response

203
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,399
so this is officially status dead now

204
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,040
and um sad to see that a lot of work

205
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,640
went into it but that's the way it goes

206
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,959
um next generation firewall benchmarking

207
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,240
we're hearing a lot more about that

208
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
today

209
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,279
they're working hard to discuss to

210
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,560
resolve the discuss ballots and um

211
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,120
one of those is going to require a uh

212
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,519
transport area review request again and

213
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,839
then tommy paulie is is going to be the

214
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,519
target for that since he reviewed it the

215
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,839
first time around

216
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,240
multiple loss ratio search has uh had a

217
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,880
large rewrite sort of in progress

218
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,560
uh we're still working on that yang

219
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,600
model

220
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,240
and that resolving that objection and as

221
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
i said proposals keep coming

222
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,640
no new rfcs this time we got a nice

223
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,279
stable charter which is fantastic

224
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,399
and we've got a supplementary bmw

225
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,519
webpage that tells you how to join up so

226
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,800
glad to

227
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,880
share that link with you all

228
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
um milestones

229
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,120
uh the one thing i'm really bad at as

230
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,360
chair is uh keeping milestones up to

231
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,320
date

232
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,000
uh so

233
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,120
they're not

234
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
um you know i think

235
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
we we usually somebody usually takes an

236
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,000
action item out of the meeting to uh

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,720
propose new milestones oh hey sarah you

238
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,399
got your audio going

239
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,000
you noticed yeah and i'll take the

240
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,480
action actually to uh go through and

241
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,880
update milestones with you afterwards ah

242
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
thank you good morning all

243
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
good morning glad you got the audio

244
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,800
going there

245
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,079
fantastic

246
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,480
thank you

247
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
all right

248
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,399
all right so i think

249
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,240
uh yeah that's it that's it for the

250
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
chair slides any questions on the status

251
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440
of the working group

252
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,040
cool

253
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,480
all right

254
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,600
uh then um

255
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,720
let me

256
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,560
i guess i stopped this right

257
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,279
and then

258
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,880
i started up again

259
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
with a new deck of slides

260
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,120
and that's this one

261
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,640
and

262
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,600
hopefully you guys can see the new deck

263
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,480
for the

264
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
multiple loss ratio search

265
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,360
and that means we're looking for uh

266
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,839
ratco to uh

267
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,720
step up to the virtual microphone and

268
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,519
give us a short presentation here so uh

269
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,240
please go ahead branco

270
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,360
hi so uh this is my presentation uh

271
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,160
updated uh there are

272
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,360
it is a

273
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,320
like

274
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,399
similar to the draft it is in the middle

275
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,560
of the regret so there should be less

276
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,839
details than previously but maybe more

277
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,760
things to discuss so we will see how it

278
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,600
goes

279
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,120
sounds good

280
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,279
i'm moving on to slide two

281
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,959
yeah yeah

282
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,279
so

283
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,880
the previous versions of the draft were

284
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,839
trying to describe multiple goals and

285
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,560
multiple ways to achieve those goals and

286
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,920
the text was

287
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,279
too interconnected and hard to parse so

288
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,920
we are doing a rewrite trying to

289
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,720
explicitly state different goals and

290
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,800
explicitly state different

291
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,920
parts of the solution of what we are

292
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,120
proposing and

293
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
discuss what is possible

294
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,880
on the smaller areas before

295
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
putting it all together

296
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
also we are trying to get rid of

297
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,680
the terminology we are

298
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,760
we were using in the previous versions

299
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,120
uh

300
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,240
names like

301
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,120
ndr and pdr non drop plate that

302
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,360
partial drop rate which is not the

303
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
official terminology so where possible

304
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,200
we are trying to use

305
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
terminology present

306
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,000
in previous rfcs

307
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,880
and

308
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
yeah so we were starting this rewrite

309
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,560
but we realized that it is way more work

310
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,680
than we

311
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,040
allowed our the time for us so this is

312
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,160
the progress

313
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,079
but

314
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,560
for anybody interested

315
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,920
i think it is a worth a read

316
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,399
so next slide please

317
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,680
okay

318
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,720
uh

319
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,639
this is uh just

320
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,920
you can see uh

321
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
this is an old slide i have already i

322
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,160
have only updated the links basically

323
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,440
this is

324
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,160
describing an algorithm that we are

325
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,160
already using for quite a few years and

326
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,440
we are doing

327
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
small improvements to it

328
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,279
but yeah basically this is like code

329
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,880
first approach

330
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,519
and maybe this is uh why

331
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,760
the draft currently is more complicated

332
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,320
than if it was like more theoretical

333
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,839
work

334
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,320
next slide

335
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,880
please okay so this is uh like a very

336
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,920
quick overview so try to highlight uh

337
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,120
the

338
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,639
main ideas

339
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,360
the one important idea is to search not

340
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,680
only for throughput which is the load

341
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,680
that achieves zero loss but also

342
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,800
various loads that achieve

343
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,240
a specific ratio of loss

344
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,279
it is

345
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,720
motivated by

346
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,399
some duties

347
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,880
behavior basically when you are trying

348
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,279
to search for this throughput the

349
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,360
results are not very consistent

350
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,040
basically it is possible to start two

351
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,279
trial measurements at the same load and

352
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,199
one of them gets zero loss and the other

353
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,399
one doesn't

354
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,560
so

355
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,959
you want to formalize this

356
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,839
so it is for some types of duties it is

357
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,440
also interesting

358
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,240
to

359
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,440
find for this load that achieves some

360
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
non-zero ratio because

361
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,560
this

362
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
result is more stable

363
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
and

364
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,480
one of the main

365
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
motivations

366
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,320
for our approach is to save time while

367
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,199
doing the the search so there are

368
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,399
multiple

369
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,800
like i can call it tricks that can be

370
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,240
applied uh all of them are related to

371
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,759
the way the load for the next trial

372
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,120
is selected

373
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,800
also duration because it is possible to

374
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,920
use short iterations

375
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,360
and

376
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,079
yeah uh one more thing

377
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,759
maybe you can go to the next slide i'm

378
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,600
not sure where

379
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,240
where i put it okay so it is not there

380
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,519
alright i will go back to it uh

381
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,639
there are some requirements uh that are

382
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
kind of implicitly present already in

383
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,440
rfc 2544

384
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
but they are not

385
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,800
stated as explicitly as needed this is

386
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
mostly related to the discussion we had

387
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,440
on the mailing list and also on these

388
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,880
meetings

389
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,650
one big requirement is that

390
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,040
[Music]

391
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,959
how is it called test equipment has to

392
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,279
be reliable basically if you want to

393
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,480
start

394
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
a trial with some

395
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,320
load that this

396
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,279
equipment should be able to really

397
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,800
put as many

398
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,079
frames in the about its time as is

399
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,399
required because we know that

400
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,519
for some setups the the this equipment

401
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,120
can struggle to

402
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,399
achieve high enough load and

403
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,279
this is not addressed in the rfc 254 but

404
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,000
of course it is very important and there

405
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,360
are

406
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,040
other rfcs that are already describing

407
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,079
basically difference between intended

408
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,199
load and

409
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,720
offered load

410
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
and we want to

411
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
make the language of

412
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,520
our draft to use those terms and make it

413
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,559
clear

414
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,799
that this equipment has to be ridable

415
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,599
and

416
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,599
if it is known that

417
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,880
it is only reliable up to some load it

418
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,000
is

419
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,400
for the

420
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
testing group or

421
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
the person

422
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,480
realizing those tests to ensure that

423
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,960
the test equipment never

424
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
attempts to

425
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,760
send more loans than it is able to do

426
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,480
and

427
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,440
there is

428
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,280
like a side question of

429
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,120
how do you know how much your test

430
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
equipment is able to do which is another

431
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,440
kind of worms

432
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,840
our draft is uh not

433
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,400
planning to offer a solution for those

434
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,960
kind of questions we just want to

435
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,559
make it

436
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,280
explicit that this is work required and

437
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,760
leave it to the people how do they

438
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,320
achieve that

439
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
also another thing that was not

440
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,080
presented rfc to 544 is any search top

441
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,160
criteria basically

442
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,039
it only says you

443
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,520
either increase or decrease

444
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,360
the load for the next trial but it

445
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,360
doesn't tell you when you can stop

446
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,160
so in our mlr search we are also

447
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,919
proposing some search stop criteria

448
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,760
next slide please

449
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,080
okay

450
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,520
okay this is the real example

451
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
uh

452
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,480
basically

453
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,520
some of you

454
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,919
are have already seen similar

455
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,320
presentations so this is not news to you

456
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
this is here just for people that are

457
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,520
maybe new

458
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,160
so they can see

459
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,640
how does it work in real life

460
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,320
and

461
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,200
i will

462
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,280
if there are questions i can go back

463
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,280
here and describe what is going on but

464
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
just looking at the bold numbers you can

465
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,200
see that there are

466
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,880
more

467
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
trials aimed to

468
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,039
examine the ndr so zero loss ratio

469
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,720
and less

470
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,200
trials able to

471
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,440
search for pdr

472
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,200
next slide please

473
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,440
and that that pdr is the partial drop

474
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
ratio right yes

475
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,400
and uh as usual it is more stable

476
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,799
there are less surprises during the

477
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,200
search

478
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,240
in the ndr lower column when you see n

479
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
slash a that means that

480
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
we have

481
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
increased the duration repeated the the

482
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,160
measurement with the same load that

483
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,880
worked before but now it didn't work

484
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,320
basically the same load increase

485
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,720
duration now we have non-zero number of

486
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,280
laws and we have to start doing the

487
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,799
external search to

488
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,679
find low enough load that

489
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,000
achieves zero loss and then continue

490
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,440
bisecting to

491
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,960
get to the required position

492
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,520
and and you've got four phases here this

493
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
uh initialization

494
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,640
uh

495
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,159
in one into and final

496
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,760
and uh

497
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,480
and then of course your your uh final

498
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,640
results come out in that

499
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,559
in that final phase

500
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,520
uh and these are the

501
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,480
these are sort of your precision on the

502
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,240
uh on the uh

503
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,679
ndr offered load

504
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,480
here at the bottom

505
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,840
yeah basically so

506
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,799
you can see uh for example that the

507
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,039
final trial duration is uh 30 seconds

508
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,960
and not 60 years required but by rfc 254

509
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,919
this is

510
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,840
our team deciding

511
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,159
saving more time is more important than

512
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,919
be fully compliant

513
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,280
uh but

514
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,000
yeah basically we have our position goal

515
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,840
i think it is half a percent

516
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,159
uh okay this is a rounded value so you

517
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,559
cannot verify it but basically that is

518
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,880
it and

519
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
so for these values it is basically

520
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,799
uh

521
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,440
0.01

522
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,159
mega packets per second i believe that

523
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,919
is and you can see that for the

524
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,200
iteration two it is uh

525
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
higher and it iteration it is even

526
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
higher so there are some

527
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,679
clever tricks to really try to do as few

528
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,600
uh well

529
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,320
to spend as few seconds as possible for

530
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,840
the search

531
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
in this particular situation the duty

532
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,360
was not

533
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,600
very stable you can see that for one

534
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,440
second trials

535
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,840
five point seven eight was enough but

536
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
for five seconds

537
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,440
we needed to lower

538
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,840
point six and for 30 seconds 5.26

539
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,120
so

540
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,440
there is something going on on the duty

541
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,799
that is causing occasional drops and if

542
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,280
you have longer duration it is more

543
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,000
probable for the drops to happen even if

544
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,919
the mold is otherwise

545
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,440
quite small

546
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,640
right right

547
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,480
so that so you know those are the

548
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,640
interrupts we're dealing with that um

549
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,159
you know we can't get rid of the

550
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,880
virtualized environment uh they're

551
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,960
they're happening for system

552
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
uh functions that are

553
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,080
stirring for health

554
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,158
so uh you know we gotta work around that

555
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,720
well

556
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,280
walk around uh this is a benchmarking so

557
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,960
we have to accept

558
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,679
whatever barrier

559
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,200
and absolutely

560
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,559
absolutely

561
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,159
but this is like one of the examples why

562
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,760
we are

563
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,360
choosing some values that are maybe not

564
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,679
not obvious because this is an example

565
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,320
of the search that takes

566
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,720
longer than the usual in ideal case you

567
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,600
need only four measurements

568
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,679
at 30 seconds and now you can see there

569
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,760
are way more than the four measurements

570
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,039
so this is

571
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,480
spending some time

572
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,640
so

573
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,760
we were

574
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,520
like trying to find good values that

575
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,039
are

576
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,159
resulting in fast search time even if

577
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,320
the dod behavior is

578
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,000
not as nice

579
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,600
right

580
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,880
okay

581
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,640
okay so we can go to the next slide

582
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,200
uh yeah this is a

583
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,080
basically me inventing a numbers just to

584
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,480
get to a scenario that is interested

585
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,600
interesting

586
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,360
uh so

587
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,919
if you can find it there are

588
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,120
well

589
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,760
one cell with two red numbers and the

590
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,240
other cell with a 100 number

591
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
basically the

592
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,400
situation with the two word numbers is

593
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,520
uh

594
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,000
similar than before and now for pdr

595
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,919
lower bound we have repeated the

596
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,000
measurement and

597
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,159
instead of an a i have

598
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,279
written

599
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,640
the

600
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
ndr upper bound

601
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,279
and basically one of the

602
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,799
not well one of the questions with no

603
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,200
obvious answer is what should be the

604
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,760
offered load

605
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,039
there

606
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,600
in this particular

607
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,720
example i have chosen the 20

608
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,120
to be the next offered load uh which

609
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,559
well

610
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,440
let me

611
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,559
talk about it

612
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,880
one more time uh so the

613
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,799
third line from the bottom

614
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,200
we have

615
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,559
measurement at 17 and the measurement at

616
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,400
22.

617
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,840
one of them

618
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,279
is valid pdr low bound the other one is

619
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,480
a valid video upper bound but

620
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,559
this lower bound

621
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,400
is not coming

622
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,559
logically from

623
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,799
the previous search around pdr it is

624
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,320
just that

625
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,480
ndr upper bound

626
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,360
x

627
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,640
as a pdr lower bound and we have nothing

628
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,520
better

629
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
what we had better was invalidated

630
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,840
so the question is

631
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,440
what should we choose

632
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,760
as the next load

633
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,080
to get to the pdr

634
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,559
uh one possibility is just okay you have

635
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,640
lower bound you have upper bound even if

636
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,159
they are far apart you can do the

637
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,279
bisection

638
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,279
another reasoning is that

639
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,880
you have

640
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,559
new uh pdr upper bound and you have

641
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,640
old pdr upper bound

642
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,440
like a second titus at the

643
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,480
64 second measurement and you can do

644
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,679
external search from there

645
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,720
and uh well maybe even another approach

646
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,760
is that if on this re-measurement uh

647
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,720
the

648
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,840
22 value has failed maybe it is a signal

649
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,720
that the pdr will be closer to the ndr

650
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,360
so maybe we can continue

651
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
external search from the

652
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,960
ndr values like 16 17 okay so let's uh

653
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,039
try knighted so

654
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,559
there are multiple

655
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,080
choices

656
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,039
and it is not the obvious uh what is the

657
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,720
best approach

658
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,840
in

659
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,960
perhaps

660
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,760
in practice uh it may depend uh on your

661
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,559
uh experience like what do you expect of

662
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,240
your duty would you

663
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,559
imagine that the period lower bound will

664
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,480
be at 64 seconds

665
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,039
but of course

666
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,240
if you want to specify the

667
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,559
algorithm it has to be deterministic

668
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,400
well

669
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,440
right maybe now i can talk about it one

670
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,400
of the goals of the smaller search is to

671
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,840
make this

672
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,240
load selection deterministic

673
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,960
because if you do not have deterministic

674
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,200
load selection you

675
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
have

676
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,159
you do not have as

677
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,039
high

678
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,279
repeatability of the result basically if

679
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,039
you run the search once maybe you run

680
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,360
the search second time of course you can

681
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,600
get a different result just because the

682
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,919
otp has differently but sometimes you

683
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,640
can

684
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,600
get different results if you use

685
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,679
similar but not exactly the same

686
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,760
algorithms

687
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,360
basically

688
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,600
in this

689
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,559
case

690
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,520
whether

691
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
the

692
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,679
next load is 20 or 19

693
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,799
maybe

694
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,679
if you do simulations and repeat it

695
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,840
many times you can see that you get a

696
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,880
different distribution of the results

697
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,480
of course

698
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,039
this is only affecting

699
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,559
devices that are not deterministic

700
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,960
but yeah as we have seen

701
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,919
there are quite many devices that are

702
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,159
not deterministic and one of my goals is

703
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,080
to have something that

704
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,120
gives us small standard deviation when

705
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,039
you run the same search on the same

706
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,360
device multiple times as possible while

707
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,200
still having a

708
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,480
small

709
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,799
total duration

710
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,200
so rocco i think i'm i'm struggling with

711
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,039
two things here

712
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,159
first

713
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,840
and i'll i'll take up the majority of

714
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,760
this feedback to the list

715
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,159
the slides and what you're seeing don't

716
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,000
match and they really need the color and

717
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,919
context of what you're seeing if i were

718
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,559
to look at these later on my own without

719
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,480
the commentary or without looking at the

720
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,760
video i'm not sure these things hold

721
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,440
if i just look at the side here i don't

722
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,799
exactly know what it's telling me

723
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,200
without you explaining it so thank you

724
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,640
for explaining it

725
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,159
but i'll take some of this feedback to

726
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,159
the list because i think it's just stuff

727
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,320
that helps me um

728
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,000
make sense of the slides afterwards and

729
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,559
it's editorial so i'll take that there

730
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,240
with the comment that you just made i'm

731
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,520
a little

732
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,840
confused as to how this would

733
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,360
with just the comment that you made that

734
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,840
hey even if the device under test is fed

735
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,919
the same load

736
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,440
you're going to get different results

737
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,000
every time if the device is not

738
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,159
deterministic

739
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,480
i'm not sure

740
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,720
tailoring an algorithm to give you the

741
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,960
smallest standard deviation

742
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,200
makes like i'm not sure what the value

743
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,880
is because at that point if the device

744
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
isn't deterministic

745
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,159
it is what it is

746
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,320
um and and i'm not sure why you would

747
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
want to

748
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,480
try to artificially reduce the standard

749
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,120
dvd the spread on the standard deviation

750
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,360
there

751
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,679
well yeah

752
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,039
so

753
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,559
one thing is

754
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,799
that

755
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,720
this whole search takes time and

756
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,840
you want to run multiple tests so you do

757
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,559
not really have time to repeat

758
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,240
the search

759
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,440
and

760
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,039
sometimes you see from the results like

761
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,480
you change the duration you get a

762
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,559
different

763
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,919
loss rate loss ratio then this is that

764
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,000
is a proof that the dot is not that

765
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,520
mystic but sometimes you get compatible

766
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,840
result in your one search

767
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,559
and you do not see that it was uh

768
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,159
not guaranteed

769
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,520
so it is very hard to tell just from

770
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,960
single search that duty is deterministic

771
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,399
so

772
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,000
you will get

773
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,880
devices and basically

774
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,960
you do not know if it is deterministic

775
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,559
or not

776
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,799
if it is deterministic that uh

777
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,880
it doesn't matter this details that i'm

778
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,799
talking about but if it is not

779
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,519
deterministic

780
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,279
you are still facing the question if

781
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
different group measured

782
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,960
the same device with the same test

783
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,039
equipment and the same such algorithm

784
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,679
will they get

785
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,640
the same or at this close result or not

786
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,360
and

787
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,279
this is where

788
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,559
i think it is good idea to design the

789
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,320
algorithm to

790
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,080
at least increase the probability of the

791
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,519
results being close together

792
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,919
i'm not sure how important it is

793
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,840
it's it's

794
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
i you know taking up from sarah's point

795
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,760
it's it's important to uh make the table

796
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,080
uh sort of wide enough and the column

797
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,120
headings

798
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,200
uh

799
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,559
um

800
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,559
useful enough to describe

801
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,440
uh

802
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,159
both of the numbers in each column

803
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,039
or or just put a key to that someplace

804
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,559
and and um

805
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,399
you know i would observe that if this

806
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,919
was real data and you had uh 64 second

807
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,840
uh

808
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,600
duration uh trials

809
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,559
um those would be really hard to

810
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,640
uh make deterministic

811
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,559
uh you know sort of in the face of the

812
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,960
transients that we're seeing in the

813
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,679
uh

814
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,360
you know virtualized

815
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
networking world these days

816
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,720
so um

817
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
and but i think that's the same that's

818
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
the same kind of thing that you

819
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,799
encountered at 30 seconds and

820
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,320
and so forth so

821
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,000
um you know i i i encourage you to think

822
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,799
about

823
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,519
uh the transients and the

824
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,279
and the um

825
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,360
steady state performance

826
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
uh which is what exists in between the

827
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
transients

828
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,159
perhaps in in in different ways

829
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,200
um

830
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,159
you'll i think you'll find that

831
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,919
that that might help

832
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,480
it might help to add some determinism

833
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
and you may need to repeat trials too

834
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,720
the same same sort of way that we did

835
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,240
with uh

836
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,120
the binary search with loss verification

837
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,080
uh i mean that's been a that's been a

838
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,519
a valuable

839
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,399
uh

840
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,240
addition to a tried and true search

841
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,240
algorithm uh to repeat trials at uh at a

842
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,039
duration in between transients uh you

843
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,039
know once we figured out what that uh

844
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,559
typically is

845
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,399
so um you know

846
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,960
as you're searching for quote quote

847
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,360
determinism here and and trying to make

848
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,600
the algorithm deterministic think along

849
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,760
those lines too i i think that might

850
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
help

851
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
yeah well basically it's a

852
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,399
part of

853
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,399
that reasoning went

854
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,039
into our other draft plr search

855
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,640
that is aimed specifically for devices

856
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,919
that can be

857
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,679
deterministic and

858
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,279
but yeah that is

859
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,320
that is

860
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,679
not even close to being finished so

861
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,079
we do not expect wide adoption there but

862
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,440
uh this uh this is just

863
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,839
making rfc two five four four and making

864
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,918
uh throughput

865
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,159
like more strict the starter algorithm

866
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,760
more speaks so that the results

867
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,839
are coming faster and

868
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,480
if possible

869
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
they are repeatable

870
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,040
right right so i guess the best thing to

871
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,879
do is uh you know

872
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,199
as as sarah says let's try to make the

873
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,280
the tables you're producing clear

874
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,440
and uh maybe let's and let's look at

875
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,599
some results together on the list and

876
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,839
see what we can say about those

877
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,918
yeah definitely if you have uh specific

878
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,679
questions

879
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,520
right to the list and i will reply

880
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,440
basically i was thinking about

881
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,960
describing the current uh

882
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,000
load selection because basically showing

883
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,880
the

884
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,400
six values that are considered

885
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,160
the tightest lower bound second that is

886
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,839
lower bound that is upper bound seconds

887
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,160
tightest upper bound and

888
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,920
tightest lower bound from previous

889
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,240
duration and tightest upper bound from

890
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,560
previous duration only those

891
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,040
six at most six values

892
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,720
are considered and then there is some

893
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,760
logic that

894
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,079
computes something and decides

895
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,640
what will be the next load but uh i

896
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,240
figured that

897
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,520
first of all

898
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,079
it is likely to be changed for another

899
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,839
draft version

900
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,079
there were

901
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,720
review comments

902
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,320
i think mainly from

903
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,760
vladimir that it may be more useful to

904
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,040
finish searching from ndr before

905
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,200
starting a search for pdr

906
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,200
and yeah currently i think that yes in

907
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,920
some cases it can save some time at the

908
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,599
cost of

909
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,599
me not being sure what the

910
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,480
correct

911
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,040
note selection rules will be i expect

912
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,200
that will be slightly more complicated

913
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,560
yeah basically i'm reading here

914
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,760
but

915
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,079
yeah and the other thing is that it will

916
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,040
take

917
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,839
i believe too much time for me to even

918
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,119
go through that

919
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,280
here while talking about

920
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,200
so uh what you see in

921
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,560
these slides

922
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,400
yeah it is like very condensed

923
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,920
information it doesn't make sense

924
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,760
without my commentary but i haven't

925
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,079
found a good way to put all the required

926
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,160
commentary on the slide

927
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,399
right

928
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,760
yeah when the logic is

929
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,920
on the list i don't i didn't mean to uh

930
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,320
disrupt your your flow today so i'll

931
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,079
take those comments to the list and

932
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,040
thank you for considering them um i

933
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,520
appreciate that

934
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,640
all right

935
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,480
so these are the these are the next

936
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,040
steps i think we've got this now uh with

937
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,560
some good examples

938
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,640
and um

939
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,280
is that pretty much it frecko

940
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,760
oh yes i think that's

941
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,079
well next to the last light so that's

942
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,280
all for me

943
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,480
okay

944
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,720
thank you

945
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,480
all right

946
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,800
incidentally i i've uh i've put our uh

947
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,359
agenda into the uh

948
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,160
the

949
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,359
hedgehog the hedgehog note paper thing

950
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,560
and

951
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,079
we can

952
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,320
just add some add some notes in there

953
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,920
for our minutes

954
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,079
as we go along

955
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,359
all right

956
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,960
so let's see what's next

957
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,279
here we go

958
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,280

to uh present these uh please go ahead

965
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,040
thanks guys for putting the slides

966
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,800
together

967
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,359
all right um next slide uh

968
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,598
okay

969
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,839
all right so essentially uh

970
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,839
the draft is at the point where

971
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,079
it's gone through the area director

972
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,640
review and we got

973
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,960
a significant amount of uh feedback um

974
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,160
so

975
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,560
we have uh

976
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,079
we received discuss uh submissions from

977
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,720
uh five different uh participants

978
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,880
totaling an eight uh total number of

979
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,720
eight eight uh eight submissions that

980
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,640
we've got to work through

981
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,520
we come to a resolution uh for five of

982
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,599
them that are going to be proposed we're

983
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,720
um

984
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,400
looking at the remaining three and uh

985
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,520
two uh submitters were lars edgar and uh

986
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,599
benjamin cadduck

987
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,000
the um

988
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,640
the the submission the submissions were

989
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,879
uh

990
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,599
interesting and uh we believe that we

991
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,480
have uh uh have uh have good solutions

992
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,800
but we are struggling a bit with with uh

993
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
how to respond to lars and uh and

994
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,640
benjamin but we're working through that

995
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,800
i think warren was uh

996
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,200
had a question or comment

997
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,280
yeah go ahead warren

998
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,119
thank you yeah just a quick note that it

999
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,560
seems like you have everything under

1000
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,400
control you know it seems the

1001
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,079
conversations are happening and i've

1002
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,000
been staying out of it but let me know

1003
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,800
if you know i should be doing more but

1004
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,920
it looks like the conversations are

1005
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,440
happening and you're all coming up with

1006
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,200
great answers so

1007
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,160
um yeah it's um the the

1008
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,320
definitely is that but this is saying

1009
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,000
it's under control i think it's a bit

1010
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,079
generous but um

1011
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,440
but

1012
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,040
thank you thank you for that

1013
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,079
um

1014
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,200
so next uh next uh slide out

1015
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,160
i'll i'll just mention here that um

1016
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,040
ben cadeck is uh i think he's

1017
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,200
stepping down from the iesg this time

1018
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,000
around and and i'm being replaced

1019
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,079
so i think there's going to be a little

1020
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,200
bit of uh

1021
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,839
uh changeover there as well

1022
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,079
uh but what happened what happens in

1023
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,240
that case with his uh

1024
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,520
his uh

1025
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,839
discuss points do they just go away

1026
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,240
um no i i don't think so i think what

1027
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,119
what could happen is that uh uh ben's

1028
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,240
replacement uh might pick up his discuss

1029
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,280
and then and then do his own review uh

1030
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,040
but i think uh warren's gonna help me

1031
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,880
out with that go ahead warren

1032
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,440
yeah so the incoming ad takes over the

1033
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,240
outgoing ones points

1034
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,760
but

1035
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,240
they may be less

1036
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,319
um

1037
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,680
not going to say invested in the

1038
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,799
document but they may be

1039
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
because they have a different opinion

1040
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,560
yeah

1041
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,040
yeah thank you

1042
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,640
and i and i didn't

1043
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,480
even even from what ben said i didn't

1044
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,400
think that uh that his

1045
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,000
his comments were

1046
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,160
you know it was sort of like uh you know

1047
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,400
i mostly have a question here uh but i

1048
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,640
want to see it answered kind of thing

1049
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,839
so um yeah and it's just a matter of of

1050
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,119
making sure that we give him an

1051
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,280
appropriate answer and understanding the

1052
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,599
interconnections

1053
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,920
resulting from the answer and how it

1054
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,760
could affect the rest of the document

1055
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:44,800
good

1056
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,839
good

1057
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,200
okay

1058
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,560
all right next one

1059
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,880
yep

1060
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,119
so um

1061
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,079
this is

1062
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,440
the lion's share of the issues um

1063
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,520
six we there's 69 comments um 66 we've

1064
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,200
come up with a path

1065
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,000
to it to address them um

1066
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
you know we do appreciate all the effort

1067
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,160
that is that has gone into the reviews

1068
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,880
um i you know definitely have it's going

1069
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,640
to improve uh

1070
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,880
improve things significantly i believe

1071
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,839
um

1072
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,680
there's three remaining um

1073
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,160
comments that we need to uh come up with

1074
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,640
the solution on our on our side

1075
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,599
i'm sure you can appreciate that um

1076
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,319
69 comments alone

1077
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,720
isn't a true representation of

1078
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,359
of the impact um because you know when

1079
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,119
you make one change to the document you

1080
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,040
have to sort of like trace it through

1081
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,720
the rest of the document and make sure

1082
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,640
that uh that there aren't any

1083
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,680
contradictions introduced and and so on

1084
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,040
and also we're

1085
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,599
we're doing our level best to ensure

1086
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,359
that um

1087
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,280
that most of the changes we make are

1088
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,920
going to be editorial and won't impact

1089
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,520
um in a significant manner the actual um

1090
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,240
uh performance testing requirements

1091
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,400
so that's uh that's that's where we're

1092
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,440
working at

1093
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,000
uh next slide

1094
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,079
so

1095
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,400
this is

1096
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,560
this is this is an area that we're we're

1097
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,240
really struggling

1098
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,959
with um

1099
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,280
someone

1100
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,160
raise a comment about um

1101
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,920
you know

1102
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,040
about

1103
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,400
the um

1104
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,319
over abundant use of the word or or the

1105
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,160
action should

1106
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,079
um you know throughout the document and

1107
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,040
i must i'm i must agree that um there

1108
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,400
was a

1109
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,560
significant number in in there and when

1110
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,079
i when i

1111
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,839
went through them um with uh with bala

1112
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,880
um realized that a lot of the shoulds

1113
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,520
were us just trying to be polite

1114
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,119
and um

1115
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,359
yes sir like who are we just to sort of

1116
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,000
dictate you know you know there might be

1117
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,960
scenarios that we would

1118
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,319
consider

1119
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,640
um

1120
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,319
you know a must under normal

1121
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,480
circumstances but something could happen

1122
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,560
that would

1123
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,920
make it sort of yeah no not really and

1124
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,440
we thought well let's just make it a

1125
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,200
should not really

1126
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,160
thinking about how this would play out

1127
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,160
um within the ietf and how precise

1128
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,279
documents like this

1129
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,119
should be

1130
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,240
um

1131
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,920
you know so

1132
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,839
in in the spirit of that we went through

1133
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,520
it and um

1134
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,920
there clearly are a number of shoulds in

1135
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,800
there that will just change to must

1136
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,599
but

1137
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,440
where i'm having the biggest issue is

1138
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,319
the suggestion that um if you're going

1139
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,079
to use a should you need to explain why

1140
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,359
it has to be

1141
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,560
should instead of a must and and

1142
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,359
i i did some reviews of you know and

1143
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,520
this was totally unscientific but some

1144
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,680
reviews of other rfcs

1145
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,079
and i don't really see any significant

1146
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,000
um

1147
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,079
statements along those lines and in

1148
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,119
other rfcs now just because it's not

1149
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,200
anywhere else doesn't mean

1150
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,040
that it um

1151
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,640
shouldn't

1152
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,200
shouldn't be um something that we do in

1153
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,119
this one but

1154
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,440
i i i kind of have a hard time

1155
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,480
embracing that right now simply because

1156
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,839
this has ietf wide implications and

1157
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,000
you know this is going to significantly

1158
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,400
impede the progress of of of the draft

1159
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,240
so i'm i'm

1160
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,240
you know i'm concerned about that

1161
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,359
yeah right i i'm working with you on

1162
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,720
that and and um i think that

1163
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,119
you know the the real test

1164
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,640
process in my mind is uh

1165
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,240
where you where you believe you've been

1166
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,960
polite and you can't come up with

1167
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,079
you can't come

1168
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,359
come easily to a reason why there's a

1169
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,560
legitimate

1170
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,880
um

1171
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,800
sort of

1172
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,000
reason

1173
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,599
not to do the

1174
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,280
uh the requirement then it probably uh

1175
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,880
should have been a must or a shall

1176
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,319
i'm kind of jumping the queue here i

1177
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,240
heard sarah and and i know warren's in

1178
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,960
the queue go ahead sarah

1179
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,280
yeah no i i agree with al like on one

1180
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,520
hand brian i get that uh you probably

1181
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,280
don't want me on the isg because i

1182
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,040
really agree with that comment and i

1183
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,599
really agree with your observation that

1184
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,520
yeah it doesn't clearly it doesn't mean

1185
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,119
it's ubiquitously

1186
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,000
applied across all of the ietf and some

1187
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
drafts or rfcs are better written than

1188
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,079
others i totally agree with that

1189
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,760
but i also agree with what i was saying

1190
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,000
that look if you go through and you're

1191
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,599
eyeballing them and you can't really

1192
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,240
sort of identify hey why is this a

1193
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,960
then i i think i was absolutely in the

1194
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,800
zip code well maybe it shouldn't be a

1195
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,560
must or maybe it should be sure you know

1196
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,079
you sort that out

1197
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,640
the other thing though uh brian is

1198
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,480
it struck me as when you were walking

1199
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,040
through the your talk track there

1200
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,119
i'm not sure you have to literally

1201
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,119
account for every single should or must

1202
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,040
in the document because to your point

1203
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,440
some of these could be look under normal

1204
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,480
circumstances a lot of these things are

1205
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,319
would be musts and you would absolutely

1206
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,400
do them but we put them as should

1207
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,880
because we recognize that there could be

1208
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,599
situations in which you would want to

1209
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,839
totally change that anybody who's ever

1210
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,920
done testing understands and sometimes

1211
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,240
totally goes against what a draft says

1212
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,800
or an rfc says because we have something

1213
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,280
in our environment that that says yeah i

1214
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,960
get that that's probably normal for

1215
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,040
everybody else but right now i have this

1216
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,119
new use case and it's changed

1217
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,880
so the other thing is you could handle a

1218
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,280
bunch of your shirts or your musts with

1219
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,359
that sort of broad brush to say look our

1220
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,440
guidance is in normal

1221
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,040
um

1222
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,200
circumstances here's how we see the

1223
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
world but we accept that there are times

1224
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,079
where

1225
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,920
you might not be in that situation and

1226
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,400
so you know it's okay to do this and i'm

1227
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,800
wondering if that would alleviate the

1228
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,040
the need to address specifically at

1229
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,440
least at least 110 shids in your draft

1230
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,920
do you think so uh sir that that um that

1231
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,160
scenario that you just outlined which

1232
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,680
makes sense um we could could uh easily

1233
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,079
be addressed with um

1234
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,559
with a short you know paragraph on that

1235
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,000
topic um at the top of the rfc

1236
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
yeah that's that's exactly what i would

1237
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,319
expect to see for sure okay

1238
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,240
let's go ahead warren i think i

1239
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,839
used the power of the cheromite there to

1240
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,079
cut the line sorry about that no no

1241
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,760
worries i mean i'm

1242
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,520
just an eq like anyone else

1243
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,559
um

1244
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,160
so yeah

1245
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,040
um

1246
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,319
i don't think that you really need to

1247
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,640
address you know each and every one of

1248
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,760
the shows i think it's worth going

1249
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,040
through and be like yeah this one seems

1250
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,119
reasonable this one doesn't i also don't

1251
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,760
know that you can entirely solve the

1252
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,040
concern by just saying you know putting

1253
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,920
a disclaimer at the top being like well

1254
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,680
these shoulds are

1255
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,200
there in case you want to change your

1256
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,400
mind

1257
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,480
what i think you can probably do is some

1258
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,720
of the uppercase shoulds maybe could be

1259
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,200
better done with lowercase shirts

1260
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,880
um

1261
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,480
but also you know

1262
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,599
if they're ones where

1263
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,520
it's

1264
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,440
easy to say

1265
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,160
when you can ignore the should

1266
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,319
um do that but also i think you know

1267
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,000
have a chat with the

1268
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,839
ad and be like we've done a bunch of

1269
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,920
them um

1270
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,680
i think it's relatively clear to

1271
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,280
whoever's doing this

1272
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,440
under what conditions they would ignore

1273
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,160
the should so you know are you okay with

1274
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,680
this

1275
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,960
i don't know if that made any sense if i

1276
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,960
just kind of like rambled for a while

1277
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,280
but i mean the easy ones i understand

1278
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,319
i'm fluent in ramble okay great

1279
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,359
excellent

1280
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,040
like i think that the comment was like

1281
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,119
hey you should address these not like

1282
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,800
you have to do each and every one

1283
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,359
exactly according to the following

1284
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,280
following format so yeah we can chat

1285
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,160
with

1286
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,760
chat with them

1287
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,520
and um

1288
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,319
rob go ahead

1289
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,319
yeah i just gotta echo what

1290
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,319
um what warren's saying really so i

1291
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,240
don't think that

1292
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,319
um it's really fair for the ads to go

1293
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,200
beyond what's in rfc 2119 so that

1294
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,880
doesn't say you have to have this extra

1295
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,280
explanation of when it should

1296
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,640
um

1297
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,880
he sort of is not a must and things i

1298
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,559
think it is sort of makes sense though

1299
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,400
in various places to do that

1300
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,119
but yeah completely to one's point i

1301
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,400
think actually chatting with is it

1302
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,640
murray horry the discuss on this i think

1303
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,559
if he's just asking in some places this

1304
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,200
is unclear um if you look through them

1305
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,200
and it looks like that's good and you go

1306
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,640
back to him i would have thought that

1307
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,800
he's not going to be too strict on this

1308
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,880
um there is thought about trying to make

1309
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,319
this stricture in future but i think

1310
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,559
that needs an update to rc2119 but

1311
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,040
that's just my opinion

1312
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,440
yeah i mean looking at the comment like

1313
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,839
rereading it

1314
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:24,000
um you know there i think that some of

1315
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,200
it was

1316
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,160
more many of these uppercase shoulds

1317
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,720
could equally easily have been lowercase

1318
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,000
shoulds

1319
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and maybe those ones you know just

1320
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,680
replace the uppercase ones

1321
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,040
with lowercase ones and problem solved

1322
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,680
okay okay

1323
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,040
yeah that's a that that's a that's an

1324
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,240
excellent point as well

1325
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,200
uh another option to uh to deal with

1326
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,359
these very good

1327
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:57,520
okay uh was that in on the slides

1328
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,760
yeah that's it on the slide so uh path

1329
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,359
forward then um

1330
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,520
get given the feedback

1331
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,440
that we're getting is that we'll do one

1332
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,280
update um

1333
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,839
to the draft covering off everything

1334
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,559
um we'll first order will be to get an

1335
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,520
email out to the various um

1336
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,559
uh area directors for uh to address

1337
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,760
their

1338
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,000
discuss submissions and the comments and

1339
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,119
then

1340
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,400
we'll deal with the shoulds and then

1341
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,880
we'll do one update um

1342
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,440
to the uh to to the draft

1343
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,520
and submit it

1344
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,040
and the reason the main reason for that

1345
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,040
of course is just to you know move

1346
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,640
things forward since we still have the

1347
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,440
rfc editor

1348
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,319
right right and and they you know

1349
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,319
they'll help you with the consistency

1350
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,880
concerns that you had before as well

1351
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,140
um

1352
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,280
[Music]

1353
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,880
yeah it's our first time doing this and

1354
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,119
we were probably

1355
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,640
more

1356
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,240
sort of trying to lean towards being

1357
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,839
polite too much

1358
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,240
and

1359
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,800
one thing that lars asked for was

1360
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,880
more transport area review but since

1361
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,440
we've got one already uh then tommy's on

1362
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,599
the hook for that and uh you know i

1363
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,760
think we can get him to look at this

1364
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,720
uh

1365
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,720
and and respond

1366
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,960
um yeah he seemed to be very interested

1367
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,920
in it

1368
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,559
yeah yeah yeah and and you know what

1369
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,280
basically lars is is uh still reviewing

1370
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,119
from the transport area point of view

1371
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,200
even though he's uh supposed to be

1372
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,800
internet area now or uh general area as

1373
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,920
as chair

1374
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,040
so

1375
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,160
you know you do what you do

1376
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,240
i think warren raise his hand

1377
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,160
yeah go ahead warren

1378
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,079
thank you and yeah waiting and

1379
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,000
submitting a new document with all of

1380
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,880
the changes is definitely an idea

1381
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,280
another thing you might want to consider

1382
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,400
is

1383
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,240
submitting a version if you have one

1384
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,720
easy that has addressed

1385
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,880
the initial set of

1386
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,240
discuss points

1387
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,880
just goes that way those ads can clear

1388
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,720
them and you don't need to sort of wait

1389
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,160
around

1390
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,520
um you know if people have already

1391
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,480
agreed yep this will solve my problem

1392
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,640
submitting a version with that just

1393
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,480
those set of fixes in

1394
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,160
will allow them to clear and then it

1395
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,359
will get them out of their queue and

1396
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,520
they won't be sort of looking at you

1397
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,040
whatever you like it's just us just

1398
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,280
detecting no okay yeah

1399
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,599
that that's definitely reasonable um

1400
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,839
what's the imp what's the impact on the

1401
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,680
process then like if we we do that

1402
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,720
and then

1403
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,920
you know everyone is is is happy at that

1404
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,880
point

1405
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,680
um

1406
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,640
and then

1407
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,880
and then we make the changes with

1408
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,319
respect to the comments and the shoulds

1409
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,839
to the document

1410
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,839
does that reset the clock as far as the

1411
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,160
area director review goes or what

1412
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,558
happens

1413
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:02,559
um

1414
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,559
i may have missed your question or

1415
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,319
misunderstood it but i mean at the

1416
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,760
moment there are four people with

1417
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,960
discusses

1418
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,280
if you submit a version which clears for

1419
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,520
example eric's discusses and he's happy

1420
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,839
with him he will then remove his discuss

1421
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:16,799
point

1422
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:17,920
and

1423
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,680
you know he won't be able to come back

1424
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,160
later and

1425
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,319
reapply it or forget about it or

1426
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:25,359
something

1427
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,760
i'm not sure if i

1428
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,480
answered your question

1429
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,040
it's a it's a it's sort of a one-time

1430
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,400
review thing

1431
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,720
and as long as you don't have uh comment

1432
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,760
creep uh you know which uh some of us

1433
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,760
have seen before

1434
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,520
um then um uh you know but but now all

1435
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,799
the comments are written and they're

1436
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,559
stored in the data tracker and you know

1437
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,400
that's a lot harder to

1438
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,720
for anybody to get away with so um

1439
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,640
you know just consider uh

1440
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,960
updates of the draft that address

1441
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,599
specific comments or discuss blocking

1442
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,559
comments

1443
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,960
and and uh and and we'll knock them down

1444
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,359
as as we can

1445
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,280
i mean another advantage to that is you

1446
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,839
know once you've addressed lars's and

1447
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,760
the other one who's confirmed who the

1448
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,599
other hold up was

1449
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,200
um

1450
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,799
we still need to actually get the people

1451
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,079
whose comments have been addressed and

1452
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,520
are happy to actually click the button

1453
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,880
saying clear

1454
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,720
and you know if they happen to be away

1455
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,799
on vacation that week or whatever they

1456
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,880
might take some time so

1457
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,520
oh yeah i understand yeah yeah

1458
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,880
and it's just whatever

1459
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,559
yeah

1460
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,319
okay yeah thanks for your suggestions

1461
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,119
i believe that yeah i believe that's it

1462
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,400
now

1463
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,000
good

1464
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,720
great thanks

1465
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,879
all right

1466
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,359
so next up we've got a i believe a short

1467
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,520
talk with um that we don't really need

1468
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,960
slides for

1469
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,079
and that's going to be

1470
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,720
the

1471
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,280
the working group adoption review on the

1472
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,680
yang data model for network interconnect

1473
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,079
tester management and and i read out the

1474
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,000
whole title because the title is the

1475
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,799
crux of the uh

1476
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,160
objection

1477
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,359
and um i saw this morning that uh

1478
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,559
vladimir has uh made a uh

1479
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:33,040
uh

1480
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,240
uh made made a proposal uh of uh any

1481
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,119
titles uh he's glad to accept any of the

1482
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,720
four about four or five titles that will

1483
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,200
work for him uh and that's when i had to

1484
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,440
turn my email off to do this

1485
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,480
so actually the vpn more more

1486
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,760
accurately

1487
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,400
so um

1488
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,119
vlad has uh uh and i see you're in the

1489
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,599
room feel free to turn your mic on there

1490
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,640
um you know remotely um

1491
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,079
hi

1492
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,839
hi good thanks for joining us

1493
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:12,079
um have you seen any response to the um

1494
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,480
seen any response to uh your proposal

1495
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,200
from this morning

1496
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,319
not yet

1497
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:21,440
but uh i think the the discussion is now

1498
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,920
focusing on pretty

1499
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,520
pretty clear like points and

1500
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,119
i i think that the argument that reusing

1501
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,640
network interconnect device as a term

1502
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,440
although it appears a long sequence of

1503
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,480
nouns

1504
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,920
it is still

1505
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,920
a noun that describes something that is

1506
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,359
known in the work group so it should be

1507
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:48,319
considered as an option even if

1508
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:52,319
tom thinks it's uh long and uh

1509
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,680
complicates the sentence somehow

1510
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,400
so i'm i'm not sure the the title should

1511
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,000
be changed but

1512
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,799
i don't mind if it is changed if it is

1513
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,119
made shorter it kind of broadens the

1514
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,880
scope which is uh not

1515
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,240
um like corresponding to what the actual

1516
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,240
contents of the draft is like if you say

1517
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,880
a network tester

1518
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,119
and then you include probably also the

1519
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,000
the stateful protocols and other things

1520
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,079
that go outside of the scope of testing

1521
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,559
and network interconnect

1522
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,359
either it's a device or a more complex

1523
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,160
system which

1524
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,760
is what the draft actually focuses on so

1525
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,000
i think we can make the title shorter

1526
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
but this will actually increase the

1527
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,640
scope to something that is not inside

1528
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,880
the contents of the draft

1529
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,520
so it's up to the the i guess the work

1530
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,040
group to agree on something

1531
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,599
right right and also the um

1532
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,280
i mean you can you can

1533
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,200
you can aid the title by um

1534
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,200
putting more scope in the abstract at

1535
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,040
least it's it's fairly close by

1536
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,799
yes

1537
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,359
i i agree i mean

1538
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,240
there are a lot of drafts that have

1539
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,599
title that

1540
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,839
implies a broader scope that's the

1541
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,160
contents of the drug actually has

1542
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,720
and this has worked so far so it's

1543
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,759
not a problem for me

1544
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,040
great

1545
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,640
so let's uh let's try to get some

1546
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,240
agreement on this fairly quickly and

1547
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,559
then i think we've uh

1548
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,520
we've got uh potential adoption here the

1549
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,759
um

1550
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,000
uh it's it's pretty unusual for us to

1551
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,839
get a you know an objection about um

1552
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,640
anything specific and and then the title

1553
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,480
uh ended up being the main sticking

1554
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,960
point here so let's uh let's try to try

1555
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,119
to get bass that in a good way

1556
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,520
and uh keep going so thanks for your uh

1557
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,960
thanks for your work on that flat

1558
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,680
okay thank you

1559
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,000
all right

1560
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,760
uh rob

1561
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,520
you're in the queue

1562
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,440
yes uh robertson cisco just to make a

1563
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,440
quick comment um i didn't comment on the

1564
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,200
adoption poll but actually i think this

1565
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,559
is a good piece of work i think it's a

1566
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,040
good thing to be doing i think that

1567
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,799
finding a sort of formal data model for

1568
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,160
programming these things will make it

1569
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,040
easier to write automated tests um and

1570
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,799
then have those into operate with

1571
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,880
different implementations so so i'm very

1572
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,760
supportive of this work

1573
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,200
and thank you hopefully the title

1574
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,520
shouldn't stop this option

1575
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,040
that's obvious

1576
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,319
right right i think we all we we all we

1577
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:42,920
all agree it we all agree on that

1578
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,839
okay

1579
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,799
all right so when uh

1580
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,559
now we're making good progress again so

1581
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,319
up next we've got the

1582
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:02,880
uh benchmarking methodology for stateful

1583
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,440
nat xy gateways using rfc 4814

1584
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,680
pseudorandom port numbers

1585
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,039
um

1586
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,559
that's a good long title too

1587
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,880
but uh

1588
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,640
keith i think you're going to do the

1589
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,839
presentation today right

1590
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,359
i see you've got your mic turned on uh

1591
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:35,839
keiichi but i but i i can't hear you

1592
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,839
can anybody else hear keiichi

1593
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,078
nope

1594
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,400
okay if you're on a mac and you're

1595
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,160
really frustrated that your browser

1596
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,839
won't let your microphone work i

1597
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,720
completely understand the struggle

1598
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,880
take your time

1599
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,559
hello

1600
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,240
yes there you are okay okay okay so my

1601
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,480
my headset didn't work

1602
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,839
correctly so i'm now using my

1603
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,119
uh

1604
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,760
notebook microphone so the sound might

1605
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,559
be

1606
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,839
a bit

1607
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:32,720
uh that's fine not very good but anyway

1608
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,480
no it sounds good

1609
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,240
okay

1610
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,960
so okay so hello my name is keith shima

1611
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,640
from iij

1612
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,799
and in this thought i will talk about

1613
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,440
the latest updates about draft

1614
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,599
which title is this benchmarking

1615
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,680
methodology for states for not xy

1616
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,039
gateways

1617
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,520
using the pseudorandom port numbers

1618
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,680
okay next slide please

1619
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,000
yeah very good and and caichi i'm going

1620
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,920
to give you um i'm going to give you

1621
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,039
like a 14 minute uh time clock here the

1622
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,319
the minute i

1623
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,400
uh i figure out how to do that here we

1624
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,280
go

1625
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,200
uh

1626
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,160
and

1627
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,240
just to just to try to divide the time

1628
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,599
among the drafts that we've got

1629
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,280
remaining okay

1630
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,559
okay

1631
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,079
that's right okay and this draft is a

1632
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,200
guideline to provide a lot usable and

1633
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,920
meaningful measurement procedure using

1634
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,839
existing benchmarking method for not xy

1635
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,799
and gateways since these data flow boxes

1636
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:33,920
has to

1637
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,920
manage the connection tracking table

1638
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,440
entries so we need some special cares so

1639
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,240
this draft focus on the three parts the

1640
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,839
first one is a

1641
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,760
connection establishment performance

1642
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,599
measurement the second one is a

1643
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,839
connection teardown performance

1644
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,359
measurement which is a new in this

1645
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,720
latest draft

1646
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,200
and the third one is a

1647
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,280
kind of operation guideline when using

1648
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,160
pseudorandom port numbers when sending

1649
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,960
a measurement packets so this is a

1650
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,280
the point three points of this draft

1651
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,000
okay next please

1652
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,359
okay uh this is at

1653
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:16,319
the brief history of the the drugs i i

1654
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,559
think i don't need to explain this

1655
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,920
so we have submitted the third draft

1656
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,400
this time which include the connection

1657
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,520
tear down

1658
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,119
performance measurement part

1659
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,000
and we have added some

1660
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
preliminary test results in the draft

1661
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,039
too

1662
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,799
okay next slide please

1663
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,160
okay

1664
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,480
so this chart shows the overview of the

1665
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,240
the test bit configuration so uh

1666
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,720
i also don't think we need to explain

1667
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,680
in detail in this figure by the way so

1668
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,319
there's some tester and the duty

1669
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,640
and the testosterone some measurement

1670
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,480
packets on one interface and receive the

1671
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,039
packet on the other interface and we

1672
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,520
when we do the bi-directional testing we

1673
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,799
do the similar thing using the different

1674
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,760
interfaces the point is that the dut is

1675
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,200
a stateful

1676
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,960
box so the dut has to manage a

1677
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,839
connection tracking table in it and we

1678
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,599
don't know we can

1679
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,760
we don't have any control

1680
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,839
uh on the connection tracking cable from

1681
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,400
tester but we have to

1682
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,200
synchronize we have to be have the same

1683
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,280
state table in the testosterone because

1684
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,960
we need to

1685
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,079
uh

1686
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,760
do some kind of a

1687
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,960
testing

1688
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,400
using the

1689
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,520
opposite direction so this is the point

1690
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,640
we want to discuss in this draft

1691
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,000
okay next slide please

1692
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,440
and to achieve

1693
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,400
the reproducible measurement we ensure

1694
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,599
these two

1695
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:02,559
things

1696
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:03,440
the

1697
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,400
we split the test phase into two phases

1698
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,200
the one is applying preliminary test

1699
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,160
phase which is focusing on the

1700
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,839
filling out the connection tracking

1701
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:15,920
table of the duty

1702
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,640
and make a synchronized state table in

1703
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,240
the tester

1704
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,720
and the second phase is uh the real test

1705
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,880
phase this is

1706
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,799
almost the same as the other

1707
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,880
benchmarking methodology

1708
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,400
method like rfc 2544

1709
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,880
so the point is we have to these two

1710
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,200
phases when we do

1711
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,200
the measurement for state for not x y

1712
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,559
gateways

1713
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,839
okay next please

1714
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,359
okay

1715
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,480
this is a page six

1716
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,880
uh

1717
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,480
oh excellent can you go back to the

1718
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,359
previous slide

1719
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,198
okay

1720
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:22,880
it's okay so please

1721
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,319
move forward the next slide

1722
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,679
okay and this slide explains the new

1723
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,158
items in this draft in the states from

1724
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,479
nat xi gateway it is important to

1725
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,719
measure the performance of the teardown

1726
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,719
operation

1727
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,040
of the connection tracking entries to do

1728
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,839
that we added a procedure

1729
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:46,479
uh to measure the performance

1730
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,120
in the latest draft the basic idea is to

1731
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,839
delete the entire connection tracking

1732
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,600
table entries

1733
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,920
during the measurement process and

1734
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,960
measure

1735
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,640
the time spent for the deletion

1736
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,880
operation

1737
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,679
okay

1738
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,399
next slide please

1739
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,279
okay this is what we have done in this

1740
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,880
draft

1741
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,560
so we

1742
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,920
create

1743
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,080
a connection tracking tables in the

1744
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,839
preliminary phase which

1745
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:22,799
is uh we create and the number end of

1746
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,319
the connection

1747
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,040
tracking table entries in the duty

1748
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,799
and other

1749
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,880
when we measure the connection teardown

1750
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,040
performance we remove

1751
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,600
the entire connection tracking table by

1752
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,719
using

1753
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,719
some kind of out of band

1754
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,120
methodology like a

1755
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,920
command line operation remotely manage

1756
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,120
the command line operation on the duty

1757
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,600
so by measuring the time

1758
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,960
and the split

1759
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,158
divide

1760
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,360
the the total time to delete the entire

1761
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,239
connection tracking table so we can get

1762
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,120
the ratio the connection tracking table

1763
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,000
entry deletion late

1764
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,840
by doing this procedure

1765
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,520
okay next please

1766
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,480
and uh

1767
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,760
since this part is a new in this draft

1768
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,320
we probably have still some

1769
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,080
debatable points

1770
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,920
uh in this connection kia down

1771
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,840
measurement procedure

1772
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,880
uh we want to continue the discussion in

1773
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,520
the bmw list

1774
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,640
to enhance the quality

1775
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,600
of this draft

1776
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,600
just for your information we have

1777
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,320
measured the tran performance using

1778
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,800
linux ip tables function

1779
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,600
and

1780
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,960
u not 6 4 counter modules using our

1781
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,960
technique so we are going to show

1782
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,000
some results in the following slides

1783
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,840
please go to the next slide

1784
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,760
okay this is

1785
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,960
uh some

1786
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,600
detailed configuration explanation of

1787
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,719
the

1788
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,159
ip tables experiments we have done

1789
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,640
and the detailed result is also written

1790
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,360
in the draft so if you

1791
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,199
want the more

1792
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:26,719
data information probably you can check

1793
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,679
the draft contents so in this case we

1794
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,560
use ip tables functions

1795
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,800
and we do the not 4 4

1796
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,280
address

1797
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,560
uh

1798
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,440
translation mechanism and we have

1799
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,520
measured especially for the connection

1800
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,719
theodom performance in this case by

1801
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,000
changing

1802
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,280
uh several parameters of the nut 4-4 box

1803
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,679
and the result is in the next slide

1804
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:03,679
can you move to the next slide

1805
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,880
yep

1806
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,199
sorry for the delay i was trying to

1807
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,440
trying to grab a few notes there

1808
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,520
okay

1809
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,040
so

1810
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,880
this is a bit complicated table but the

1811
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,520
actual barriers are

1812
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,679
is not very important so the point is

1813
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,600
that each column

1814
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,719
is

1815
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,080
uh

1816
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,920
each different

1817
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,040
tests using the different parameters

1818
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,400
the top law is the number of connections

1819
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,520
the minimum one on the left side one is

1820
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,760
a 1.5

1821
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,520
million connections

1822
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,600
and in the largest case in the right

1823
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,840
heights right hand side

1824
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,840
we created 800 million

1825
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,320
connections on the nat four four box

1826
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,520
using our testing procedure

1827
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,760
and

1828
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,440
and finally we in this case we are

1829
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,360
focusing on the connection teardown

1830
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,640
performance measurement so we remove the

1831
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,960
entire connection tracking table

1832
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,679
after we have created

1833
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,679
that much of the connection tracking

1834
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:14,960
entries

1835
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,040
and

1836
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,400
the lowest

1837
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,560
law shows

1838
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,679
the rate

1839
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:24,239
of the connection tracking table

1840
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,560
deletion

1841
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,600
count per second so in this case we can

1842
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,960
see that

1843
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,159
almost 4

1844
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,920
350 to 400

1845
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,360
entries can be removed per second

1846
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,960
when we use ip tables

1847
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,920
of the

1848
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,560
other target duty node

1849
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,520
uh and again so the actual value is not

1850
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,679
very important here the important point

1851
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,320
is that we are providing some procedure

1852
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,120
to measure the connection theorem method

1853
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,239
for the duty and we could get

1854
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,960
this kind of a stable

1855
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,920
measurement result with our methodology

1856
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,480
okay next slide please

1857
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,879
very good

1858
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,600
and this is another experiment which is

1859
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,800
also written in the draft too in detail

1860
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,520
so in this case we use the dual

1861
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,000
color module linux kernel module which

1862
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,960
is

1863
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,719
um used

1864
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,480
as the not force not six for gateways

1865
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,040
and next please

1866
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,519
okay

1867
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,440
and the same as the ip tables case we

1868
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,760
have tested several different parameters

1869
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,920
and that the parameters are almost the

1870
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,360
same but

1871
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,800
there is a little

1872
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,199
uh difference in the right hand side so

1873
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:52,719
this is because

1874
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:54,320
of the some

1875
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,320
resource limitation of our test bet

1876
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,480
environment so

1877
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,719
we are sorry it is not very consistent

1878
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,000
but anyway the actual absolute value is

1879
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,760
not very important we could the

1880
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,360
important thing is

1881
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,239
we could provide some testing procedure

1882
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,400
for connection tied on

1883
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,400
performance measurement using this

1884
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,760
methodology

1885
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,960
and

1886
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,960
just for your information the connection

1887
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,480
teardown

1888
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,360
late

1889
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,560
in june counter module is much faster

1890
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,480
than the ip cables case

1891
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,000
uh we didn't get into detail why this is

1892
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,040
much faster than ib cables but the point

1893
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,960
is again

1894
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,080
the methodology provides some

1895
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,440
stateful and repeat as a stable

1896
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,520
and reproducible

1897
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,600
procedure for the connection theater

1898
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,280
methodology

1899
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,239
okay

1900
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,559
next

1901
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:54,000
please and okay and this is the final

1902
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,800
slide of my presentation

1903
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,840
and in this draft we have added

1904
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,520
the connection theater measurement

1905
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,640
method

1906
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,960
uh in the latest draft so we have

1907
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,360
already provided connection

1908
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,360
establishment performance measurement

1909
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,080
methodology in the past draft and we

1910
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,920
have also mentioned

1911
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,880
uh some kind of operation guideline

1912
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,560
when performing

1913
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,040
the packet folding benchmark testing for

1914
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,960
stateful gateways stateful not gateways

1915
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,120
when using with a suit random port

1916
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,320
numbers

1917
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,320
so this is a very important point

1918
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,400
because we when we use

1919
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,080
soda random port numbers when testing

1920
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,159
the connection table tracking entries

1921
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,719
are getting larger and larger

1922
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,320
so we have to

1923
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,600
manage

1924
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,520
to control the size of the connection

1925
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,600
tracking table entries

1926
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,719
and at the same time we have to

1927
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,440
provide some reproducible testing

1928
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,480
methodology for that type of a stateful

1929
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,480
testing so we have

1930
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,760
mentioned

1931
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,120
the three points as we i have explained

1932
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,640
in the beginning

1933
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,320
and this is the latest draft

1934
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,520
and uh

1935
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,320
so this draft is focusing on the

1936
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,880
stateful not xy gateway

1937
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,800
performance measurement so if you have

1938
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,520
any other idea

1939
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,800
should be added to this draft to make

1940
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,440
more reasonable measurement methodology

1941
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,080
for status stateful not gateways then we

1942
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,920
let us know

1943
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,560
on this room or on the mailing list

1944
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,480
okay and we think this can be a

1945
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,480
potential working group draft

1946
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,400
thank you very much

1947
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,440
thank you

1948
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,800
kkg and

1949
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,360
nice job keeping it within time uh

1950
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,880
quickly let me ask if there's any

1951
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,880
questions and um

1952
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,040
if anyone's read the draft recently to

1953
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,239
uh

1954
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,719
you know sort of go to the mic and and

1955
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:57,719
comment

1956
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,239
and we've had um we've had pretty good

1957
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,280
commentary on this uh last year in

1958
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,480
particular

1959
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,480
um

1960
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,719
uh through the may july time frame i

1961
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:15,679
believe

1962
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,679
and um

1963
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,920
uh so it's just you know it's it's it's

1964
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,239
really just a matter of uh you know you

1965
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,640
guys feeling comfortable and and

1966
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,000
we'll try to start a working group

1967
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,199
adoption after we get the yang model uh

1968
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:33,520
uh sorted out i think uh so um

1969
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,120
any thoughts on that from the working

1970
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,120
group

1971
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,280
okay

1972
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,560
well

1973
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,400
kind of a quiet crowd here today but

1974
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,080
that's all right

1975
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,520
all right so um so we'll we'll uh

1976
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,000
we'll proceed uh with a with an adoption

1977
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,320
call and see how that goes and and

1978
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,760
hopefully some of the folks who

1979
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,320
commented on the list will uh we'll

1980
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,679
react to that and and then we'll have uh

1981
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,000
another uh another draft to work on here

1982
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,400
in the in the group but um you know you

1983
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,120
you

1984
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,000
kg you and gabor have kept up very well

1985
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,920
with your experiments and and that's

1986
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,719
great stuff so

1987
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,320
thanks for sharing the results again

1988
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,760
today

1989
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,960
okay all right thank you very much

1990
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,920
all right so next up we have the um

1991
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,080
uh considerations for benchmarking

1992
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,920
network performance and containerized

1993
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,000
infrastructures

1994
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,360
and

1995
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,960
i'm going to bring that slide up

1996
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,800
all right

1997
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,520
and um

1998
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,679
minute

1999
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:04,560
tran

2000
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,199
are you uh are you with us there tran

2001
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,839
yes um

2002
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,239
yes yes i can hear you just fine welcome

2003
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,760
to the group i think this is your first

2004
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:18,360
time presenting as well right

2005
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,199
yes yes go right ahead

2006
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:28,080
so hello everyone so this is my first

2007
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,800
time was running an itf

2008
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,639
presentation so

2009
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,560
for this time i want to

2010
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,480
give a presentation about the update of

2011
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,960
our draft the consideration for being

2012
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,639
matching level performance in

2013
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,880
containerized infrastructure

2014
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,440
just like this

2015
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,520
so first a brief uh overview and about

2016
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,000
our drafts of wrap is there to

2017
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,679
distinguish the band matching of

2018
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,360
containerized infrastructures from

2019
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,679
previous membership methodology for

2020
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:02,480
vm based engp infrastructures so

2021
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,120
actually there are two kinds of things

2022
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,960
that we want to investigate inside our

2023
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,440
draft the first is a different network

2024
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,840
models that support packet acceleration

2025
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,840
technologies based on the district and

2026
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,520
the second thing is

2027
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,600
different department configurations that

2028
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,520
can make an impact on the container

2029
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,159
network they are the restock isolation

2030
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,880
new batch or services journey

2031
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,880
necessary

2032
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,159
so

2033
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:33,920
uh our latest presentation as itf even

2034
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:34,800
is

2035
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,000
if i'm not

2036
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
wrong is itf 106. so let's supplement

2037
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,639
our drop in version three and

2038
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,960
from from that time till now see we have

2039
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,320
multiples in it so this i give a summary

2040
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,320
of the update that we have made to our

2041
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,760
draft so the first thing is the old

2042
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,320
section 3.1 that is a comparison with

2043
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,840
the vmware infrastructures and the

2044
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,000
section 4 that is a bandwagon scenario

2045
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,760
for the coding right infrastructure we

2046
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,960
have move on

2047
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,920
and group it into the new section 3 that

2048
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,040
is contacted by infrastructure overview

2049
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,199
then we move the

2050
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:17,120
subsection 3.2 and we move it to the new

2051
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,040
system four in nine booking model

2052
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,600
equivalent infrastructure so inside this

2053
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,239
section we classify the networking

2054
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,120
models based on the district location

2055
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,000
and

2056
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
the third update is

2057
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,639
we make the session three by three in

2058
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:33,920
version three that is resolved

2059
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,560
consideration to the new system five and

2060
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,040
we rename it the performance impact to

2061
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:39,920
show

2062
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,159
different kind of uh resort

2063
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:44,320
configuration or deployment

2064
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,320
configuration that can make an impact on

2065
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,199
the

2066
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,760
performance of the container network and

2067
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,880
finally we add a new openness sections

2068
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,120
also our blemish link experience to

2069
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,360
multiple hackathon that we have

2070
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,040
participated so far

2071
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,840
let's try this

2072
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,440
so this is the detail of the update so

2073
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,120
the first update is the new section

2074
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,960
three the container infrastructure

2075
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,520
overview so the first thing inside this

2076
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,679
section is a comparison with the vmware

2077
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,800
infrastructure which is o 3.1 then we

2078
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,760
classify different categories dependent

2079
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,360
methods so

2080
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,600
in the figure here you can see there are

2081
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,639
four

2082
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:28,560
different categories different methods

2083
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,920
that is

2084
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,840
cvna on metal or this vnf on the port on

2085
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,120
the bare metal

2086
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,239
cnn on vm and the partner vm and based

2087
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:40,880
on that classification we

2088
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,880
make up four banner screen scenarios for

2089
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,280
the cortical infrastructures that is the

2090
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,440
old section four in the drive version

2091
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,760
three so we

2092
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,080
read again and we

2093
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,480
reverend all the session into the new

2094
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,639
one here so to make our draft become

2095
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,239
more confident

2096
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:00,800
for this season number three

2097
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,600
let's slide please

2098
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,440
so the update is the second update is a

2099
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,800
networking model in category

2100
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,440
infrastructure so the previous one is a

2101
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,920
container networking classification

2102
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,560
so in our pivot graphs just

2103
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,880
include three kind of model the kernel

2104
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,440
space user space srov

2105
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,400
and

2106
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,480
to this draft we have update two new

2107
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,719
categories that is the ebpf

2108
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,320
acceleration model

2109
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,639
with notable use in psyllium and calico

2110
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:34,000
cli parking and the model combination

2111
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,480
and this one is normally used in service

2112
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,880
function training case where users may

2113
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,040
be sweeping you for eastwood traffic and

2114
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,960
sr will be for

2115
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,600
not such traffic

2116
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,440
this side please

2117
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,440
okay well i think you've got a question

2118
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,440
there bill did you want to want to ask a

2119
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,760
question on this uh on this particular

2120
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,360
slide yeah specifically on the

2121
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,400
combination uh model um did you consider

2122
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,040
using beats directly between the two

2123
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,120
containers for east-west traffic

2124
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:09,040
and eliminating the v-switch altogether

2125
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,480
um you repeat the question i'm not here

2126
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,920
clearly yes

2127
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,480
uh let me try speaking more clearly

2128
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,960
in the model combination on the lower

2129
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,760
right

2130
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,760
uh picture

2131
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,840
did you consider using a v pair between

2132
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,719
the two top boxes directly

2133
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:33,360
for east-west traffic as opposed to

2134
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:37,199
going through the v-switch yes we use

2135
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:38,719
the vid pair for

2136
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,760
the user's way this week

2137
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,120
yes i

2138
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,280
imagine you could eliminate the v-switch

2139
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,880
altogether and perhaps get better

2140
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,639
performance by connecting the top two

2141
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:51,920
boxes with a v directly between them

2142
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,840
rather than going through the v-switch

2143
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,320
[Music]

2144
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,679
so you mean we use a

2145
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,920
the srov for the eastward traffic as

2146
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,480
well right

2147
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,400
uh

2148
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,639
i'll send an email to you

2149
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,960
i'll do it thank you yeah

2150
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,600
it it in the in the physical world it

2151
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,840
would be like uh connecting a crossover

2152
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,320
cable between the two ethernet ports

2153
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:24,159
instead of going back to the v-switch

2154
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,639
okay

2155
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,719
so the third update is the performance

2156
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:40,960
impact so in the old section 3.3 uh we

2157
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,800
consider the hilpet new magnet cpu

2158
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,719
acceleration and

2159
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:46,320
in this track we're adding two new

2160
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,080
impact the first one is service function

2161
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,040
training

2162
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:49,760
and

2163
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,320
because we see that in every environment

2164
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,159
physical network part it can be

2165
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:56,960
connected to multiple vna rather than a

2166
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,199
single vietnam and

2167
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,320
we

2168
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:04,480
consider two aspects in the 700 chaining

2169
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,719
scenarios that is a number of bnf inside

2170
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,280
chains and different networks technology

2171
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,199
that can be used to provide the network

2172
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,040
service between the vmware

2173
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:13,760
and

2174
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,120
the second impact is internet networking

2175
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,880
so i was

2176
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,679
observed in the new ltsr documents there

2177
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:23,679
are different internal networking

2178
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,040
technologies

2179
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,840
and it may impact it may can make an

2180
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,920
impact on the control level performance

2181
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,560
so you tend to employ this baseline bgp

2182
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,960
only to underlay so

2183
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,800
we actually want to do additional

2184
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,199
consideration because we haven't uh

2185
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,199
make a test on it yet and we plan to do

2186
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,320
it in our neck idea hackathon

2187
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,679
next slide please

2188
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,040
and uh uh tran we got about uh

2189
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,199
a little less than seven minutes left so

2190
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:54,080
uh

2191
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,480
cover things uh cover the most important

2192
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,000
things in the most amount of detail

2193
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,480
please thank you yes

2194
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,040
so the arduino 4 is a update session you

2195
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,719
include other package results

2196
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,639
inside this

2197
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:11,639
okay

2198
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,600
so this is the uh

2199
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,080
summer of our update from the reddit

2200
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,719
hackathon so we make uh

2201
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,560
the marking on the swift and chaining

2202
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,040
scenario where we measure throughput

2203
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,159
when using srp comparing the bbp and we

2204
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:30,800
consider two scenarios that the service

2205
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,400
chain is single node and silicon in

2206
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,120
matinos we also bear match the impact of

2207
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,199
the number of vmf by increasing the

2208
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:40,960
number of ports inside from 2 to 46

2209
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,679
next slightly

2210
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,400
so this is our test bed so we you will

2211
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,159
choose worker notes and

2212
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,400
the backlight is used for the single

2213
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,000
note carry and red light u for the

2214
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,760
multi-mode case

2215
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,480
let's look at this

2216
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:04,159
so this is a resolve obtained from the

2217
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,639
high quality one on three so

2218
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,320
the first is a comparison between the

2219
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,120
sro vip and only bpp

2220
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,040
we can see that the srlv performs

2221
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,199
significantly better than the rig is

2222
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,120
shown on the grey column

2223
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,280
and the impact of the number of dna

2224
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,159
inside chain is so in the increasing

2225
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,560
number of the port from 2 to 46 and we

2226
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,840
also that

2227
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,159
is only video to put in a small package

2228
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:32,159
size 64 128 for lack of package size

2229
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:35,280
from 256 it does not make any kind of

2230
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,480
impact

2231
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,839
let's try this

2232
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,960
so this slide saw the multi-node

2233
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,600
scenario result so

2234
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,920
we observed that to put in the material

2235
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,480
scenario in slightly smaller than the

2236
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,800
single node with smaller packet size

2237
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,199
less than 512

2238
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,199
due to the equine the increasing number

2239
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:59,040
of ports and

2240
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,440
for the like a bracket side from like a

2241
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,840
zone 1000 there will be no

2242
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,560
significant impact on the triple

2243
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,280
let's say this

2244
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,239
so this is the next step of

2245
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:16,400
our draft so first we

2246
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,239
will try to keep updated driveway on the

2247
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:20,639
latest technologies and

2248
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,960
in the high carton we

2249
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,120
we test internal networking technique

2250
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,679
that we add on on the drive we also want

2251
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:30,880
to test the evp accession model

2252
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:34,960
with and without nsc uploading and

2253
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,440
we use the result to prove our personal

2254
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,840
features

2255
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,719
this is my last time my presentation

2256
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:46,960
very good

2257
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,199
okay thanks very much grant

2258
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,520
um any any questions

2259
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,360
um

2260
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,440
i know you went through the the test

2261
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,600
conditions fairly quickly there

2262
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,960
and um

2263
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,960
uh it's good to see the directions that

2264
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,880
you're going and that you're you're

2265
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,040
basically following uh

2266
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,360
following all the draft uh scenarios

2267
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:10,000
with uh tests that you've conducted uh

2268
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
in the open where people can look over

2269
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,040
your shoulder that's great any any uh

2270
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,159
any comments on the on the draft

2271
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:20,638
so far

2272
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,800
all right well uh bill's gonna uh get in

2273
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,320
touch with you by email about the uh the

2274
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,400
ethernet uh fairing

2275
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,600
uh option

2276
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,480
and uh that might be a way to uh improve

2277
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,239
performance as well by avoiding the

2278
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:40,400
v-switch or the fee

2279
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,239
so i think that's that's something else

2280
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:45,559
you could try

2281
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,520
and um i mean one thing we usually ask

2282
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:54,239
is how many people have read the draft

2283
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:56,080
if you've um

2284
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,800
if you've read the draft and and um sort

2285
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,560
of want to support this work

2286
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,719
uh just sort of uh

2287
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:04,560
raise your hand and get in the cube for

2288
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,320
a moment and we'll uh

2289
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,920
we'll be able to see that you're uh

2290
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:12,320
you're you're actively doing that oh

2291
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:17,120
okay good fratco's ready thank you vreco

2292
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,520
yeah this is um this is pretty close to

2293
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,520
the uh to the work that you guys have

2294
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,520
been doing in fdio for a long time so uh

2295
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,360
i would think that this would be a good

2296
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,159
uh good place for a cross pollination of

2297
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,600
your experiences

2298
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,280
so thanks for uh thanks for that

2299
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,599
okay

2300
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:50,159
well um

2301
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:51,840
if there isn't anything else i think

2302
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,800
we'll

2303
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,280
we'll move on with uh one last thanks to

2304
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,080
you tron for uh for presenting today

2305
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,320
good job

2306
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,199
all right

2307
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,199
all right giuseppe

2308
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,360
i'm gonna bring your uh first deck of

2309
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,840
slides to the

2310
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,159
uh hello can you hear me

2311
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,239
yes yeah i can hear you very well

2312
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:27,679
okay good

2313
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:29,679
uh welcome to the

2314
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:30,719
uh

2315
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:32,639
benchmarking uh

2316
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,159
working group here

2317
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:37,679
uh and i i i know you well from ippm

2318
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,199
work but uh

2319
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:42,080
uh this this crowd may not uh

2320
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,520
may not have that crossover so uh

2321
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,800
uh welcome

2322
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,960
and uh welcome to anyone in your author

2323
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,679
team that's uh that's present as well

2324
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,320
so um

2325
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,199
it looks like we can go with 14 minutes

2326
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,600
again so that's what we're gonna do and

2327
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,000
uh go right ahead whenever you're ready

2328
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,639
okay yeah this is a new work about

2329
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,800
benchmarking methodology for mpls

2330
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,320
segment routing this is uh already zero

2331
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,040
one version since we

2332
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,360
got some input from

2333
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,760
luis from telefonica and we included

2334
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:21,679
those swim as qualcomm so next light

2335
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:24,000
okay

2336
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:26,719
yeah just the ground and the motivation

2337
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:28,000
for this work

2338
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,840
uh there is an rfc

2339
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,600
5695 that described the methodology for

2340
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,840
benchmarking mpls forwarding device

2341
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:41,199
while segment routing that defined in

2342
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:44,400
rfc 8402

2343
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,280
is applied to mpls data plane

2344
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,239
and

2345
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:51,199
we found interesting to understand how

2346
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:52,719
to benchmark

2347
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:55,760
uh dsr mpls behavior

2348
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,400
and we didn't find a standard method

2349
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,080
defined to compare and contrast the

2350
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,639
the fundamental sr and pls for wording

2351
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,639
capabilities

2352
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,920
so in this this new draft aims to

2353
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,040
complement rfc

2354
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:16,960
5695 by defining methodology for srm tls

2355
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,280
and of course it it builds up on rfc

2356
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,119
2544

2357
01:35:22,119 --> 01:35:27,600
5695 and the base s segment routing fc

2358
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,239
next slide

2359
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,199
yeah just a recap about the sr mpls

2360
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:36,960
operation so

2361
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,440
segment routing is applied to mpls

2362
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,080
architecture with just a minimum change

2363
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,320
to forwarding plane

2364
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,400
uh in particular this a segment is

2365
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,199
encoded as an npls label and an sr

2366
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,920
policy is instantiated as a stack of

2367
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,600
labels

2368
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,159
so there are three fundamental

2369
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,880
operations for sr mpls

2370
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,920
that is push next and continue

2371
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,560
operations so push consists of the

2372
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,199
insect of the insertion of a segment at

2373
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:09,440
the top of the segment list

2374
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,840
next consists of the inspection of the

2375
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,280
next segment

2376
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,239
and the active segment is completed then

2377
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:17,840
the next segment

2378
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,040
is active

2379
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,920
and continue happens when the the active

2380
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,320
segment is not completed so it remains

2381
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,239
active

2382
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:28,959
next slide

2383
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,199
yeah

2384
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:36,639
now we can see what we

2385
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:38,960
this draft can

2386
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,400
keep

2387
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:43,560
similar or equal to rfc

2388
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,159
5695 in particular

2389
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,480
the device under test is connected to

2390
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:53,400
test port and test tool according to rfc

2391
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:56,880
2544 so not big change from this point

2392
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,560
of view

2393
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,280
also the recommended topology for sr

2394
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,159
mpls forwarding benchmarking can be the

2395
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:09,679
same as mpls so as described in rfc 5695

2396
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:11,920
for bot single part and multi-portion

2397
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,080
areas

2398
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,639
and also the frame characteristics can

2399
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:19,520
be basically the same we can see some

2400
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:22,080
changes in the next slide but

2401
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,760
the frame characteristics can be the

2402
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,880
same so next

2403
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:29,760
yeah

2404
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,159
in this draft we want to summarize

2405
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:34,560
just the initial proposal changed from

2406
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,719
lfc

2407
01:37:35,719 --> 01:37:38,800
5695 so first of all we need to

2408
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,920
recommend

2409
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,880
that the device under test support

2410
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:46,480
uh an sr extension for dynamic igp such

2411
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:51,119
as isis spf or bgp

2412
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:54,400
in addition there is a big limitation in

2413
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:58,960
rfc 5695 because it requires exactly a

2414
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,560
single entry in the mpls label stack but

2415
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:05,600
with srmpls the number of entries in the

2416
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,000
label stack should be generalized in

2417
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,520
order to to benchmark an sr policy

2418
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,119
so this can be

2419
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:16,320
one change that we need to do

2420
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,880
because the number of labels must be

2421
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,600
chosen also taking into account the the

2422
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,320
maximum frame payload size

2423
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,320
that is also

2424
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,600
given by

2425
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,719
the rfc 5695

2426
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,199
and in addition there are new parameters

2427
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:35,840
that need to be specified and also need

2428
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,320
to be reported

2429
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,440
which forwarding operation so push next

2430
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,119
or continue

2431
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:45,600
uh the number of segments that are

2432
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,239
considered so because this may affect

2433
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:52,080
the the benchmark performance

2434
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,760
also whether global seed or local seed

2435
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,320
are used so the forward which forwarding

2436
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,320
behavior is you

2437
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:03,760
and also whether we are talking about we

2438
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,440
are let's say

2439
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,719
benchmarking an sr policy head and or

2440
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:12,800
endpoint behavior

2441
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:15,119
next

2442
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:22,000
yeah in comparison with the

2443
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,960
benchmarking tests that are defined in

2444
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,920
the rfc 5695

2445
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,159
there are a lot of similarity of course

2446
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:32,719
because the push operation

2447
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,960
that i have described correspond to the

2448
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,199
label push function

2449
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:40,800
in rfc 5695

2450
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,800
and the same map ends for the next

2451
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,119
operations that correspond to the label

2452
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:47,360
pop function and the continued ratio

2453
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,760
that corresponds to the labels web drop

2454
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,280
function

2455
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,239
so

2456
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:54,639
the only change is related to the member

2457
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:58,639
level to the number of labels and to the

2458
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:01,360
to the structure of the

2459
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:04,080
yes of course

2460
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,159
uh and also the reporting format is

2461
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:07,760
going to change

2462
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,719
so next life

2463
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:13,360
yeah what are the next steps so

2464
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,239
we

2465
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:16,800
welcome feedback from the community

2466
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,800
because there are some some pending

2467
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,440
points that also were raised during the

2468
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:24,719
discussion with luis

2469
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,560
for now the current approach of the

2470
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:29,280
draft is to extend the

2471
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,840
rfc 5695

2472
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,199
the alternative can be to rewrite some

2473
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:36,800
text from

2474
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,520
that rfc and to create one more

2475
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,520
convenient document for the reader

2476
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,840
otherwise we can just refer

2477
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,360
to

2478
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,119
the text of

2479
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:48,960
of that lfc

2480
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:52,880
in addition rfc 5695 as i said includes

2481
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,199
only one label in the stack so

2482
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,760
it may be needed to test more labels to

2483
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,679
support us a policy

2484
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,600
also in this case we may be we need to

2485
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,960
discuss how many labels is

2486
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,840
can be a reasonable reasonable number so

2487
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,760
this but in any case the number of

2488
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,560
labels must be reported

2489
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,520
um

2490
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,560
in addition a good point that was raised

2491
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,600
by lewis was the

2492
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,840
opportunity to consider

2493
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:26,159
additional background traffic in place

2494
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,600
so he suggests to add also these

2495
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,360
scenarios

2496
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,239
um and another point is about the

2497
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:36,639
traffic engineering test

2498
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:38,800
because we noticed that usually in

2499
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,960
benchmarking working group

2500
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,600
traffic engineering was in a separate

2501
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:47,199
document for example we see

2502
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:48,520
rfc

2503
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,360
6894 that is separate from

2504
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,080
uh

2505
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:55,520
56 94 5. so

2506
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,199
also in this case your input will be

2507
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:59,360
welcome to see if we have to include

2508
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,440
also the traffic engineering test in

2509
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,520
this document or we can keep in a

2510
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,600
separate one

2511
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,000
uh of course we also are open to new

2512
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,440
co-authors new contributors and welcome

2513
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,119
comments so

2514
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:15,839
thank you

2515
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:19,440
that's great uh thanks uh giuseppe um

2516
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,760
any any questions and and comments at

2517
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,000
this point

2518
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,239
okay well um

2519
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:31,840
uh let me let me get things started

2520
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:36,400
because i've read the draft uh the um

2521
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,080
one one other thing i one of the things

2522
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,400
i saw is that uh

2523
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,400
when it comes to the throughput and

2524
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,679
latency

2525
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:46,880
and and other measurements that uh

2526
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,199
that are you know were originally

2527
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:51,920
defined in rfc 2544

2528
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,040
um

2529
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,040
there's there's been some sort of

2530
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,960
piecewise updates

2531
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,960
uh to the way these measurements are

2532
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,560
made for example

2533
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,320
um

2534
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,679
when um

2535
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:05,600
uh

2536
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,080
when when one of our uh

2537
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,239
collaborators here uh

2538
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:11,600
um

2539
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,480
was was doing the initial work on uh

2540
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:17,600
uh state uh you know uh

2541
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,119
state transition

2542
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:22,840
um and i think it's i think it's rfc

2543
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,400
8219.

2544
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,719
but memory escapes me at the moment and

2545
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:28,320
in any case we'll we'll get that right

2546
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,320
number for you but the um

2547
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,119
uh

2548
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:33,119
like i said we've kind of been updating

2549
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:35,199
rfc 2544

2550
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:38,560
on a sort of a section by section basis

2551
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,600
and

2552
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,199
right now the test equipment that

2553
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:42,800
generally measures

2554
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,000
um

2555
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,880
rfc 2544 systems

2556
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:49,280
does a lot more with latency than the

2557
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:52,560
original 2544 anticipated that equipment

2558
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,520
could do

2559
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:56,159
so um you know this idea of measuring if

2560
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:58,239
you went back and read it giuseppe you

2561
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:00,080
you saw that it's a measurement of a

2562
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,360
single packet

2563
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,760
and uh you know we we just can't stand

2564
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,800
that anymore so um you know at least the

2565
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,239
the test equipment that's out there

2566
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:11,440
today will do a uh like a minimum uh

2567
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,280
latency a maximum

2568
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,639
and an average

2569
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,360
and um we we have some aspirational

2570
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,080
stuff in this uh i think it you know the

2571
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,159
the rfc that i'm talking about

2572
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:24,159
and um

2573
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:26,000
it would be it would be better to to

2574
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,920
reference uh like the latest uh latency

2575
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,560
measurement material uh along the way

2576
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,840
here so you know i i think um a few

2577
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,239
comments like that will help uh so that

2578
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,480
we're not kind of blindly referring back

2579
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,280
to

2580
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:44,159
um you know uh stuff from uh 20 years

2581
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,880
ago uh we we have made some changes and

2582
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:49,440
and uh it would be good to incorporate

2583
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,040
uh those references

2584
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,679
in the in the in your

2585
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:56,239
new draft

2586
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:59,040
i sure thank you thank you for coming i

2587
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:01,760
was not aware of this of

2588
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,480
documents so

2589
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,800
i will have a look and i will

2590
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,520
i will also integrate into the

2591
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,400
our draft also in relation as you said

2592
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,040
because we have to consider the minimum

2593
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,159
maximum average so more statistics data

2594
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:19,520
and

2595
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,840
yeah i will have a look and

2596
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:22,639
uh

2597
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:25,600
revise the draft of course

2598
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:26,639
and um

2599
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:28,639
one of the one other thing i would i

2600
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:31,199
would like you to consider is is uh

2601
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,199
you're if you're implementing any of

2602
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:36,000
these devices under test

2603
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,320
uh in a virtualized

2604
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,280
uh

2605
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,320
uh

2606
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:43,119
world virtualized networking and and

2607
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:44,639
instantiation

2608
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:47,199
um then you probably want to take a look

2609
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,719
at um

2610
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,520
a a a document from

2611
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,639
one of our

2612
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:53,840
sort of

2613
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,800
collaborating organizations that's uh

2614
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,960
the etsy uh network function

2615
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:02,159
virtualization uh test working group

2616
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:03,040
uh

2617
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,520
they have a document um which has been

2618
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,920
updated fairly frequently on on

2619
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,800
benchmarking in the uh you know in the

2620
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,960
virtualized test environment

2621
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,880
so um and and there's some good

2622
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,960
suggestions there about

2623
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,280
um you know additional measurements that

2624
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:20,560
can be made

2625
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:21,920
and

2626
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,159
you know additional stuff on latency

2627
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:26,960
uh back-to-back testing in fact yeah we

2628
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:30,080
have we have an update on the rfc 2544

2629
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,639
back-to-back uh testing procedure which

2630
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:33,600
i think

2631
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:37,760
i think is rfc 9002

2632
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:40,239
and with that update it's a much more

2633
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:41,280
viable

2634
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,560
and uh

2635
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,719
useful benchmark to measure

2636
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:45,760
um

2637
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,760
so you might consider including that as

2638
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,520
well i don't think i saw that in your

2639
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:52,320
list of uh

2640
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,760
benchmarks it's the back-to-back frame

2641
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:58,080
benchmark

2642
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,159
yes yes i

2643
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:04,080
i will look at also this document i

2644
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,960
yeah i i saw that there was this update

2645
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,159
of rfc 2544

2646
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:12,400
but yeah i didn't have time to

2647
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,800
to look at it but i will do yeah

2648
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,320
and in case of course the use of

2649
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:19,040
the

2650
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:23,600
maybe an additional scenario of the

2651
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:24,719
of

2652
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:27,440
the visualize my machine is also

2653
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,199
interesting to to be evaluated of course

2654
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:32,880
yeah that that's kind of a window for

2655
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,719
you to you know try out some of these

2656
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:37,679
tests and and like you just saw with uh

2657
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:39,760
in uh in tron's uh

2658
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,800
presentation and and earlier earlier

2659
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,840
today with uh veraco's uh presentation

2660
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:49,040
um the uh yeah the i mean the this is a

2661
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,920
testing uh working group and um

2662
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:53,600
everybody resonates when they see

2663
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,000
testing results so you know if you

2664
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
really want to grab everybody's interest

2665
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,840
uh you know put some graphs or some

2666
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,719
tables up on the on your charts and and

2667
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,480
the blood will really start flowing here

2668
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,440
okay

2669
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,920
yeah yeah sure um this is just an

2670
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,080
initial proposal also to to see the

2671
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,600
interest of of course we

2672
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:16,320
we aim to improve

2673
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,239
and also to receive your feedback

2674
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:19,520
because

2675
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:20,960
yeah we find that

2676
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,360
the the possibility to benchmark segment

2677
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:24,960
routing can be

2678
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,199
a good tool for

2679
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:30,239
operator or for for

2680
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:33,440
people that would like to

2681
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,960
to deploy this technology so that's why

2682
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,679
i think it's important but

2683
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:42,000
we also want your feedback to

2684
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,320
considering your experience

2685
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,400
to integrate and to

2686
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,400
make the comment the document more

2687
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,560
useful for people

2688
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,040
yeah yeah sure and and my my thought at

2689
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,760
the moment is to keep te out of out of

2690
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,280
scope for now

2691
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,360
uh let's see what uh

2692
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:00,800
what progress

2693
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,000
uh

2694
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
you can make with uh you know the

2695
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,199
suggestions i gave you today and and uh

2696
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:08,719
and actually running some tests i think

2697
01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:10,560
that would be good as well so

2698
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,679
no no

2699
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:13,440
yeah

2700
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,760
all right and then uh you're up for the

2701
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:19,040
next one here oh uh we have um we have a

2702
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:23,760
comment from eduardo v please go ahead

2703
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:27,840
do you hear me

2704
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,639
yes i hear you now okay okay fine i i

2705
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:32,960
have a question to to the working group

2706
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,760
uh about background traffic uh it may be

2707
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,239
very different different

2708
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:40,480
do you know anybody of you do you know

2709
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,280
any rfc or any maybe even draft okay

2710
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,599
draft is enough where background has

2711
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:47,760
been specified the ground traffic

2712
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,920
because uh it's difficult to guess what

2713
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,119
it could be

2714
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:54,080
it may be very different

2715
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:57,119
yeah yeah um

2716
01:49:57,119 --> 01:50:01,119
it's it's not typical that um

2717
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:03,119
the benchmarking methodology working

2718
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,119
group talks about uh

2719
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:06,719
background traffic

2720
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:08,719
usually you know we're in an isolated

2721
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:10,480
lab setup

2722
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:13,360
all the traffic is synthesized traffic

2723
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:15,679
and it comes from the test equipment and

2724
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:18,159
uh and you know and and goes back to the

2725
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:19,440
test equipment

2726
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:20,880
and um

2727
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,080
uh

2728
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,040
so

2729
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,599
uh we're we're not really

2730
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:28,159
we're not really um

2731
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:29,679
sort of setting a

2732
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:32,560
like a real world uh you know an attempt

2733
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,280
to um

2734
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,639
simulate real world traffic in any way

2735
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,560
it's it's all test traffic

2736
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,840
uh does that kind of answer your

2737
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,119
question

2738
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:44,880
okay okay

2739
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:47,679
answer no uh he is the answer to because

2740
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:49,920
yeah if nobody did it before then it

2741
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:52,320
sounds for you

2742
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:53,040
there

2743
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,800
by the way there is a there is a draft

2744
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,960
that's sort of attempting to do that in

2745
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,199
the uh responsiveness

2746
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:02,159
uh measurement area but that's in the ip

2747
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:04,400
performance metrics working group

2748
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,599
and um

2749
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:07,440
i i you know i think that you know

2750
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:09,119
they're they're still trying to to

2751
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:11,679
specify what it means to have like a

2752
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,840
working level of load

2753
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,520
and uh you know they're they're

2754
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,080
currently doing that on the basis of uh

2755
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,199
good put

2756
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:21,440
and uh and an innovative

2757
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:24,560
algorithm to do that um but like i said

2758
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:25,840
we're we're

2759
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,840
we're not touching anything like that so

2760
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:28,719
um

2761
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:32,000
uh but if you go to the uh ippm working

2762
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,119
groups um agenda from monday first

2763
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:36,239
session

2764
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:37,840
you should be able to find that draft on

2765
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,719
responsiveness fairly easily

2766
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:42,400
thanks thanks

2767
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,799
yes sure

2768
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,000
so for the moment i'll your suggestion

2769
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,880
is to keep the background traffic

2770
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,599
out of scope so and let's see later

2771
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,719
yeah it's um i mean unless i understand

2772
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,880
it better i think it's it's it's

2773
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,360
it's more more appropriate just to go

2774
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:04,560
with

2775
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:05,840
you know the way we've done things in

2776
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,760
the past year it seems like all your

2777
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:10,000
references go that way so that's what i

2778
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:10,800
would

2779
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,280
uh suggest so let's look at the piece

2780
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:16,080
let's look at the v6 uh segment routing

2781
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,400
yeah yeah okay

2782
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,719
uh yeah you can go on next slide maybe

2783
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:23,119
yeah the let's say the background is the

2784
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:24,320
same but

2785
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,000
um

2786
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,320
right right so i'm giving you i'm so i'm

2787
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:32,000
giving you less time oh yeah

2788
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,239
next

2789
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:38,320
yeah the background is the same so

2790
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:41,520
but it applies to another rfc

2791
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,280
that is the rfc

2792
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,760
5180

2793
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,599
that they find the benchmark methodology

2794
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:50,400
for ipv6 devices

2795
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,000
a segment routing

2796
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,719
can be applied to a pv6 data plane

2797
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:55,920
so

2798
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:58,880
this new draft aims to complement rfc

2799
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,880
5180

2800
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,080
by defining the methodology for

2801
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:06,159
benchmarking srv6

2802
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:08,639
so next

2803
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:09,840
the

2804
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:13,040
let's say in comparison with the

2805
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:17,760
mpls rfc now with srv6 there are

2806
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,679
more changes to

2807
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:22,400
the ipv6 architecture also if you go in

2808
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:25,040
six months there was a new draft that

2809
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:28,639
analyzed all the change of the srv6 to

2810
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:32,880
ipv6 architecture because with srv6 a

2811
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,800
new type of routing header has been

2812
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:37,360
defined the segment is encoded as an

2813
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:39,840
ipv6

2814
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,560
and then sr policy is

2815
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:47,760
is an ordered list of srv6c in the srh

2816
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:50,239
there are three categories of nodes that

2817
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:53,360
in this case are look similar to the esr

2818
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,199
mpls behavior

2819
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:57,920
so the source node that is the end node

2820
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,800
that steal the packet into an nsr policy

2821
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:04,239
the transit node that forwards packet

2822
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:08,400
as a normal ipv6 packet and the sr

2823
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,480
endpoint node that

2824
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,159
received packet

2825
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:13,040
was

2826
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:15,520
destination address is configured

2827
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,000
locally as a segment and so

2828
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,719
it replaced the ipv6 destination address

2829
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:23,199
with the new active segment

2830
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:24,000
so

2831
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,880
this is just to recap the srv6 operation

2832
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,440
so next

2833
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:34,480
and in addition to the basic srv6 packet

2834
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:37,599
processing there is also the srv6

2835
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:39,599
network programming model that has been

2836
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:43,360
defined in the rfc 8986 that describe a

2837
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:45,040
new sector function

2838
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:48,960
because the 128 bit of the seed can be

2839
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,440
split into three different fields

2840
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:54,239
locator function and arguments and

2841
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:57,360
the list of behaviors is specified

2842
01:54:57,360 --> 01:55:00,400
as a subset of function that can be

2843
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:03,679
also tested to benchmark the srv6

2844
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:04,719
network

2845
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:06,719
network programming capability so this

2846
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:09,040
is an additional let's say

2847
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:10,880
things that we have to consider with the

2848
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,040
srv6 that we didn't

2849
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:17,360
have we don't have with srm pls

2850
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:19,839
next slide

2851
01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:25,360
yeah regarding the test methodology also

2852
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,520
in this case there are some similarity

2853
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:31,040
with rfc 51

2854
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:31,840
regarding 80

2855
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,400
example the device under test connected

2856
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,440
to the test tool

2857
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,520
also

2858
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,679
regarding the test topology may be

2859
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:44,320
considered the same as in the previous

2860
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,080
document

2861
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,719
and the frame characteristics

2862
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:49,840
also be

2863
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:52,960
also considering that in rfc 5180 there

2864
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,000
are

2865
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,239
several considerations on the ipv6

2866
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:58,560
addressing space that can be considered

2867
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:01,440
so we can keep the same consideration

2868
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:02,400
also

2869
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,360
here

2870
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:06,159
next slide

2871
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:11,119
yeah as i mentioned for

2872
01:56:11,119 --> 01:56:15,360
srv6 there are more changes to do

2873
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,920
first of all the first change is similar

2874
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,840
so we need to support

2875
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:23,440
extension for igp protocols that are

2876
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:24,880
also defined

2877
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:26,960
in several documents

2878
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:30,400
um but the first big limitation in the

2879
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,560
nfc 5180

2880
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:33,679
is uh

2881
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:36,159
that it recommends a limited extension

2882
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:39,360
header chain for testing

2883
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:42,320
i have reported that it includes routing

2884
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,639
adder of

2885
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:47,760
maximum 32 bit bytes

2886
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,159
destination option adder fragment adder

2887
01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:52,880
and this is not enough considering

2888
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,360
the typical scenario of the srv6

2889
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,800
deployment

2890
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,679
because for example the length of s h is

2891
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:00,719
n

2892
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:04,239
plus 16 plus 8 bytes where n is number

2893
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:08,000
of segments and if we consider

2894
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:10,560
a number of segments of course that is

2895
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,639
that is greater than one

2896
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:15,040
uh the limitation of and

2897
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:17,960
the limited extension other chain of rfc

2898
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:23,440
5180 is um is not enough for srv6

2899
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:25,280
so

2900
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,679
maybe we need to do this change

2901
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:30,560
and in addition we have to add

2902
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:32,080
more parameters

2903
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,800
the type of nodes the number of segments

2904
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,639
in the sh

2905
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:39,040
the characteristic of extension either

2906
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:42,800
chain that maybe need to be redefined

2907
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:45,920
and also the behavior in terms of

2908
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,599
network programming

2909
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:50,239
model as i mentioned before

2910
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:53,239
next

2911
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,400
yeah we maybe we can skip this light so

2912
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,560
um

2913
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:03,280
for uh just for sake of time

2914
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:04,800
uh this

2915
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,320
slide just described the basic

2916
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:11,599
tests that are already defined in ipv6

2917
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:14,800
forwarding case but need to be added in

2918
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,000
this new document because we have to

2919
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,800
distinguish between the processing of

2920
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,320
sr source node sr endpoint node and sr

2921
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,719
transit node

2922
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:29,440
so new tests need to be added

2923
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,960
here

2924
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,159
because this

2925
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:34,400
let's say classification was not of

2926
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:37,679
course included in rfc 5180

2927
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:38,880
next is live

2928
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,880
i think is the last one

2929
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:43,599
so we are on time yeah the also in this

2930
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:46,159
case there are some pending points and

2931
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:49,199
feedback is welcome the first point is

2932
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:51,440
similar to srm pls

2933
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:53,119
the second point is what are the

2934
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:56,239
functions that we we must test so we

2935
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:58,320
need to consider all the

2936
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,040
behavior that are included in nfc89 nfc

2937
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:05,360
8986 are just a subset of that

2938
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:07,119
additional

2939
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:09,280
question there is an activity on

2940
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,040
compressed seed

2941
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:11,760
so

2942
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:13,920
should we cover also compressed seed

2943
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,119
tests

2944
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:17,679
but we should consider that the

2945
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:19,760
reference document is still in progress

2946
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,119
so

2947
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:26,000
we we may add these in a future version

2948
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,840
then okay the question on background

2949
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:31,040
traffic that you already answered

2950
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,199
and the question on traffic engineers

2951
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:34,880
that you already answered so basically

2952
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:36,800
yeah the third second and third

2953
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:37,920
questions

2954
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:42,880
are typic are specific for srv6ks

2955
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:47,599
so yeah thank you and welcome comments

2956
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:50,800
okay eduard you're in the queue please

2957
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,040
go ahead

2958
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:55,119
a little bit comment more about function

2959
01:59:55,119 --> 01:59:57,520
because in the service six a function is

2960
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,280
not just uh

2961
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:02,560
like vpn services like layer 3p and uh

2962
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,119
for some transistors transit nodes uh

2963
02:00:05,119 --> 02:00:07,199
there is there are functions like and

2964
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:09,679
and x and t it's for transit nodes

2965
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:11,280
therefore

2966
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,599
we could not include function at all we

2967
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:14,639
couldn't

2968
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:16,880
include or in in the test function which

2969
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,560
is related only for transit nodes

2970
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:20,480
effectively for

2971
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,040
for transport effectively and uh of

2972
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,639
course we could include all functions

2973
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:26,800
but all functions the huge list which i

2974
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,400
doubt should be included here because

2975
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:29,840
all functions is

2976
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,880
already already vpn and vpn is a

2977
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:34,639
typically different different document

2978
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:36,480
probably probably vpn should not be

2979
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:39,199
included but about transit functions and

2980
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:41,440
and x and x is for traffic engineering

2981
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:44,239
especially uh for index uh because it's

2982
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:45,760
traffic engineering and maybe traffic

2983
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,840
engineering stuff is the different

2984
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,760
document maybe index should not be

2985
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,000
included i don't know therefore it's a

2986
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,679
question

2987
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:56,880
sorry for for interruption

2988
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:00,400
that's good thank you yeah

2989
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:02,880
yeah so um

2990
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:07,599
uh any response to that uh giuseppe

2991
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:10,320
uh no this is something that i also put

2992
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:12,080
in the slide so what are the functions

2993
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:14,320
should we consider only the basic and

2994
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:18,080
then tax oh yeah or those define the

2995
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:22,800
complete list of rfc8986 so yeah this is

2996
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,639
something we can do a proposal but we

2997
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:26,719
also need feedback to

2998
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:29,199
from the community from the operators

2999
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:30,080
uh

3000
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:32,239
that is one of the main points that we

3001
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:34,480
want to address for example by the next

3002
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,679
meeting

3003
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:36,480
okay

3004
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:39,599
more feedback from operators yeah

3005
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:42,000
yeah so i so i think you're really going

3006
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,320
to have to beat the drum about this to

3007
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:46,960
to get the feedback you want um the

3008
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:48,880
quick feedback i can give you because

3009
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:51,440
we've reached the end of our uh session

3010
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:53,360
is um uh you know we've got this

3011
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:54,320
reference

3012
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:55,760
through uh

3013
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:58,080
51 80 uh

3014
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,159
to 2544

3015
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:02,879
and um

3016
02:02:03,199 --> 02:02:05,199
there's even less about there's even

3017
02:02:05,199 --> 02:02:07,360
less about uh

3018
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:10,159
the actual procedures of throughput and

3019
02:02:10,159 --> 02:02:12,880
latency and and uh other forms of

3020
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:15,280
benchmarking in in uh

3021
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:17,920
the actual test procedures in 5180 i

3022
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:20,639
think it was it was pretty most of the

3023
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:22,560
most of the sections on on throughput

3024
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:23,920
latency and so forth were pretty

3025
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:27,360
transparent and just pointed to 2544

3026
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,400
so

3027
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:30,320
like i said you know a lot of that stuff

3028
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:32,000
has been updated and we've got to

3029
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,159
collect the right the things for you to

3030
02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:37,360
be referencing separate

3031
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:40,000
sections of more up-to-date documents

3032
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,760
and and that will be a good thing

3033
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,280
yeah this will be great if you can point

3034
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,000
out

3035
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,920
to these uh

3036
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:53,040
more updated stuff more updated rfc how

3037
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:56,159
we can include and read of course

3038

a look through our literature uh uh

3041
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,840

02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:09,520
you'll stumble over some of these things

3043

as well yourself so uh yeah you know

3044
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,280

3045
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,480

3046
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:16,719

updated anything more than once from rfc

3054

updates 2544 it's it's probably a good
