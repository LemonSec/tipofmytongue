attend our ace working group session

10
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,120
so as a gentle reminder here's the note

11
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,120
well

12
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
here are the different meeting tips for

13
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,440
those who are all

14
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,079
removed as well

15
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
okay here's the agenda for today first

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,239
is going to be virtual status

17
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
second item on the agenda is uh draft

18
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040
key

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,319
group com mp com osco

20
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,440
and third is the pub sub profile

21
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,519
including revoked token notification

22
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,400
so

23
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
um i'll hand over to danielle

24
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,720
yeah so let's check the status where we

25
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,319
are

26
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,800
so first of all we would like to thank

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,599
ben

28
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,959
and

29
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,239
after the status uh i will give you

30
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,360
um the i'll give him the mic

31
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
so he can think of about what he's gonna

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,159
going to say while i'm presenting the

33
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,959
status he won't be upset

34
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,680
so

35
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
i think we would like to thank you for

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
um all the follow-up and the work you

37
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,879
did

38
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,239
um

39
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
and um

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,200
let's see where we are now so

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,319
um

42
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,760
we have a bunch of rfcs in the queue

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,799
so we have the recently the iaf

44
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,519
we have the co-op east gtls authorized

45
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,480
oauth sperms oscorp profile

46
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,040
um so it's unclear to me when they're

47
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,680
going to be published but

48
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,519
i hope the internet is not going to

49
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,519
collapse because everyone is waiting for

50
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,080
those to be published

51
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,400
we have a few other documents that are

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,159
80 revision

53
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,760
so

54
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,358
i'm thinking of the the cmpv2

55
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,798
um

56
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,720
the mqtt

57
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,199
and the keygroup come

58
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,000
so

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
i

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,080
i don't exactly know um how this is

61
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
going to be handled um

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,360
um

63
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
are you gonna i mean

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,759
is it do you think ben you you will be

65
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,639
able to send them to publication or

66
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,720
um will be will they be handled by um

67
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
paul or rahman

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
that might be some other question we

69
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
we have

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,120
and we do have a some uh draft that are

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,360
uh in various stages of the working

72
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,400
group last call so we had a problem

73
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,759
with the co-app eep

74
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,080
that has not been sent to the isg but

75
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
that's going to be fixed

76
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,560
tomorrow we just lately realized that

77
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,880
when we sent it we had an issue with the

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,080
shepherd that prevent it to be sent but

79
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,759
um it's

80
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,840
it's um it's really fixable it's just

81
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
that we didn't we realized that too late

82
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,039
um there is the extended dtls authorized

83
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,840
so it's also waiting for shepard

84
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,639
if anyone is willing to volunteer um i

85
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,960
mean he's more one than welcome

86
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,280
and we have the key group como score

87
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,160
which is um

88
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,840
receiving some comments uh so it's a

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
long working group let's go process but

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
maybe um marco is going to

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,240
to say a few words on that

92
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,479
um now where the the working group is

93
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,880
heading is we have three uh document

94
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,319
um the pub sub profile

95
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,680
um it's unclear if sigdam is um

96
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,759
online and maybe she wants to add

97
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,800
something

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
but um um

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,800
i mean there are still some

100
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
some point to to be addressed in that

101
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,840
document

102
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,600
um

103
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,120
and we have two drafts that are um

104
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,080
new or not so new in that working group

105
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,159
so and these are going to be presented

106
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
at this time

107
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,160
my question for

108
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,039
i mean it's more than one co-author so

109
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,600
um is that do we think that we can ship

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
those drafts uh to the isg by july

111
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,039
and um that's that's all

112
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,080
so

113
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,919
maybe i can

114
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,360
give the mic to ben and if anyone has

115
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
anything to oh i see francesca in the

116
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,479
line

117
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,280
please go ahead

118
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,919
hi uh not just about the agenda we

119
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,000
didn't do agenda bashing but as one of

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,560
the co-authors of the pub sub

121
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
profile i don't think it should be on

122
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
the agenda um sig dem is not here she's

123
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,039
not uh in the meeting

124
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,599
and there was no update for this meeting

125
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,960
so

126
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,479
yeah okay so okay yeah um the current

127
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,120
agenda is on the edge and uh i've

128
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
removed that one no problem

129
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,520
okay great um

130
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,479
yeah so it's been a fun time working

131
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,639
through all of this stuff past few years

132
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,160
um

133
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,240
that was a good reminder about the

134
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,400
status of some of the outstanding

135
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,879
documents i think the

136
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,560
uh cmpv2 co-op transport is probably not

137
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,720
going to get approved

138
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
in the next

139
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
day

140
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,280
but i will definitely take a look at the

141
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,039
co-op east and i think the

142
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,680
mqtt profile i'm going to try real hard

143
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,199
to get sent to the rfc editor

144
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,960
before

145
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,879
things hand off i know that

146
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,919
syndema posted an update and i've been

147
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,400
asking the remaining two discuss holders

148
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,280
to take a look and hopefully clear and

149
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,599
then i'll review the death myself before

150
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,680
sending it off

151
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,049
um but that's probably the the main

152
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,129
[Music]

153
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,839
changes from the current state that i

154
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,679
expect before my term fully expires

155
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,279
we do have

156
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,159
the

157
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,800
sort of core for documents

158
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,200
and the rfc editor as well but i think

159
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
there's still a couple of

160
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,080
final edits to make things consistent

161
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
across the cluster of documents that we

162
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,680
want to do so we're going to try and not

163
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,519
rush this out with my sense

164
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
thanks okay thank you

165
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,680

175
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,000
so let's move on to

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,839
the agenda

177
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,560
key group come

178
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,200
maybe just a question paul are you to be

179
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,440
our 80 or

180
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
for ace or is it not this discussed

181
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,079
yes i will be

182
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,160
okay right

183
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,399
uh i guess one question while i'm still

184
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,440
up

185
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,800
uh are you intending to be sharing the

186
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
slides right now i'm not seeing them

187
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,079
come through i'm not sure if they're

188
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,839
showing up in the room or not

189
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,079
so i think we're waiting for marco

190
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,000
hi daniel um so ask your calm i think

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
shouldn't be in the agenda actually

192
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
because it's under ad review right now i

193
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,839
have no updates on that since last time

194
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,160
though and yeah it's the group come os

195
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,320
cor i think on the agenda right that's

196
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,000
in the agenda uh

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,720
so i think you should share the slides

198
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,880
through me tech okay right

199
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,440
i'm on site by the way so

200
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,320
i can see you

201
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,360
so let me check pre-load slides

202
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,920
share please

203
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,839
okay so you're doing it logan good

204
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,320
great uh thank you uh yes this is a

205
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,880
shared update for the latest revision of

206
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,519
giger komol score uh next slide please

207
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,279
yeah most of the updates at this round

208
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,760
were editorial or editorial plus

209
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,240
actually as triggered by changes done in

210
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,640
the group score document

211
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,600
in core

212
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
and just to mention the main ones some

213
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,279
functionalities of the group manager

214
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,600
were declared as optional so this is now

215
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,519
also reflected here

216
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,760
and it was agreed to have a clear-cut

217
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,399
distinction between the the concepts of

218
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,720
public key and authentication credential

219
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,639
that is also reflected here together

220
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,600
with

221
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,160
renaming some related parameters and

222
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,399
rephrasing text around them

223
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,560
and about this i think i took care of

224
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
all the parameters actually

225
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
defined in this document

226
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,959
but this document is also inheriting

227
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,839
some parameters about these aspects from

228
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,279
asking group com

229
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,600
that i prefer not to touch

230
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,880
since it is under ad

231
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,880
and authentication review

232
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,519
anything that started in sk group

233
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,480
comment was inherited here is untouched

234
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
for now and my plan is for when

235
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,320
addressing the ad review for ace

236
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,519
gigercom

237
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,760
taking care of those in that document

238
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,560
and in this one

239
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
all right

240
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,600
and next time just a clarification

241
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,639
um do do you end it's unclear to me if

242
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,639
you intend

243
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,639
to change the key group com

244
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,480
document

245
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,399
there will be changes to do about this

246
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,399
about parameter names is nothing

247
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,360
functional it's editorial plus

248
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,720
i'd like to think

249
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,639
but yeah it's a matter of consistency

250
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,600
with

251
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,519
well the grupo score document in core to

252
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,440
start with

253
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,680
and i plan to do that as part of the 80

254
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,199
review processing when it comes

255
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,240
okay

256
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,680
next slide please

257
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,920
uh right it was also an opportunity to

258
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,480
do some some fix and update in the uh

259
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
ayana registrations

260
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,040
uh about the integer register to declare

261
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,279
explicit to the format of scope used

262
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,920
here and also following the the last

263
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,079
call reviews and other reviews for the

264
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,120
aif document now approved i also

265
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,519
uh make related registrations uh more

266
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,199
consistent

267
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,120
and i noticed once this document was

268
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
already submitted that some text about

269
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,920
af again has to be improved here to be

270
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,480
aligned it was agreed after some last

271
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,240
call comments on um aif as well so what

272
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
you see at the end of this slide is

273
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
actually what's left to do is related to

274
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,800
af

275
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,720
that i plan to take at the

276
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,440
next revision

277
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,560
next slide please

278
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,360
yes so that was the status for this

279
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,839
revision which is aligned by the way

280
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,440
functionally which is the most important

281
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,519
thing to the group of score document um

282
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,639
in core

283
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,639
uh the document is formally under

284
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,800
working group plus call and and we got a

285
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,199
review from from yoran uh thank you very

286
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,800
much for that

287
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
as far as understood this uh the first

288
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,079
part of the review actually uh which is

289
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,920
mostly about um

290
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,800
trying to enforce uh a new structure

291
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,120
of the content in the document and and

292
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,760
based on this uh new structure when

293
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
enforced

294
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
understand more comments on the actual

295
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,199
content

296
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,480
will come back

297
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
so my plan is of course to start working

298
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,199
on this restructuring first part

299
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,959
as soon as possible for convenience i

300
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,880
suppose it's just better to submit any

301
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,240
version

302
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
and then the work can continue there

303
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,199
on applying actual comments

304
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,720
and

305
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,519
right

306
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,440
i mentioned already the the thinking

307
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,199
that will be required with ace giggle

308
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,160
calm about those pending parameters uh

309
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,440
when the ad review comes from sql comma

310
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
and i also got some comments from

311
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,519
francesca as a cd about syncing the

312
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,240
request for publications from document

313
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,959
in ace and core around this topic so

314
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,120
it'd be good and convenient for the isg

315
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,800
to receive together

316
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,160
three documents

317
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,959
this one we are discussing here

318
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,600
and two documents in core uh mentioned

319
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,759
here one of which is approaching working

320
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,120
group let's call

321
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,199
the other one as finished it

322
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,079
and should soon go to shepherd right up

323
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,440
and yeah overall changes can still come

324
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,759
up and needed to be done i hope no not

325
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,040
fundamental

326
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
as this cluster of document

327
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,880
moves forward

328
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,720
i think that's just unavoidable and we

329
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,079
have to live with that but it's fine

330
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
yeah and that would be it from my side

331
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,959
okay good any questions

332
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,839
now and so next next presentation

333
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,639
that should be gm admin

334
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
right uh thank you and we are in version

335
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,119
five with this one it was a pretty big

336
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,839
update i would say uh next slide please

337
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,480
uh so to recap the goal of this document

338
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
is to define a restful

339
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,199
interface at the oscar group manager but

340
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,799
intended for

341
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,039
ace clients acting as administrators so

342
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,199
they are supposed to create configure

343
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,880
delete all score groups

344
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,679
at that group manager

345
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,799
next slide please it's even clearer how

346
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,720
admin resources are organized at the

347
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,240
group manager here

348
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
so you're supposed to have a single

349
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,840
group collection

350
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,160
resource as a main entry point for an

351
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
administrator

352
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,320
and operations that resource uh allows

353
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
the administrator to retrieve the list

354
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,720
of existing groups uh possibly verifying

355
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,559
grained or partially using fetch rather

356
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,480
than get

357
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,400
or creating a new group

358
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
through a post request and the result of

359
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
that is practically creating a child

360
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,840
resource uh or group configuration

361
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,880
resource

362
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,120
which is storing uh the actual

363
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
parameters of different kind composing

364
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
uh the current configuration of the

365
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,200
oscar group but then in turn the

366
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,000
administrator can interact precisely

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
with one of those group configuration

368
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
resources

369
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,760
for the sake of retrieving the current

370
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,840
configuration of that group entirely or

371
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,679
partially

372
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,320
overrided entirely or or updated

373
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,480
selectively or deleted meaning

374
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,760
deleting the group

375
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,799
next slide please

376
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,320
so we made a couple of changes starting

377
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,520
with

378
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,200
was anyone talking

379
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,440
no my impression uh

380
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,840
some changes were very similar to those

381
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,200
i mentioned for for the previous

382
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,559
document

383
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,480
about changing some parameter names and

384
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,559
phrasing about distinguishing between

385
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
public and authentication credential but

386
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,679
again editorial plus

387
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,120
we tried to simplify it a little bit um

388
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,360
in the processing of creating a new

389
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,080
group from the administrator

390
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,679
is it is still possible for the

391
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,520
administrator when creating a new group

392
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,160
to suggest a name to assign to that

393
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,120
group

394
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,960
to the group manager and the group

395
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,080
manager still has the final word about

396
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,240
the exact group name to assign to that

397
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,640
group that has to be available first of

398
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
all and and fine uh for whatever reason

399
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,640
uh to the group manager so what we had

400
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,039
before was that this the suggestion from

401
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,240
the administrator was entirely optional

402
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,799
but that complicates pretty much the

403
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,520
design space uh for the design of the

404
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,760
scope format that i'll introduce later

405
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,480
on

406
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,880
so we prefer to relax this little detail

407
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
and it should still be fine we believe

408
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,919
because there's still a lot of

409
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,080
flexibility

410
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,760
and it still leaves the final decision

411
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,160
to the group manager which is um the

412
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,120
most important thing um anyway

413
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,080
so it's uh relatively minor update but

414
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,840
still just to be well understood

415
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,158
okay uh next slide please

416
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,600
but um just um just a question the name

417
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,200
is actually only useful for the group

418
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
manager

419
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,440
uh sorry is it again used for the the

420
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
group name

421
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,000
it's just an identifier that that the

422
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,559
administrator can can refer to later

423
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,000
yeah it has not

424
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,840
meaning no it's just a

425
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,720
label

426
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,600
uh

427
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,520
okay

428
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,760
so can you move to the next slide i

429
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,919
think over there yeah right

430
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,840
we were

431
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,480
underspecifying

432
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,799
how exactly the group manager informs

433
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,960
the group member right after having

434
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,679
updated the configuration of the group

435
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,280
now we are more specific with that and

436
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,799
we are trying to reuse as much as

437
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,240
possible

438
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,880
content format message format and song

439
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,440
from keyground oscar which which is um

440
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,039
pretty nice

441
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,880
and and then we had in mind the possible

442
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,159
addition that we we haven't added yet i

443
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,840
really just prefer to confirm with the

444
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,400
group first if there are any objection

445
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,960
um as i mentioned before in recent

446
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,679
changes in the core document we have

447
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,480
made optional uh for the group manager

448
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,799
to support among other things

449
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,600
the recycling of group identifiers in

450
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,360
the group so if the group manager is

451
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
actually able to do that it would be

452
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,320
convenient too to extend the lifetime

453
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,360
of the

454
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,960
forever in principle

455
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,919
so it makes sense here i think uh to

456
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,919
have the administrator creating the

457
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,919
group explicitly

458
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,960
choosing if this has to happen or not of

459
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,559
course providing that the group manager

460
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,400
is supporting this

461
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,320
feature in the first place and this

462
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
would be pretty cheap and easy to do

463
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
it's just about adding one more

464
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,799
parameter in the group creation request

465
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,480
that the administrator can set to true

466
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,799
or false and if it is true and the group

467
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,039
manager does support this feature this

468
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,880
will actually happen

469
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,440
so i i couldn't think of anything really

470
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,080
better controversial here but before

471
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,400
moving on adding this little thing

472
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,240
just want it to be sure it's fine is

473
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,120
there any objection

474
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
her known so well i'll give it a try and

475
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,240
that it's relatively simple and then

476
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,080
it's probably even easier to review or

477
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,879
text them in this

478
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,039
okay

479
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,840
next slide please

480
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,960
right this is the bigger

481
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,039
change instead that we have postponed

482
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,520
for a long time and finally um we've

483
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,559
made it

484
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,120
and it started a long time ago because

485
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,440
so far we were not specifying the exact

486
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,919
format that scope should have

487
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,400
in a talking request response uh and in

488
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,120
the actual uh access token

489
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
it started with all input from from jim

490
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,760
schaden christianos uh jim shot on this

491
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,919
side imagine a workflow where the

492
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,840
administrator obtains the first token

493
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
posts it

494
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,240
uh and building on on the granted uh

495
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,000
operations and can perform it actually

496
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,880
creates two groups g1 g2 does something

497
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
with those okay

498
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,360
uh that token eventually expires

499
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,440
and the admin the administrator requests

500
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,080
for a new access token and posts it but

501
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,840
that will practically result in

502
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,919
establishing a new secure association

503
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,840
and secure identity for that

504
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,679
administrator and basically the group

505
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,600
manager cannot recognize that

506
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,679
administrator as exactly the previous

507
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,480
one

508
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,679
anymore

509
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,440
and this can be a complication because

510
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,120
we would like that administrator to

511
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,600
continue doing some things in the groups

512
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,240
it it created them itself

513
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,480
before but at the same time without

514
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,279
having to touch access policies at the

515
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,360
authorization server

516
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,919
anymore so this was just something nice

517
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,080
to be able to achieve somehow building

518
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,600
the scope

519
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,480
in a convenient way

520
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,640
if you move to the next slide please

521
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,720
then we also have the the input from

522
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,240
christian

523
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
that at some point of course noted uh

524
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,840
you're really focusing on one single

525
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,600
administrator doing potentially

526
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,559
everything

527
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,279
it'd be good to have beside that also a

528
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,440
different class of administrators like

529
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,279
able to do at least something

530
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,360
on groups that they didn't create

531
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,799
themselves but created by some other say

532
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,480
main administrator

533
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,799
so putting all this together and having

534
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,799
further discussion also with the

535
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,559
proponents and the coders

536
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,960
uh we started to sketch possible format

537
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
of scope we had placeholder text about

538
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,480
that in the previous version of the

539
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,000
draft

540
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,679
and now we have a full uh first

541
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,679
definition of this

542
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,159
in this revision instead that i can show

543
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,679
you in the in the next slides

544
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,200
can you move to the next slide please

545
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,600
thanks uh since we are going to use a

546
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,120
aif

547
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
of course we didn't have to start from

548
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,600
scratch and we thought of evolving the

549
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,919
af data model that we are using first of

550
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,320
all in the keygroup common score

551
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,039
document presented before

552
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,840
if you remember there we also defined a

553
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,320
scope based on aaf

554
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,120
where scope is a set of scope entries

555
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,320
and every entry specifies as a to id an

556
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,960
exact group name

557
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,559
and there the group names come again by

558
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,600
the way

559
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,600
and uh stephen the exact roles uh that

560
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,520
the the client only in the token can

561
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,360
have in that group so that's what

562
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,919
happens in that document but we can do

563
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,760
something kind of similar in our case

564
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,640
for the administrator now

565
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
next slide please

566
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,720
yeah still using aaf we basically define

567
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,400
the new af data model for administrators

568
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,559
which has a fundamental difference a to

569
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,240
id here is not an exact group name

570
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,919
it's rather a pattern of group names

571
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,880
and t-perm is again an integer to be

572
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,039
read as a bitmap

573
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,360
encoding the permissions that an

574
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,159
administrator has on any group

575
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,919
uh whose name matches with that

576
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,240
corresponding pattern

577
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,640
uh of course a set of permissions this

578
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
is not really like the rules of a member

579
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,720
we thought of permissions that can be

580
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
mapped to the operation that we have

581
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,240
defined on

582
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,159
on the interface for administrators so

583
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,080
retrieving list of groups creating

584
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,840
reading configuration updating

585
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,640
configuration uh deleting the group and

586
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,120
this should address uh both original

587
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,279
input from from jim and christian

588
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,600
uh james because he thinks in terms of

589
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,880
um

590
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,360
patterns of name not exact names anymore

591
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,200
so it's friendly with an administrator

592
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,120
asking for a new token following this

593
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,760
direction of the first one

594
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,360
and it also addresses christian points

595
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,600
we think because basically uh and

596
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,679
non-main administrator can just be

597
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,240
granted a token with a more restrictive

598
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,400
uh name pattern and with less

599
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,480
permissions than the original

600
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,880
uh main admin

601
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,600
uh

602
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
if you move to the next slide that

603
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,000
really summarizes uh making a parallel

604
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,960
with with the format used in keeger com

605
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,440
oscar instead so again scope would be a

606
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,520
collection of scope entries

607
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,679
where each has a pair named pattern and

608
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,679
integer encoding

609
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,600
the granted permissions to an

610
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,880
administrator

611
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,360
for any group whose name matches

612
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,840
that pattern

613
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,600
first of all any overall comment on this

614
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,279
direction use of aif

615
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,640
so i

616
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,880
maybe i have more more

617
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,640
more than a comment it's uh just a

618
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,600
question

619
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
um

620
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,320
i see that we're using the name of the

621
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,039
group um

622
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,559
as um

623
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,600
not

624
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,320
only a property for a specific group but

625
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,039
um uh it has some imperfect some

626
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,880
implications um

627
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,880
on access and uh

628
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,320
um

629
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,480
and things like that so

630
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,960
i was wondering if um

631
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,200
the group can have an id which is a

632
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,279
random number

633
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,440
uh for example and that

634
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,600
the name is actually one property is

635
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,960
associated to that id

636
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,440
instead of um then um

637
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,200
having i mean um

638
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,640
i'm just wondering if that's something

639
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,399
that would be

640
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,279
feasible or not visible in in our case

641
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,840
i i think it is visible and can boil

642
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,600
down to an implementation detail on the

643
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,960
group manager and how it generates names

644
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,640
uh but this started already with

645
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,880
keygroup score where names are used

646
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,360
already so groups are identified by a

647
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,679
text string name already included in

648
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,760
tokens for group members

649
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
but so this just builds on that thinking

650
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,440
on the first step when the administrator

651
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,720
creates the group

652
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,440
uh you you may use a group manager uh

653
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
yeah generate a random number if you

654
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,000
want and express that as a text string

655
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,799
and that's your name um sure that's

656
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,840
really about

657
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,360
yeah local preferences for the group

658
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
manager and you can do that

659
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,440
but it feels more friendly to have the

660
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
name ultimately expressed as a text ring

661
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,279
i think

662
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,480
yeah no

663
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,240
i mean oh ben is in the queue

664
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,840
yeah please go ahead go ahead and finish

665
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
your question daniel

666
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,960
no so what i was suggesting is that

667
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,520
when i say a random number it's a it's

668
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,760
an id that uh

669
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,840
has no meaning as opposed to a text

670
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,720
string

671
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,200
and then we attach to that

672
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,920
i am

673
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,200
[Music]

674
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,840
as i'm saying random but i should say oh

675
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,240
pack it's more opaque is more maybe

676
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,520
something yeah

677
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,039
like a

678
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,240
um

679
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,720
yeah an opaque identity

680
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,240
and then

681
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,279
you assign to that identity a name that

682
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,880
you can change it it's only one

683
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,440
properties

684
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,120
that was uh what i was suggesting

685
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,600
so changing it would be a problem

686
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,080
in fact something to be decided once and

687
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,080
and for all and living with that group

688
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,919
um all along

689
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,320
uh it's not exactly uh opaque right now

690
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,159
if you mean it doesn't have to be it

691
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,399
doesn't have to to have any english

692
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,360
meaning

693
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
yeah you you can have random characters

694
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,440
there but it's something that all the

695
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,000
parties involved have to understand here

696
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,840
for the sake of group discovery if you

697
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,360
want to and and request

698
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,399
yeah so i guess that's to me

699
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,720
i was just gonna say that you know

700
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,640
naming entities is one of the the

701
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,760
classic

702
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
challenging problems in computer science

703
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,519
and uh

704
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,919
it's obviously gonna be important for us

705
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,720
to be able to use some of the structure

706
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,080
of the names

707
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,799
as we represent permissions and

708
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,720
like the wild carding of the names to

709
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,919
help us

710
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,919
make our representation of the

711
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,679
permissions more efficiently encodable

712
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,440
but it seems like

713
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
because we're going to be using the

714
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,159
structure of the names in the access

715
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,440
model

716
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,519
we should be very clear when we first

717
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,760
introduce the concept of the group names

718
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,360
that the names do have an internal

719
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,919
structure and try to be as clear as we

720
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,120
can about the form of that structure

721
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,679
so that it's sort of intrinsic into the

722
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,440
concept of the group name

723
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,279
and we're not trying to

724
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,760
retrofit the structure on just in order

725
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,039
to apply the permissions to it

726
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,559
it should really be built in from the

727
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,879
start

728
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,240
thanks

729
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,840
yeah and of course we we really want to

730
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,519
hook this into aaf where uh well qid

731
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,240
supposed to be a text string

732
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,640
so everything fit naturally already when

733
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,120
working on key group of moscow um

734
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,440
i would say where that started

735
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,360
so in this respect about the exact group

736
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,279
name thing we are not adding anything

737
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,039
new here here the shift is thinking more

738
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,519
in terms of patterns of names

739
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,720
because we have a different problem but

740
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,840
okay uh thanks for the feedback uh

741
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,519
yeah if you can move to the next slide

742
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,519
please

743
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,000
yeah after having defined all this of

744
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,919
course we realized and then there are

745
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,080
some practical actions to take some of

746
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,519
the actors involved

747
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,559
uh so of course the the resource server

748
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,240
is to store that access token and be

749
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,480
sure when receiving a request to one of

750
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,720
those admin resources that

751
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,559
there is an access token first of all

752
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,559
and the scope in it has at least one

753
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,360
scope entry granting that exact uh

754
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,679
permission on that for for that group

755
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,279
name if matching with at least one

756
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,320
pattern

757
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,519
uh

758
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,039
details can change depending on the

759
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,679
exact request on the exact resource so

760
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,559
we had it for each resource handler an

761
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,960
exact list of steps to take

762
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,480
to perform this

763
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,440
access control checks

764
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,279
to our surprise we found that it's a bit

765
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,360
more complicated to describe well on the

766
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,000
authorization server actually

767
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,399
when the client requests an access token

768
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,240
so it requests for a certain scope and

769
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
at a high level the authorization server

770
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,720
has to compare that scope against what

771
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,880
can be granted to that client uh based

772
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,919
on the

773
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,640
uh pre-installed um access policies

774
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
uh to be better safe than sorry i think

775
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,080
we we got a bit carried away and find a

776
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
a judgment procedure at the

777
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,760
authorization server uh pretty much in

778
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,279
detail probably too much

779
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,760
uh so as a next step for for the next

780
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,000
revision i think you'd be better in

781
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
retrospect to have

782
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,559
such a detailed procedure as a text for

783
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,600
an appendix as an example of how the

784
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,280
authorization server can especially

785
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,399
perform

786
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,239
those checks and take those decisions

787
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,879
while we can reduce a lot the content in

788
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,719
that section of the document body just

789
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,679
saying that

790
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,440
the authorization server has to take a

791
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
decision comparing

792
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,839
the request against the access policies

793
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,239
as usual

794
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,800
any particular objection in making this

795
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,719
well all in all editorial improvement

796
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,320
improvement but i think

797
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,320
significant

798
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,279
here known so i'll give it a try

799
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,839
next slide please

800
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,399
and we're getting to the end i believe

801
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,199
uh yeah this is uh something to think

802
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,679
through i think it's a possible uh nice

803
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,359
optimization

804
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,520
there may be cases where the same ace

805
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,640
client uh wants to be is supposed to be

806
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,599
both administrator for some groups and

807
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,240
members of some other groups at the same

808
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,680
group manager

809
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,839
but still then we would really like to

810
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,800
have only one access token involved with

811
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,720
one pop key and so on

812
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,960
so italy would be good to have a single

813
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
access token with scope containing a mix

814
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,960
of scope entries for members and of

815
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,240
scope entries for administrators

816
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,640
and we think this is really easy to

817
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,680
achieve actually uh thinking of the way

818
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,760
we have especially encoded the the

819
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,480
permission part the perma so if you

820
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,280
remember in the af data model from ac

821
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,599
group como score for group members in

822
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,320
every scope entry t-perm has the least

823
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,560
significant bit reserved and always set

824
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,720
to zero well it's exactly the opposite

825
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,640
in the scope entries for administrators

826
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,960
where the last bit of t-perm is always

827
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,200
set to one meaning that

828
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
still with the name pattern playing a

829
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,320
big role uh every administrator has

830
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,920
basically the permission to retrieve the

831
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,359
list of existing

832
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,280
um groups so if you build this bag or

833
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,520
scope entries of different types within

834
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,760
the same scope you are able to trivially

835
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,079
distinguish those just by looking at at

836
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,320
the last bit

837
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,000
of tiper

838
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,320
so we were thinking to introduce this

839
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,480
possibility of course which is just a

840
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,599
plus

841
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,839
uh unless there are particular

842
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,480
objections or controversies anyone sees

843
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,440
here known either

844
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,920
what is the actually the the the

845
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,800
advantage of of because it seems to me

846
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,400
that we're trying to con

847
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,960
to mix some rules uh different rules and

848
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,079
i'm

849
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,240
just wondering if it's if it's going to

850
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,839
help or uh introduce some

851
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,240
uh it helps because you can stick to one

852
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,560
access token only

853
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,480
and and typically a resource server is

854
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,880
supposed to keep only one access token

855
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,040
per pop key per client

856
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,440
and you'd be able to to comply with this

857
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
requirement here keeping one access

858
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,599
token for the same ace client

859
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,280
i don't see any particular problem

860
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,440
because the the different scope entries

861
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,839
are really distinct and distinguishable

862
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,640
and all in all the group name or

863
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,920
uh the pattern a matters and you know

864
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,400
which type every scope entry is exactly

865
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,880
because of that bit so i i don't see any

866
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
source of confusion in trying to process

867
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,680
this

868
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,400
uh this collection of different types of

869
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
scope entries and it's only these two

870
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,880
types of course

871
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
but the advantage is that you can stick

872
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,440
to one access token only

873
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,760
so if there are no objections i think to

874
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,200
add this part too

875
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,240
and see where it goes

876
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,359
so basically as a user or

877
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,440
anything i'm going to do i'm going to

878
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,960
consider the union of the

879
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,480
no

880
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,280
as an admin what matters to you are the

881
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,079
the entries where the last bit of the

882
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,640
perm ends with one which classifies them

883
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,920
as admin entries and you can do what the

884
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,680
perm tells you

885
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,720
for the corresponding to id

886
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,599
entry or part of that scope entry

887
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,520
so you will have some permission for all

888
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,920
the groups whose name matches the

889
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,480
corresponding name pattern and the same

890
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,040
for another admin scope entry and so on

891
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,960
but then you may have together in the

892
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
same scope also some

893
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,040
member scope entries

894
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,280
and then things work just like in sk

895
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,560
group common score nothing needs to

896
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,200
define here

897
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,760
so what we need to define here is how

898
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,079
you make practically the two types of

899
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,920
scope entries coexist

900
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
and bottom line the trick is looking at

901
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,960
that this significant bit

902
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,560
and then you just polar their their

903
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,040
individual semantics

904
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
i see joran in the queue

905
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,839
yeah well

906
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,359
i was going to ask another question but

907
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,400
let me

908
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,480
start with this one

909
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,680
so

910
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,760
so this bit is only just

911
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,920
it's just like um

912
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,599
keeping tracks of track of things it

913
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,200
doesn't have any meaning it's not like

914
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,680
you get any other privileges or it's

915
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,240
just a way of displaying

916
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,040
when keeping keeping different the the

917
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,839
permissions for users in front

918
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,560
well

919
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,160
it has a meaning

920
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,240
we can use it to distinguish between the

921
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,800
two types of scope entries as a lucky uh

922
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,400
by-product

923
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,200
but otherwise it has a meaning in in the

924
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,400
green box

925
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,560
it's basically allowing uh the

926
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,720
administrator to perform

927
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,560
uh the actual

928
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,079
yes the thing is it's always set one

929
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,760
for every administrator for which this

930
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,440
scope entry is released

931
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,920
right you forgot about that okay so it

932
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,520
actually it's it's actually it's the

933
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,760
admin it's sort of similar signifying

934
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,920
the admin rights in some sense

935
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,920
yes uh for the blue case uh well if you

936
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
want to it also has a meaning but it was

937
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,240
defined as reserved and set to zero so

938
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,400
so it's non-meaning

939
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,000
but still they have a meaning first of

940
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,599
all it's just that we were lucky to

941
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,280
notice oh they can be used to

942
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,480
distinguish um which is which

943
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,599
yeah okay

944
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,040
uh i'll come back with the other

945
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,560
question

946
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,960
thank you

947
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,560
yeah uh this is just a summary of the

948
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,960
updates uh i've gone through and the

949
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,119
plan for the next revision is to address

950
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,760
those open points that i raise and come

951
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,319
with good text about them hopefully and

952
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,480
until then comments reviews are very

953
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,040
welcome from the

954
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,119
group maybe then i should take my

955
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,280
question

956
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,200
so um

957
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,440
um sorry something

958
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,280
um we have in in case

959
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,680
in ace group com

960
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,160
there is a section uh looking at

961
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,960
operations supported by clients

962
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,720
which expect what is expected by a

963
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,280
client dominion melee support

964
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,160
and to give a hint at sort of what

965
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,960
what what do you what is the bare

966
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,480
minimum that you need to implement

967
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,880
similar sorry

968
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,960
yes maybe something similar can be

969
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,359
thought here so in that document clients

970
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,960
were exactly group members only

971
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,400
this is intended for administrator

972
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,680
i expect an administrator to be able

973
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,800
very minimally to create a group i mean

974
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,280
very minimally

975
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,119
but makes sense to also expect

976
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,440
capability to update the configuration

977
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,599
and delete the group but we can start

978
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,440
thinking about presenting

979
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,599
uh yeah this capabilities under that

980
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,599
framework too

981
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,280
i think i mean it could be scary if you

982
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,720
open the document and you see all these

983
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,800
properties and it sort of uh adds up and

984
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
but if you get an understanding that

985
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,680
this is what you minimally need to

986
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,000
support and then i can build from that

987
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,160
that could be more inviting i think

988
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,599
i agree

989
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,800
minimally the group creation

990
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,079
yeah yeah

991
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,160
that sounds reasonable i didn't but i'm

992
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,079
on sort of basically expressed in terms

993
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:36,960
of

994
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,800
of which are the admin

995
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,839
operations and so on

996
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,359
yeah that was my comment thank you

997
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,680
thank you

998
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,400
okay i guess i am next in the queue so

999
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,760
to sort of

1000
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,880
synthesize daniel's comment from earlier

1001
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,920
and

1002
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,960
thinking about the use of aif

1003
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,440
so like we've got these group names

1004
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,720
and they

1005
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,400
sort of have to exist in a human

1006
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,160
readable form because the administrator

1007
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,640
is going to be using them and the

1008
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,240
administrator is often a human

1009
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,240
but we could certainly imagine an

1010
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,760
approach where

1011
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,880
the

1012
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,319
sort of underlying authoritative id

1013
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,040
is

1014
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,119
something else maybe a random number

1015
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,480
maybe some

1016
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,280
object with a segor structure

1017
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,680
and that the name is a attribute bound

1018
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,640
to it

1019
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,800
and when we go and we look at the

1020
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,200
authorization information we talk about

1021
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,359
this random id or other core structure

1022
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,319
and uh the name is only used for the

1023
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,800
readable bits and so it it turns out

1024
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,079
that aif

1025
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,640
only says the toid will often be a text

1026
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,720
string not that it has to be

1027
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,119
and so we perhaps think about whether

1028
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,599
there is a a useful

1029
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,480
sebor structure that's not a text string

1030
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,800
that would let us express the

1031
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,119
relationship between groups and sort of

1032
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,319
what we've been doing with the wild

1033
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,200
carding and the names for the permission

1034
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,839
coalescing

1035
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,240
but that would be in some sense more

1036
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,839
complicated of an approach than just

1037
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,839
using a text string because now we've

1038
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,760
got two different versions of the

1039
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,520
identifier that we have to keep track of

1040
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,760
we have to process

1041
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,920
and so it's convenient in some sense to

1042
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,560
use a text string for both and just

1043
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,720
put some underlying substructure in the

1044
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
text string

1045
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,240
um

1046
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,680
and you know if you have some time maybe

1047
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,440
think about whether there would be a

1048
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,040
nice elegant way of

1049
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,480
doing the group um

1050
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,000
the what we're currently doing with the

1051
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,359
wildcarding basically if there's an

1052
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,599
elegant way of doing that with a c or

1053
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,800
structure

1054
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,720
that's not a text string

1055
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,560
but i don't know that it's

1056
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,240
super critical to really

1057
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,599
look at it in that detail

1058
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,599
yeah i also think it's not too critical

1059
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,119
hopefully and for sure you'll get things

1060
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,359
more complicated but after some

1061
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,280
decomposing possibly

1062
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,040
i believe you need to end up to some

1063
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,000
kind of texturing anyway to to compare

1064
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,800
um yeah an exact name against the

1065
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,520
pattern in this particular case

1066
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,599
and thinking of other drafts where name

1067
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,440
were defined all along

1068
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,599
as the string as text strings already so

1069
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,280
group members are already thinking that

1070
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,400
way

1071
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,720
at an early discovery later on during

1072
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,440
joining us on so we're just keep

1073
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,400
building on the same tracks so to say

1074
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,359
and if we diverge uh assuming it it's

1075
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,960
convenient in some way

1076
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,359
it risks to to to have to

1077
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,200
open for rethinking

1078
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
uh previous steps too

1079
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,920
uh yeah unless we see any big gain

1080
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,319
probably simple text strings are just

1081
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,880
good enough

1082
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,359
we would need a pretty big gain to

1083
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,078
do something else

1084
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,118
okay thank you

1085
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,319
web slides

1086
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,119
yes i think that there's no

1087
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,599
totally different light set to be loaded

1088
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,359
because this was concluded

1089
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,920
so question do you think you're going to

1090
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,280
be ready um by next itf with the

1091
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,240
admin interface

1092
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,920
well there may be chances that it

1093
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,240
considered good enough to approach

1094
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,890
working group call uh

1095
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,440
[Music]

1096
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,839
i'm i'm not sure we can try it that

1097
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,839
depends how the documents evolved but

1098
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,720
ready at most means that

1099
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,560
because i mean

1100
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,920
we haven't even approached working or

1101
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,319
classical yet

1102
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,240
so you're not committing to be ready for

1103
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,640
next itf

1104
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,319
i i i i

1105
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,960
i plan to produce a revision

1106
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,319
incorporating all this uh okay in the in

1107
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,640
the best cases if you judge it ready for

1108
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,880
working group plus call that can happen

1109
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,920
uh

1110
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,559
but in case ready means ready for that

1111
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,200
not more really

1112
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,200
okay

1113
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,800
uh yeah i'm done with this presentation

1114
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,359
i i think there is one more on the

1115
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,160
revoked token notification

1116
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,160
document

1117
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,160
yes thank you which doesn't have to do

1118
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,839
with group communication uh finally uh

1119
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,400
but just to recap um this is an

1120
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,480
additional optional uh feature to

1121
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,359
support for for an authorization server

1122
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,160
to inform uh both client and resource

1123
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,440
servers about

1124
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,839
tokens that have been issued and they

1125
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,800
have been revoked but are not yet

1126
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,920
expired

1127
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,559
and it's intended to to complement not

1128
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,160
to replace at all uh the optional token

1129
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,400
introspection service but unlike

1130
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,800
introspection this is something truly

1131
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,359
available uh for both client and

1132
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,040
resource servers

1133
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,640
and the idea is for the authorization

1134
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,800
server to locally maintain

1135
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,760
a list of tokens that have been issued

1136
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,920
are revoked but are not inspired yet

1137
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,520
expired yet

1138
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,079
and both client and resource server can

1139
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,880
access that resource possibly observe it

1140
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,440
using observation for co-op

1141
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,760
and by doing so they can retrieve

1142
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,040
a list of revoked tokens but not really

1143
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,359
all of them only those pertaining to

1144
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,400
that exact client and resource server

1145
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,800
making the request

1146
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,559
so i just have a question

1147
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,520
um

1148
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,280
a token um also have a

1149
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,800
um a deadline or um

1150
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,079
it has a date

1151
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,720
after which it's not valid anymore or

1152
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,800
but that's expiration that that

1153
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,559
expiration date yeah

1154
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,200
yeah this is about uh tokens can be

1155
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,119
revoked before they come to that point

1156
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,119
for whatever reason

1157
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,599
and it's good to inform the interested

1158
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,160
parties as soon as possible

1159
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,200
yeah so basically in in but when you

1160
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,000
have a expiration date it's not part of

1161
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,960
the introspection

1162
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,520
so you have three mechanisms

1163
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,000
um

1164
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,720
try to introspect and expire token by

1165
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,480
reference of by value the authorization

1166
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,400
server will tell you this token is not

1167
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,040
valid and i think you can specify why

1168
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,760
and then okay you delete it

1169
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,960
um

1170
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,119
so sure you you can find out that the

1171
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,960
token is expired but but through

1172
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,800
introspection is a bit weird because you

1173
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,359
should know the token inspiration from

1174
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,680
what is defined in the token

1175
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,800
yeah exactly so this is one way

1176
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,319
i i see three ways to manage those

1177
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,040
um ask the revocation

1178
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,200
um i mean you look at the expiration

1179
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,480
time

1180
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,359
and you

1181
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,599
and you have the introspection

1182
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,240
where you you ask what is the status of

1183
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,119
that token or and so on

1184
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,160
well you you know when it expires

1185
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,200
yeah uh

1186
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,040
so introspection can be useful to learn

1187
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,800
in advance if the token has been revoked

1188
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
if you take the initiative to introspect

1189
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,720
of course that you can do one token at a

1190
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,959
time

1191
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,520
sorry sorry sorry to jump in i guess

1192
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,920
daniel i would treat the

1193
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,720
introspection and the expiration

1194
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,880
information in the token as being

1195
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,800
basically equivalent

1196
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,119
and so if there was a token that had an

1197
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,880
expiration time

1198
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,119
but it got revoked before then

1199
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,960
i would still expect that when i go and

1200
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,880
consult the token introspection it would

1201
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,079
just tell me

1202
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,760
the expiration time of the token it

1203
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,440
would not i would not expect

1204
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,880
introspection to

1205
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,720
uh have the additional information about

1206
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,079
revocation

1207
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,240
yeah

1208
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,480
okay

1209
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,319
thanks so yeah this was just a

1210
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,480
high-level recap to get into the topic

1211
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,000
again

1212
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,720
so

1213
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,520
next slide please

1214
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,760
uh yeah

1215
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,280
and to add on that there are different

1216
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,200
ways for clients and resource server to

1217
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,640
retrieve this

1218
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,319
information about revoked tokens from

1219
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,400
the authorization server we have right

1220
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,880
now defined three modes of operation one

1221
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,960
must be supported by the authorization

1222
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,280
server we called it full query

1223
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,520
and basically a device being it client

1224
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,040
or resource server doesn't really matter

1225
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,839
anymore um retrieves all the pertaining

1226
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,680
tokens that have been revoked

1227
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,240
in a diff query is not about retrieving

1228
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,359
um

1229
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,760
indications one by one of all the

1230
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,160
currently expired of revoked but not

1231
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,200
expired yet tokens but rather a list of

1232
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,559
recent updates uh performed to that set

1233
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,559
of uh revoked token

1234
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,960
and the third mode of operation built uh

1235
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,079
over uh suggestions from ben actually uh

1236
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,960
some meetings ago and and using the the

1237
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,880
cursor pattern of the series transfer

1238
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,880
pattern it's basically an extension of

1239
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,440
the second mode that additionally allows

1240
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,319
for uh transferring updates and chunks

1241
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,880
uh even starting from a particular

1242
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,280
indicated resumption point

1243
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,280
but details about these modes are in the

1244
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,280
draft anyway it was just a bit context

1245
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,800
again

1246
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,280
next slide please

1247
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,640
uh right this was uh recently adopted

1248
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,880
basically right after uh the previous

1249
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,240
itf meeting

1250
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,119
and we received a review

1251
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,720
on the list from marco azori from cnr uh

1252
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,559
we are very grateful and is also

1253
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,640
implementing this draft

1254
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,520
uh building on our implementation uh

1255
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,599
for for java california

1256
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,839
and we submitted a new version in fact

1257
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,160
addressing uh most of that review i

1258
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,000
think we still have an open point and

1259
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,920
adding more text

1260
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,640
about unspecified uh underspecified

1261
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,720
error handling and token processing

1262
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,839
other

1263
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,119
than some editorial improvements

1264
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,760
next slide please

1265
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,800
yeah i just wanted to mention the the

1266
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,880
main points from that review and the

1267
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,400
open point that i have left uh from it

1268
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,079
first of all we realized we weren't

1269
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,480
having explicit text about what the

1270
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,240
client and resource server would do when

1271
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,880
learning that some uh pertaining tokens

1272
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,839
are

1273
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,680
are revoked so so now we are pretty

1274
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,960
explicit about having to to expunge them

1275
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,960
and the resource server is to take some

1276
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,520
additional action of course

1277
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,079
uh the result server may learn that an

1278
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,680
access token it has uh has been revoked

1279
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,079
so it should delete it and stop any

1280
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,000
attempt of access

1281
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,160
but it should also remember

1282
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,319
that that particular access token has

1283
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,359
been revoked until it expires

1284
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,440
and that's necessary in order to prevent

1285
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,280
the client in in bed or good faith or or

1286
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,319
following a delayed behavior to post or

1287
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,040
repost that token that is not expired

1288
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,520
but um has been revoked

1289
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,599
so there's some particular carrying all

1290
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,599
this that the resource server has to

1291
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,520
take care of uh

1292
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,599
other than the simple fact of deleting

1293
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,599
the token altogether uh of course

1294
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,640
this is now in the draft

1295
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,440
next slide please

1296
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,440
uh yeah then there was a lot of

1297
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,400
improvement to do in terms of uh error

1298
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,280
handling uh not only about

1299
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,319
which uh situations result in an error

1300
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:15,440
to be handled and communicated to the

1301
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,200
uh requesting device

1302
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,359
but we also introduce an actual format

1303
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,400
for error response messages with mix

1304
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,760
again uh the semantics used in in the

1305
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,680
ace framework first of all and then in

1306
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,160
some of the application profiles

1307
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,960
so in case of error uh the the response

1308
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,359
returned uh to the requesting client the

1309
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,520
resource server uses the same content

1310
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,000
format we had defined any way in

1311
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
previous version of the draft

1312
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,240
there has to be an an integer

1313
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,160
identifying the error

1314
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,400
and optionally a text string giving an

1315
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,559
error description and we have come up

1316
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,720
with a number of error cases that we are

1317
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,720
already using and and we are re

1318
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,520
registering those

1319
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,319
uh next slide please

1320
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,880
we should be about uh yeah uh the the

1321
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,119
open point we have so uh i presented

1322
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,920
before the the use of the cursor pattern

1323
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,839
as a third mode of operation and it is

1324
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,760
still presented that way

1325
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,319
in appendix b since well it was

1326
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,960
introduced that way and the more we

1327
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,880
thought about that the more we realized

1328
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,079
that well it's actually an extension of

1329
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,960
the second mode because it it is still

1330
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,160
diff based

1331
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,240
just ending the additional functionality

1332
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,359
of

1333
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,760
resuming the update transfer from a

1334
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,119
certain point

1335
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,440
um in time

1336
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,440
so the plan will be to to move this

1337
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,799
content

1338
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,799
out of appendix b and to merge it in the

1339
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,119
document body in the section where the

1340
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,799
second mode

1341
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,640
is defined

1342
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,240
and there's christian in the queue

1343
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,720
hello

1344
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,200
could you explain whether there is much

1345
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,319
value to the section 2 to the second

1346
00:56:58,319 --> 00:56:59,839
mechanism

1347
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,720
um in in having it stand alone without

1348
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,119
the extensions of the third mechanism

1349
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:05,920
so

1350
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,000
might it not be easier to just go all

1351
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,520
the way and describe the third mechanism

1352
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,119
and

1353
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,119
or is is there a particular use case

1354
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,200
where the second mechanism without the

1355
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,640
extensions is really valuable

1356
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,480
thanks uh if you are sure that the

1357
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,799
authorization server supports the cursor

1358
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,720
pattern it just goes for it anyway

1359
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,839
and then it works well uh in case the

1360
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,839
client resource ever supports it or or

1361
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:34,799
not

1362
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,799
so it's mostly to try to be friendly

1363
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,319
with an authorization server that

1364
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,079
doesn't want to use it but for the sake

1365
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,359
of presentation

1366
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:45,119
yeah it's a single thing

1367
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,640
totally so i hope i can capture this

1368
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,839
well enough

1369
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,280
in the revision that was basically the

1370
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,280
intention

1371
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,000
okay uh

1372
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,559
thanks uh next slide uh

1373
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,880
is a detail that that uh follows from

1374
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,440
this how to represent a payload of

1375
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,880
responses

1376
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,480
and this is the current situation

1377
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,640
considering the way we have three

1378
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,079
distinct modes

1379
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,319
uh error responses are always hyper map

1380
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,680
fine

1381
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,760
the first and second mode are very

1382
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,520
minimal that was good enough that

1383
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,520
they've always been just a cyber array

1384
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,040
in the payload

1385
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,760
this currently third mode with the

1386
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,880
cursor uses a sieber map instead

1387
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,599
so thinking of the changes we want to do

1388
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,440
and moving the appendix b content to the

1389
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,359
document body

1390
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,839
next slide

1391
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:39,040
please it seems like uh you may want to

1392
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,240
have sibo maps uh somewhere sometimes

1393
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,720
not this also came from the review we

1394
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,280
got from marco that was just proposing

1395
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,040
okay just use cyber maps and that's it

1396
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,119
in every response because probably

1397
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,440
you're going to to need a cbr map anyway

1398
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,880
so just use it

1399
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,480
in any possible response from any

1400
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,760
possible mode so they would work

1401
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,760
it's kind of a shortcut

1402
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,440
i also discussed more offline with mark

1403
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,760
about that and there can be a middle

1404
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,000
ground which is more optimal which is

1405
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,839
the proposal of the next

1406
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,240
slide

1407
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,960
you have two minutes yes i can make it

1408
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,200
so error responses are and can stay

1409
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,000
silver maps uh that's fine

1410
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,640
we can define the the format for the

1411
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,200
payload of responses basically depending

1412
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,839
on what the authorization server

1413
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:34,480
supports so if it supports the the use

1414
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,720
of cursor basically well then all

1415
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,040
responses would be a silver map worst

1416
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,880
case they will include the cursor

1417
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,720
information that a client resource

1418
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,480
server may not understand but they've

1419
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,400
just ignored that information and it

1420
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,480
doesn't hurt but if we have an

1421
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,000
authorization server that doesn't

1422
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,160
support cursor and would never use that

1423
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,000
then we are sure there will never be any

1424
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,400
use of seaboard maps for successful

1425
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,440
responses and we can fall back

1426
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,119
zebra arrays

1427
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,359
personally i don't see this that

1428
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,599
complicated if it's phrased well in the

1429
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:08,160
document so as a first attempt i i'll

1430
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,880
try to to propose this text and then

1431
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,400
it's probably easier to judge for the

1432
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,799
group once it is written down

1433
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,799
but at least it prevents useless

1434
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,640
overhead unless you really need it

1435
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,400
because the authorization server goes

1436
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,799
for that

1437
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,480
this will probably go through a few

1438
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,640
iterations of course before we are all

1439
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,880
happy enough but

1440
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,559
i take a first attempt

1441
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,880
okay good and that's it

1442
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,359
so thank you for presenting um

1443
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,400
and uh i think we can conclude um

1444
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,280
uh this meeting but before i'd like to

1445
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,280
to ask um

1446
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,400
maybe

1447
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,160
last time if ben is willing to say

1448
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,359
something or

1449
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,920
um if paul

1450
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,079
our new lady is willing to

1451
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,960
to say anything

1452
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,640
so paul speaking no not yet because well

1453
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,400
i'm not yet an ad and i definitely have

1454
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,920
to read up on everything that's

1455
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,400
happening in this group um ben has been

1456
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,160
great at giving me a handoff on a lot of

1457
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,760
things but i have a lot of reading to

1458
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,040
catch up on

1459
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,280
but i'll reach out to you as chairs too

1460
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,359
once i'm ready for you

1461
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,400
okay sure thank you

1462
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,880
so i think we're done

1463
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,520
thank you very much

1464
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,520
oh

1465
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,280
which of course i have to when is the

1466
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,480
next formal telecap

1467
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,799
right so

1468
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:16,000
but i have a lot of reading to do there

1469
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,559
but yeah

1470
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,559
yeah i might have to uh might have to do

1471
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,599
you know objections there

1472
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,459
[Music]

1473
