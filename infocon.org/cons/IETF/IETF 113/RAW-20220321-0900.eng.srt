1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,120
now i have the control yes

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,960
and what happens when we're done with

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,040
this

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
how do we pass do you pass control back

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,880
or does it always stay with us

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,279
as well

7
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,279
say again pascal

8
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,200
as a chair you can

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,960
the control that you gave you just take

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,239
it back

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,480
so there's i'm at the chair right now so

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
i can't see the button

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,680
i mean you can say back

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,920
i've seen the time

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
let's let's uh let's

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,199
start so um

17
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,520
let's find the chair slides

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,200
excellent

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,080
um so good morning everybody um it is

morning local time

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,680
this is raw reliable and available

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
wireless uh so we are

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,759
doing a full hybrid experiment here by

24
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,560
having the chairs both remote and uh

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
karina and carlos standing in being our

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
in-room delegates so thank you very much

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
to both of them for trying it

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,759
um

29
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,040
i think we have more chairs and

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
delegates that we have attendees in

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,560
person but um

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
celebi uh hopefully this will change

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,240
over time so can i eve can i have the

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,520
next slide please or can i just take

35

control

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,439
i think you can just take control

37
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,520
but let me

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,040

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,640
meeting like any other working group

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,239
meeting um

62
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,000
operates under the ietf note well

63
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,120
and here are the exact um

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,480
bcps which cover the the fine details so

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,359
there's a record here

66
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,560
so ietf113 this is a hybrid meeting

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,200
which is exciting uh i can see a lot of

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
people are participating remotely but if

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,840
you are on site and i do have a view of

70
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,800
who's in the room uh there is an on-site

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
tool so that we can integrate the

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,640
meeting queue with uh the remote queue

73
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,239
um

74
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,519
and we'll see how well that goes i mean

75
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,040
meet echo i think has turned into a

76
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,200
really elegant tool over the last couple

77
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,120
of years so i'm confident that this will

78
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
work well

79
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
um key things is in-session participants

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
please keep your audio and video

81
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,799
off if not using the on-site version

82
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
not 100 sure what that means but that i

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,640
assume is to reduce echo from the room

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,400
as you can tell we're in quite a large

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
echoey room in vienna

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,879
but it's not destroying the audio too

87
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,080
much for me

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,319
i apologize if anyone else is having

89
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,119
terrible feedback

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,120
uh right administrative yeah so uh yep

91
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,799
this is obviously on meat echo i'm

92
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,560
assuming everyone is on meat echo

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,720
although i suppose you could be

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,360
connecting via jabba um but there is the

95
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,000
url for the meat echo uh automatic blue

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
sheets so the days of pen and paper have

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
passed um

98
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,000
or are there blue sheets in the room

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
carlos and karina

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,840
no

101
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,960
um so

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,120
we seem to have lost kodi md but we now

103
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,600
have hedge dock built into um

104
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
the meet echo ui

105
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,520
so we would like to do collaborative

106
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
notes if there is someone who is willing

107
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,840
to act as an interactive

108
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,080
note taker that would be great but

109
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
please

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
everybody join in to

111
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,560
make sure

112
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,600
a any um

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,560
spellings of names are correct because

114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
there are a combination of different

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,919
languages and different names so please

116
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,759
make sure that that whoever is taking

117
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,120
notes has got your name right that's

118
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,039
very handy and also double check that

119
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,479
the point you were trying to make was

120
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,960
captured correctly so

121
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,800
anything you can do

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,520
in that way would be great

123
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,199

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,599
we do have a bit of

174
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,000
additional time so we're we don't have

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,919
to stay entirely within our limits

176
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,319
because of course discussion is

177
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,520
the

178
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,560
main point of having these meetings so

179
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,639
we welcome your questions comments

180
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,360
and inputs

181
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,160
all right

182
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,400
thanks steve uh if he is available uh

183
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,919
should we go straight on fell back or

184
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,000
does anyone wish to pass the agenda just

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,919
very quickly checking the

186
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,159
queue

187
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,479
no pretty

188
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,160
if you're available or

189
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
excellent

190
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
uh

191
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
i believe we're going to be the magic of

192
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,199
if you do request to share slides oh

193
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,560
we're trying to make this slide thing

194
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
work

195
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,919
so pass slide control

196
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,599
so i'm talking to myself now while i try

197
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,120
and click buttons which is a little

198
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,240
unprofessional

199
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,039
um

200
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
so niels you should have control of

201
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
slides

202
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,560
all right

203
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
which means you should be able to share

204
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,319
pre-loaded slides

205
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,719
or i cannot

206
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,759
hold on i can't there we go

207
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,880
all right then i cancel my request and

208
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
you can share the slides that watched as

209
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,320
well

210
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,479
and if i pass slide control you should

211
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,560
be able to change forwards and back

212
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,160
does that make sense

213
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,760
it's getting there this meets echo it's

214
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,120
pretty good these days so anyway thank

215
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,080
you me checker um

216
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
all right good morning everyone i'll be

217
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,920
relatively brief today uh but i want to

218
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
talk a little bit about the changes that

219
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,760
we did from the last version 09 to the

220
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,279
version 10 now

221
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,000
uh thanks to john scott we really

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
received some great feedback that we

223
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,000
incorporated in the draft and i think

224
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
the draft is just um

225
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,519
and the pros have been uploaded the

226
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,880
version 10.

227
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,120
so let me just walk you over the changes

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
um it's a note well

229
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,760
and here are the changes so from the

230
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
version 09 to the version 10 uh the

231
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,040
outline basically remained the same we

232
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,680
did some changes in chapter three with

233
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,240
the motivation use cases

234
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,120
then

235
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,959
we adapted some

236
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,600
lines in the requirements section

237
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
and i think the the biggest change

238
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,600
happened in the reference section since

239
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,240
we removed a lot from the normative or

240
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
basically everything from the normative

241
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,320
to informative references

242
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,200
um since with a little back and forth

243
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,240
with john

244
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
we received the feedback that the draft

245
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,120
in itself is completely understandable

246
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,519
without relying on any external

247
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
references and the rest is just

248
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,399
additional information for the reader to

249
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,279
really grasp the depth of the work here

250
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,519
additionally in the appendix we had some

251
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,399
changes made to enable the reader to

252
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,600
understand

253
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,839
the requirements imposed by aeronautical

254
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,079
referential documents

255
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,240
and i think with that i walked over all

256
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,560
the changes and now we go in the depth

257
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,200
of each of them

258
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,399
so

259
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,880
in the motivation use cases

260
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
um

261
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
we weren't clear enough about the

262
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,120
current security concept that is in

263
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
place so

264
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,360
um if we look at aeronautical

265
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
communications today

266
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
and we're talking about terrestrial

267
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,399
based long-range communications

268
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,959
um there's just one system in place

269
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,720
really that's currently rolled out it's

270
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
called the video number two that's the

271
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,959
vhf data link mode too

272
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,480
and uh

273
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,120
it was rolled out in the 90s about that

274
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,519
and there are really no cyber security

275
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
measures on the link in itself and so

276
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,640
the entire security concept relies on

277
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,079
phraseology

278
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,000
well-trained personnel

279
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
pilot and air traffic controller really

280
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,760
knowing each other

281
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,160
but there's no security measures as we

282
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,440
would define it here and essentially had

283
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,000
to clarify that and that is one of the

284
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,040
big differences between the current uh

285
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,519
version of aeronautical communications

286
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,120
and the one we're proposing here with

287
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,279
ldx

288
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,680
um the second one is about the

289
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,120
separation of uh safety

290
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,680
based communications and entertainment

291
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,600
or in-flight entertainment based

292
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,959
communications

293
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,680
and this can so so there's a scenario

294
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,440
that can happen for instance the flight

295
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,240
crew or the pilots they have a

296
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,399
limited data link available meaning they

297
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,760
have around

298
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,399
10 kilobits in in up and down stream

299
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,519
while a passenger can watch netflix in

300
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,000
plain basically but those are different

301
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,440
domains right so one domain is for

302
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,360
communicating safety critical stuff so

303
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,959
basically high reliability and

304
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,600
availability are key so the links are

305
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,160
designed with more robustness in mind

306
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,800
and on the other hand it's just about um

307
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
throughput and this is why

308
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,839
uh we have those two concepts and both

309
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,839
of them obviously must be strictly uh

310
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,320
separated and this

311
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
also happens with aldex as well

312
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,560
let me

313
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,120
all right so uh that covers chapter

314
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,000
three

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,120
in chapter six with the requirements

316
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,399
um we made clear again that there's a

317
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,480
huge change currently happening with

318
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,440
aeronautical communications so until now

319
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,600
most of the stuff was communicated by a

320
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,800
voice

321
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,880
and there's a protocol from the 70s

322
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,320
called a cars

323
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,279
then in the 90s there was the 80 in osi

324
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,959
and since the 2010 um the entire idea is

325
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:43,760
to

326
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,399
run traffic so aeronautical

327
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,839
telecommunications network traffic via

328
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,160
an id based network and it's also why

329
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,399
we're here with the ietf

330
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
and

331
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
the envisioned network so it's not

332
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,480
installed in place except for some

333
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,079
experimental

334
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,600
airports

335
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
uh is that you have an ipv6 based

336
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,399
network for aeronautical communications

337
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,120
but um

338
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
you want to have again separation of

339
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,680
consensus so if you want to have the

340
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,240
aeronautical ip internet so basically

341
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,560
for routing the atm traffic and

342
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,399
obviously you want to have the the

343
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,959
customer internet as separated as much

344
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,199
as possible so that you don't um you're

345
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,199
not able to switch from one to the other

346
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,600
and cause shenanigans

347
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,079
um the second part was about the rollout

348
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,560
so um i think everyone is aware that

349
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,600
with the

350
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,800
uh pandemic everything has um scheduled

351
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,120
a little later than uh was anticipated

352
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,279
so the entire ruler was initially

353
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,320
planned for 2024 and now we're on

354
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,320
2025-26

355
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,160
um

356
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,480
yeah last thing that we

357
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,680
changed again with the references

358
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,199
um

359
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,800
with with a little bit of back and forth

360
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,959
and discussions uh

361
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:03,680
we

362
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,240
basically adapted the document um to

363
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
such a state that if you read the entire

364
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,079
document that you'll be able to

365
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,519
understand what aldex is what it does

366
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,000
and you don't really need additional

367
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,639
information to grasp the concept if you

368
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,560
want to go deeper such as what kind of

369
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,880
modulation schemes are

370
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,120
done how does the file protocol look

371
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920
like then obviously we point to other

372
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,639
references but it's not necessary to

373
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,320
read them to fully understand the

374
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,639
concept of it

375
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,800
and i think that covers basically all

376
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
the changes obviously we changed knits

377
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,320
and bits here and there um some some

378
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,639
rewritten some sentences to make them

379
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,880
better understandable

380
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,000
and yeah um at this stage i just want to

381
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,040
thank uh john um for the really really

382
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
the feedback

383
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,600
and um yeah from there

384
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,480
it's just a road down to what comes next

385
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
thank you

386
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,759
um i jumped in the queue first there but

387
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,279
actually i wanted to ask a question

388
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,639
really of john and and niels is have we

389
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,360
addressed everything john wants to say

390
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,240
and

391
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,199
uh

392
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,800
addressed all john's comments and are we

393
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,639
ready to move forward so uh i'll shut up

394
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,240
and let john speak

395
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,639
uh yeah so i i went and looked at the

396
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,279
preprint um and it looked like

397
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,680
everything was well covered um

398
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,040
thank you very much

399
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,839
and

400
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,920
um and thanks for writing an easy to

401
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,000
read document by the way

402
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,440
i know that's not easy um

403
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
anyway yeah i think we're ready uh so

404
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,560
you know so sometime this week i will

405
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,680
hit the button to start the ietf last

406
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,639
call

407
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
and we'll be on our way

408
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,079
excellent thanks john so that's that's

409
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,519
good it looks like we might have our

410
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,600
first raw rfc and it might be ldx but uh

411
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,000
yeah fingers crossed

412
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,839
thank you very much niels so uh thank

413
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,520
you since then i have closed the agenda

414
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,039
so i can't tell you what's happening

415
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,400
next so next up we've got uh if the

416
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,480
oh karina you're in the queue go for it

417
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,760
um

418
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,640
just two questions

419
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,039
references in should we just delete the

420
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,440
section or put

421
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,640
nothing to apply here

422
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,840
oh that's a good question i'm not sure

423
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
if there's a convention

424
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,200
for that uh i'm

425
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,600
comfortable with you either removing the

426
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
normative references heading or leaving

427
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,120
it empty

428
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,160
either one is okay um the the rfc editor

429
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,880
will fix it to match whatever the

430
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
their preferred style is once it gets

431
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,160
into edit

432
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,840
um i guess my my instinct would be to

433
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
actually there's an argument either way

434
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,080
so um

435
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,520
my first instinct would be to go ahead

436
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
and leave it in sort of as a you know

437
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,160
this space intentionally left blank but

438
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,880
really do as you prefer

439
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,240
karina my my advice would be

440
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,320
the rfc editors are very good at what

441
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,120
they do in terms of editing so

442
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,600
leave the heading there say this section

443
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,440
intentionally left blank and they will

444
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,520
fix it and they will fix it with you

445
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,280
they're very good at it so don't worry

446
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,039
too much about that sort of thing as

447
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,120
long as the content is good they'll

448
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,200
they'll really help you with the rest

449
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
it was just a question because i still

450
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,640
need to upload the version 10 because it

451
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,080
was blocked yesterday there too

452
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,679
yeah it's that that strange thing with

453
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,520
our atf where you can't upload until the

454
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,760
meeting starts for one week very bizarre

455
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,799
but um when you can just

456
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,280
no big deal so john i will upload it

457
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,760
within the days it should be online

458
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,840
latest tomorrow

459
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,720
fantastic great thank you thank you

460
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,960
thanks guys

461
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,760
so

462
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,039
uh next up we have carlos with uh the

463
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
use cases draft and as carlos is in the

464
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,120
chair i'm just gonna get out of the way

465
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,240
and let him

466
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,360
to do the thing

467
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,480
i was trying to use the

468
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,960
tool to share but anyway i will go to

469
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,400
the old way

470
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,919
sorry about that

471
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,039
i was trying

472
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,039
to use the new feature

473
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,480
but maybe it's easier if i do

474
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,960
okay

475
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,559
one second and i'll be there

476
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,799
yeah that's great we can see that

477
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,520
okay so this is going to be

478
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,840
let me

479
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,880
a very quick update on the raw use cases

480
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,320
so this is the

481
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,159
outline just for for those that may not

482
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:10,880
be

483
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,640
familiar with the draft there are

484
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,120
several use cases described aeronautical

485
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,960
communications amusement parks wireless

486
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,840
for industrial applications probably on

487
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,919
video wireless gaming uav and b2b

488
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,559
platoonian control edge robotics control

489
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,400
and emergencies

490
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,919
and for each of the drafts we have

491
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,880
different

492
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
sections analyzing the motivation for

493
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,760
why we need the use case the need for

494
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,159
wireless for that particular use case

495
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,159
and kind of the requirements for for raw

496
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,960
this is basically the structure per use

497
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,720
case description specific challenges

498
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,600
need for wireless and requirements and

499
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,200
in the last itf iteration we also added

500
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,919
a

501
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,480
subsection for the non-latency critical

502
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,320
considerations because

503
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,240
raw is not only about latency maybe

504
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,760
about latency of course but it may be

505
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
also about resiliency

506
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,679
in some scenarios where the latency is

507
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,159
not that critical so we believed based

508
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,000
on some comments from pascal

509
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,200
that was a

510
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
that was a

511
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,320
important thing to cover in the draft

512
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
and we basically

513
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
adapted the structure to to highlight

514
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,520
that point as well

515
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,440
then since last atf cycle we got some

516
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,559
very nice and good reviews from pascal

517
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,679
and from korina we think authors that we

518
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,840
address all the comments

519
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,960
from the reviews in the current

520
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
iteration so again big thanks for for

521
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
the reviewers to to take the time to

522
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
provide the comments and to check

523
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,799
everything from

524
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,480
things to clarify

525
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,320
reference to ad and also needs and and

526
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,880
typos that we had to fix

527
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
so by doing that we also did some

528
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,520
editorial fixes and improvements along

529
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,960
the way

530
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,799
and in terms of next steps well now it's

531
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,000
um it was publication requested so it's

532
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
at the asc

533
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,919
and we're basically waiting for comments

534
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,240
at that at that stage and then we will

535
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,760
try our best to

536
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,600
to address the comments so not really

537
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,960
much to what at this point

538
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,400
any questions comments

539
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
i was just going to add a thank you for

540
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
getting the document to the state it's

541
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,000
in at the moment and thank you to the

542
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,120
reviewers

543
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,919
um i think obviously charney's is in the

544
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,760
depth of previewing ldx at the moment

545
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,000
and so this is next in his queue when he

546
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
has the cycles so

547
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,799
thank you very much

548
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,240
anyone else with comment

549
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,919
excellent um so next up we have uh

550
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,240
pascal who uh is speaking about the

551
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,919
architecture and the framework documents

552
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,679
and the split between the two and so

553
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,000
he's got quite a big time uh slot for

554
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,720
this basically it's pascal knows what

555
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,440
you're doing so um take the time to

556
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,360
split it up as you like

557
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,720
um

558
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,120
go ahead

559
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,120
okay i hope you can hear me i'm sharing

560
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,679
the uh architecture slides and if it

561
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,760
doesn't consume more space i can't send

562
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,520
the video out i guess

563
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,640
there we go

564
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,320
guys um yes so this is about the the raw

565
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,600
architecture document which was uh split

566
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
uh between architecture and framework

567
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
as we said

568
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
um so

569
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,720
i won't go back to this slide which is

570
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,960
basically uh summarizing what we expect

571
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,000
to do uh in very short it's it's a

572
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,360
matter of

573
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,600
uh balancing the use of energy and

574
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,919
spectrum uh the more energetic spectrum

575
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,760
you use the more reliability you get on

576
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,159
your transmissions but um on the other

577
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,799
hand uh you have constrained energy and

578
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,559
constrained bandwidth in the wireless

579
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,279
spectrum so you cannot push

580
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,919
too far on either energy bandwidth so we

581
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,120
have to find

582
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,840
uh engineered methods to to optimize

583
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,440
effectively the balance between how much

584
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,760
reliability and variability we get and

585
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
how much energy and bandwidth spectrum

586
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,880
basically we stand we spend getting that

587
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
reliability so that's that's a generic

588
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,240
concept for common context forum

589
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,440
now um the initial document had

590
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,520
two main pieces

591
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
uh which we kind of split into

592
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,919
architecture and framework one is is

593
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,320
forward-looking it's basically giving

594
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,039
the the broad building blocks and that

595
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,799
includes terminology because if you

596
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,400
don't have a crisp terminology you

597
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,640
cannot go anywhere because we don't even

598
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
understand each other so so we need we

599
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,240
need to have a very crisp energy in

600
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,880
which we can build and we we also need

601
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,039
to say hey here is there are the objects

602
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,640
we are manipulating

603
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,240
and and here is what we are trying to

604
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,200
achieve

605
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,440
but without giving

606
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,760
here is why you take that draft and we

607
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,000
are using that protocol because we don't

608
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,600
even know yet

609
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,520
so clearly we position ourselves as

610
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,760
spin-off or maybe hopefully one day you

611
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,039
spin in

612
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,320
of that net

613
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,200
uh

614
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
focusing on

615
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,200
wireless and reliability

616
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,159
but exactly which which drafts rfcs will

617
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,240
will be proposed and uh

618
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,880
to achieve role it's it's not the scope

619
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
of architecture architecturally says

620
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
there is a broad picture of what we

621
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,320
intend to achieve but so it's really

622
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,480
something that we want to publish early

623
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,679
in the

624
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,919
work of this group so so we can have a

625
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
terminology and can have goals that we

626
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,559
all understand the agreement

627
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,880
the framework on the other hand

628
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,559
is to be

629
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,679
our

630
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,919
journal if you like i mean following our

631
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,400
progress the more we focus on there is

632
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,480
the technology that we're going to use

633
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,159
uh this draft this rfcs

634
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,360
those will be

635
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,240
how we effectively build our solution

636
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
and so the other idea is that the

637
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,679
framework

638
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,720
is

639
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,600
to be read by people who bought the work

640
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,480
in between so they can see where we are

641
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,520
and it will be published at the very end

642
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,400
so as i say testimony of how we do that

643
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,279
i mean this that's basically how it

644
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,919
works it's using this rfc to you know

645
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,159
hopefully everything will be rfc by that

646
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,880
and there are all those rfc interact to

647
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,640
effectively achieve

648
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,799
uh what the architecture was talking

649
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,400
about

650
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,279
so

651
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,520
yeah we have we hope we are close to

652
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,679
workgroup let's call it the architecture

653
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,080
and effectively for the framework we

654
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,159
want to keep it alive until the very end

655
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,400
of the of the work

656
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,360
now

657
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
the um

658
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,039
the first thing we need to really agree

659
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,279
about as i said is the terminology and

660
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,400
and we realize uh trying to dig into

661
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,919
what we want to achieve

662
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,200
that there might be a gap and i just

663
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
reviewed an excellent review thank you

664
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,039
so much lou uh an email by lou that was

665
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,720
posted this morning on the mailing list

666
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,200
i mean at least alpha these commands are

667
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,760
really related to you know goal to

668
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,120
terminology and then the rest is

669
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,279
obviously the goal and the context but

670
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,200
the basically the terminology will be

671
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,080
very very critical to us on the one hand

672
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
we want to

673
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,600
to use you know as much common

674
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,840
terminology as the rest of the ietf so

675
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,600
we don't want to involve a different

676
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,760
term for something that exists which is

677
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,240
kind of a quantum and valuable track

678
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,039
um

679
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,480
on the other hand

680
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,320
when things don't match we want to be

681
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,559
able to differentiate and say hey

682
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
um really our understanding of this is

683
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,240
that

684
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,840
and in particular we we have this

685
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,240
problem with path i've been digging

686
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,520
uh the idf a lot of the term path and

687
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,720
that that really troubles me

688
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,159
most of the

689
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,840
path has been used by many many working

690
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
groups with ietf and iota

691
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
and

692
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,360
the term usually references

693
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,480
not

694
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,279
a a graph really but more like an

695
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,640
experience

696
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,360
like here is the path that this packet

697
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,520
has been following

698
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,880
and that

699
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,840
kind of

700
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,480
yields the notion that the packet has

701
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,000
kept is its integrity from a to b

702
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,120
and that does follow a serial sequence

703
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,840
of nodes and links

704
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,120
a to b to c to d whatever to destination

705
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,679
and we are not doing that

706
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,039
we we are computing a graph

707
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,080
which is a potential

708
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,919
and the path that the packet will follow

709
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,440
it's actually many of them because the

710
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
packet may be duplicated

711
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,520
and a packet we may not keep its

712
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,360
integrity if we took some network coding

713
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,559
and we flood

714
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,159
a small graph from a to b

715
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,039
with different network credit fragments

716
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,000
then

717
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,919
yeah the the packet will not even

718
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,399
experience one path it's pieces of the

719
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,559
packet or by-products of the packet

720
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,960
fragmentation and coding will follow

721
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,039
different paths

722
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,279
so so basically

723
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,840
we we we kind of want to keep the the

724
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,760
concept of path to express an experience

725
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,320
there is no everything that was used in

726
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,159
the process of getting that information

727
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,760
from a to

728
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,399
and we call that a complex path because

729
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,240
now it's not as simple as a cereal thing

730
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,799
it's not even the experience of a

731
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,720
packet

732
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,399
because it might have been broken in

733
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,520
pieces

734
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,240
so we we call that that experience a

735
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,880
complex path by you know an energy to a

736
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,840
path

737
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,279
but then then we still need a term

738
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,880
to express

739
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,960
the potential of a packet because what

740
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
we are doing really is we are building

741
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,120
this graph from a to b

742
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,159
and then we are using a subset of it

743
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,039
so so the big graph that that exists and

744
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,480
may or may not be

745
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,440
fully or partially

746
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,799
is is not an experience it's a potential

747
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,279
it's it's what you may use it's the

748
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,200
subset of the overall network that is

749
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
available to you at the ingress to to

750
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,840
effectively propagate that information

751
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,600
all the way to the destination so we

752
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,960
want to make a difference between that

753
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,080
potential and an actual experience

754
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,279
and that's why

755
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,559
we have this concept of track now uh

756
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,679
i just saw this morning the the

757
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,279
the feedback from lou

758
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,640
how is that different from from a uh

759
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,399
basically a tea

760
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,240
path a protection path for traffic

761
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,799
engineering uh

762
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
we need more discussion with lou and see

763
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,600
you know how the terms overlap and if if

764
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,960
track is completely uh within the

765
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,000
concept of of t-pass and protection path

766
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and honestly i don't know

767
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,600
um i've not dug into that and uh

768
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,159
contribution on that term and etc i mean

769
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,960
that would be great uh but for now we

770
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,120
have the definition uh that i have

771
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,760
copied here it's basically

772
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,919
defined as an ios3 abstraction basically

773
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,120
a graph

774
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,399
and that goes from a point a to point b

775
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,200
uh

776
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,960
with uh that net edges uh that net nodes

777
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,640
at the edges

778
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,159
and uh

779
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,360
serial path between the edges uh

780
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,200
operating as segments that join the

781
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,960
edges so the vertices are serial path

782
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,640
uh

783
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,679
uh operating at as i said that the dead

784
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,799
next player

785
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,279
could be actually at the four okay i i

786
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,440
need to check that term because uh for

787
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,360
me the vertices are stereo and they

788
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
could effectively operate at the

789
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,120
detonate forming subliminal so that

790
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,200
might be a typo

791
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,519
but the the

792
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,600
when you do any replication elimination

793
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,080
uh at the edges those those will be uh

794
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,760
relayed out so they will they will go

795
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,799
all the way to service okay

796
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,399
oh uh effectively that's that's what i'm

797
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,399
okay that i want confused with it's an

798
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,240
edge but yes so so actually the text is

799
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,440
correct so the notice vertices the

800
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,279
places where you can effectively fork

801
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,159
they are uh directly a detected surface

802
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,440
and then the the edges the hops it can

803
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,240
be a multi-hop that net transit path

804
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,320
in that case it's really serial

805
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,640
between the edges it's going to be a

806
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,679
serial uh set of nodes

807
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,760
so i'm sorry it's just like english

808
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,320
confusion between vertices and h i can't

809
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
choose to do those terms

810
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,720
um okay now

811
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,360
once we we've introduced what we uh mean

812
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,279
by the the concept of track which is

813
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,519
really that that potential graph and

814
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,399
that

815
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,240
based on layer three abstraction doesn't

816
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,559
really care about the layer

817
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,840
um

818
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,600
we need to differentiate another thing

819
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,640
which is

820
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,080
um

821
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,240
what is the piping you know what the

822
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,919
what the network

823
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,600
layer operates on

824
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,039
uh how to get from a to b etc from what

825
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,519
is being transported within this this

826
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,559
pipe

827
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,960
um initially for instance in that

828
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,519
network when we looked at ipv6 we did

829
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,240
not want to introduce too many headers

830
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,399
and stuff so we basically said

831
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,039
um we identified the flow which is an

832
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,840
application layer construct

833
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
with the five or six double depending on

834
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,200
v4 v6

835
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,640
uh that's basically source designation

836
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,000
address uh uh sort edition port uh

837
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,559
application and

838
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,440
upper layer and

839
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,559
protocol and if your v6

840
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,120
you can have those bits as well

841
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,439
anyway

842
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,919
using that basically means that we do

843
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,320
the network operation so we process the

844
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,559
water based on the color of the water or

845
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,799
whatever

846
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,840
but at the network layer it's

847
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,440
we can have a lot more power if we

848
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,200
effectively use our own network layer

849
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,320
uh

850
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,839
objects

851
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,000
that i call the pipes and android pipe

852
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
stuff and then we put the water on the

853
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,520
pipe at the ingress and it goes out of

854
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,399
the grass and this way you can put

855
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,399
multiple floors for instance inside

856
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,639
inside a single pipe then you can merge

857
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,280
multiple pipes um to a bigger pipe and

858
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,440
separate those flows uh when you reach

859
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,159
this nation etc so basically there is

860
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,800
this desire to separate the piping uh

861
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,239
which would be the track

862
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,639
from from the applications and the

863
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,280
network layer construct from from the

864
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,199
upper layer signaling which is reflected

865
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,918
by the factor

866
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,520
so how we do it exactly is is not really

867
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,480
said and that's going to be the

868
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
framework and that could be something

869
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
which really happens at that net but but

870
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,239
it's a goal for us to to be able to

871
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,920
transport multiple flows in the same

872
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,160
track and signal the front treatment at

873
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,480
the network layer as the track as

874
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
opposed to the flows themselves and keep

875
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,520
the flow

876
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,720
the application object separate from the

877
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
network object

878
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,880
so separating signaling we would work on

879
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,839
the float

880
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,400
oh alright i see uh you have your hands

881
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,680
wrapped

882
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,200
sorry i didn't mean to interrupt too

883
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,280
much pascal but

884
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,520
this is where crossover into debt net

885
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,119
applies now

886
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,000
so far i don't see that you've defined

887
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,839
anything that's particularly different

888
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,480
from the definitions in debt net

889
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,560
which does raise and i'm sort of hoping

890
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,400
lou is going to jump in and correct me

891
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,280
sorry i'm going to cough

892
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,800
sorry um i i i'm a little wary about

893
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
defining new

894
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,400
terms

895
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,480
that should be very similar to the terms

896
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,240
that already exist in internet i

897
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,440
understand we're going to build into

898
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,040
perio functions etc but

899
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,960
how how or why is this different it's

900
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,880
maybe my lack of understanding

901
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,240
that that would be the discussion on the

902
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,200
mailing list uh on on loose email

903
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,320
right

904
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,240
how much try can i see that who is

905
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,880
joining but uh this was just

906
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,400
this morning so we could not have a

907
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,880
thread on it but basically we we will

908
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,040
have this this uh track versus uh t

909
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,760
uh uh protection path discussion

910
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,560
and see if we can convert uh track into

911
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,079
t protection or if if if uh we want to

912
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,000
be more specific into exactly what works

913
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,200
about and then we'll give the voice to

914
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,680
please look

915
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,119
no

916
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,480
sorry

917
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,839
i guess i need more coffee um

918
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,440
rick i think you're

919
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,160
you're right on um the i agree with the

920
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
comment is uh that there's a lot here

921
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,599
that's similar and there's just some new

922
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,400
terminology that if we can align um

923
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,320
we'll be in good shape so largely what

924
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
pascal said i think another question is

925
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,000
um are we really limited just to ipv6

926
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,880
uh yeah yeah so yeah yeah for later but

927
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,839
yes

928
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,839
oh

929
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,880
rick brought it up so he asked for me to

930
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
comment so i commented uh i'll wait to

931
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,320
the end thanks

932
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,119
yeah i i i put up your email actually

933
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,720
luke and i wish at the end of this

934
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,440
presentation to go through it

935
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,960
have four items and i would like to to

936
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,040
make sure that they are all discussed uh

937
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,520
but yes and and the answer is certainly

938
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,359
not i mean i have personally i have no

939
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,359
idea that it's it's it's i understand

940
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,520
it's a mistake i i can wait

941
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,200
it's only because rick asked

942
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,000
okay okay so so let's move on

943
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,240
um yeah so the

944
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,480
basically the architecture focuses on on

945
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,760
one item

946
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,839
that joins to another point of look what

947
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,560
is raw basically uh

948
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,480
right now this architecture focuses on

949
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,520
just this udalu

950
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,680
is that all that relative on the

951
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,079
variable could mean certainly not

952
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,520
so

953
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,079
if we want to make the term raw generic

954
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,400
enough to really mean reliable and

955
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,720
available wireless probably we need to

956
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,800
to say that this architecture focuses on

957
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,200
one aspect of making a wireless relay

958
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,280
board available and that aspect this

959
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,440
particular architecture is really

960
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,320
focusing on the huda loop and then

961
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,880
probably to answer uh that other part of

962
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,720
of luke's review

963
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,359
what we are doing right now is probably

964
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,920
not you know the overarching

965
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,160
architecture of anything that could be

966
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,440
you know

967
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,680
that could make wireless uh really more

968
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,640
available but really uh

969
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,359
this this uda loop and the psc that we

970
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,960
are building to to uh complete the loop

971
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,400
so maybe we need to

972
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,359
to

973
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,520
or something uh when you say the raw

974
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,839
architecture we should basically say

975
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,839
this architecture or something

976
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,359
because it's not everything that you

977
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,440
could do for a labor wireless it's it's

978
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,079
very specifically handling this this

979
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,359
loop

980
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,520
so the determiner i mean i've put a link

981
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,320
here it's it's 40 or 50 years old it

982
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,800
probably started in the military if i

983
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,400
like the history of it

984
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,000
um

985
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,640
it's really this loop of you know

986
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,320
observing a fact and that's really where

987
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,160
the oem comes in

988
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,720
orienting is more like applying

989
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,000
intelligence

990
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,240
and you know the what you learned from

991
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,160
the past for instance

992
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,520
uh to to say oh based on that

993
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,359
observation there is

994
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,960
there is the sort of thing it should be

995
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,000
doing

996
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,160
and and in our case probably if we have

997
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,560
a pc and that's another question

998
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,000
if we have a pc computing uh the the

999
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,200
track

1000
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,160
um then the pc could also come with some

1001
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,640
recommendations on how to use it

1002
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,480
that would that would be what

1003
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
orientation would mean for us i think

1004
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,560
some some intelligence

1005
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,000
of uh how to to use the subset of the

1006
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,680
truck for a particular

1007
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,599
packet because of the particular

1008
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,920
condition of this time

1009
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,119
and the decision is is our plc engine uh

1010
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,440
basically

1011
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,800
making a decision based on the

1012
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,079
observation and the orientation you

1013
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,520
compile those two you match them and you

1014
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,920
say oh here is what they should be doing

1015
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,440
and and then the

1016
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,960
uh the action is the actual signaling uh

1017
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,560
how you copy the packets and multiple

1018
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,560
paths and how you signal that

1019
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,400
so that's that's pretty much the the

1020
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,480
focus of this document

1021
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,960
uh which is called raw architecture like

1022
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,760
you said but we need to to figure out

1023
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,520
uh

1024
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,119
inside the document how would you say

1025
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,480
the raw architecture what we need to do

1026
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,960
exactly and that's that smooth point

1027
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,200
so more under the loop i mean you've

1028
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,720
seen that number of times it's in the

1029
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,160
architecture

1030
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,800
but basically obviously with oem oreos

1031
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,359
based on you know pc metal information

1032
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,640
about the graph

1033
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
uh decide and that would be the psc

1034
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
decision and act and that's how we use

1035
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,960
the terpario which which extend the pre

1036
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,200
of data that net

1037
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,599
features

1038
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,440
um

1039
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,800
so

1040
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,640
robert says that not

1041
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,960
we have interesting use cases where

1042
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,839
actually some pieces of the path

1043
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,480
are not necessarily deterministic in

1044
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,359
terms of uh fully bounded latency for

1045
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,560
instance when you

1046
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,440
look at the access network and we focus

1047
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,720
on the first half which can be wireless

1048
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,640
5g wi-fi

1049
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,760
some things and multiple technologies

1050
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,280
we don't have control on the rest of the

1051
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,000
way and it might be very very different

1052
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,920
but at some point we need to to make a

1053
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,000
decision on depending on cards by not

1054
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,560
reliability and so far to provide

1055
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,960
for the service level objective uh

1056
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,839
associated to this back-end

1057
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,240
and that's still a raw decision

1058
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,200
so

1059
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,960
there is a little bit of uh non-overlap

1060
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
as long as that naturally requires that

1061
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,520
every every uh node underway is

1062
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,839
deterministic and that requirement comes

1063
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,359
from it comes with the body latency

1064
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,319
so reliable and variable does not

1065
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,640
necessarily mean bonding latencies many

1066
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,280
times it will but

1067
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,800
it's reliable means you have an

1068
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,720
objective and you need it if that

1069
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,280
objective uh that objective has

1070
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,520
bodybuilders you need to beat that if

1071
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,000
that objective has

1072
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,040
you know

1073
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
so much of nine so many notes in the row

1074
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,480
etc but you have enough buffer for the

1075
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,680
latency

1076
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,920
um that really you don't need to go into

1077
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,200
the gory uh aspects of of uh that net

1078
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,480
and tsn

1079
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,720
for instance you know the back end of

1080
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,640
wireless access

1081
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
can be considered relatable enough and

1082
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,279
low latency enough then then you're done

1083
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,560
okay so you know right basically uh

1084
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,040
splitting some functions of the pce

1085
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,720
because

1086
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,560
in our cases that would be translated

1087
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,640
pushing the reaction to the network and

1088
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,640
basically you can see the pc as the

1089
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,599
brain

1090
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,200
and then there will be loose discussion

1091
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,280
on whether there's always a pc and yes

1092
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,440
it's an architecture we need to to

1093
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,240
decide that is there always a pc or not

1094
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,960
probably not but we need to rely on that

1095
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,920
uh on this email and then the psc which

1096
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,560
really exports the the data plane

1097
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,960
short-term solutions uh

1098
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,160
selection from the pc

1099
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,079
and there is how the

1100
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,720
takes place so the architecture

1101
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
shows those confidence and

1102
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,760
places them and shows their relationship

1103
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,720
normally as i said it should not discuss

1104
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,560
effective protocols it should not say

1105
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,800
it's this protocol that protocol and for

1106
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,720
instance for iam it's a very

1107
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,520
vague term that's perfectly fit with

1108
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,760
what we want at this level the only

1109
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,760
exception and then a bit on this slide

1110
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,359
is the lip

1111
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,280
i don't know

1112
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,079
if

1113
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,760
it's fair because now we say oh it's

1114
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,359
still if it's now but

1115
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,280
there's no no real family but the leap

1116
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,680
itself is a family also

1117
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,240
so it seems to me that using dilip as

1118
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,000
the term

1119
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,240
is broad enough just like using oam is

1120
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,040
broad enough and we i mean if that if

1121
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,200
i'm wrong on that then please

1122
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,599
give me a term but then compasses ddp

1123
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,200
and its family but

1124
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,119
that's probably the only case where i

1125
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,359
effectively list

1126
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,640
in a

1127
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,400
specific

1128
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,520
protocol kind of

1129
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,400
so the status of the document

1130
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,560
so within the split uh right after itf

1131
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,359
on 12 since then we have two iterations

1132
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,280
uh one for

1133
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,359
fabric review so many many signs fabrics

1134
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,480
um

1135
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,839
so there were a number of

1136
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,440
um points which were transmitted

1137
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,480
reformulation clarification

1138
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,240
and then there was uh they've got a

1139
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,160
country uh review

1140
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,880
and uh

1141
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,599
yes there's more

1142
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,680
pretty special route of loose

1143
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,400
issues as well how do you position

1144
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,440
things versus statement

1145
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,520
my personal view is is we are kind of a

1146
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,720
spinning spin off of that net with an

1147
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,839
extension focused on one specific aspect

1148
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,680
and with the hope that

1149
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,800
at some point the work goes uh back into

1150
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,960
into that next but but we can have done

1151
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,319
this study

1152
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,440
uh and i hope it still fits um as we do

1153
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,640
it we we effectively need to to realize

1154
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,520
where we have some tension and that

1155
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,680
includes a path where uh

1156
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,920
you don't effectively have the net nodes

1157
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,680
all the way through

1158
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,000
that can be attention uh the definition

1159
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,440
of track

1160
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,680
uh we'll see if that

1161
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,839
we can fold that back in

1162
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,200
um

1163
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,240
but even if it if it stays as a terror

1164
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,520
maybe that can adapt it i don't know

1165
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,400
then then

1166
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,400
the the concept of truck is is already

1167
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,160
present in two other working groups i

1168
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,839
mean that six station and raw by the way

1169
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,480
to mean pretty much what we mean here

1170
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,440
um

1171
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,839
and

1172
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,000
then yes the scope and that's that's

1173
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,720
again a question uh so first by dave and

1174
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,920
then

1175
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,359
as well uh for instance lou asks about

1176
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,599
ipv6 and maybe that's when we can

1177
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,599
discuss that uh right now there is a

1178
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,440
sentence somewhere which which points at

1179
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,440
ipv6 extensions

1180
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,520
do we leave it to ipv6 or do we want to

1181
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,920
encompass more stuff

1182
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,440
and i have absolutely no idea that we we

1183
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,319
should limit to ipv6 it's just that i

1184
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,920
have no idea either

1185
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,960
and how we could do that outside of ipv6

1186
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,520
so so um

1187
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,480
i'm not happy to read the term ipv6 from

1188
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,960
from the sentence that lewis pointed out

1189
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,280
now i would be also happy to to find

1190
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,480
some to have some contribution

1191
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,920
explaining how we can do something else

1192
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,240
yes carlos

1193
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,359
so pascal one question um

1194
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,920
where do you see potential control

1195
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,040
playing

1196
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,079
extensions for for i mean for the pc the

1197
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,240
the pse

1198
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,240
doing all this learning and taking

1199
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,480
decisions do you foresee any control

1200
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,240
plane extensions

1201
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,240
need to be done in the future either

1202
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,400
indented or raw or how do you see that

1203
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,520
that part

1204
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,200
just to provide some

1205
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,800
background on why i'm making that

1206
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,480
question i'm working on some potential

1207
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,240
research projects that are looking into

1208
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,520
how to enable

1209
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,720
ai based decisions in a raw network

1210
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,280
in a multi-technology raw network

1211
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,359
and now we are trying to see

1212
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,839
where the control plane

1213
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,040
hooks to enable that application of ai

1214
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,280
based on monitoring an iem will will fit

1215
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,920
in the network

1216
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,000
okay so i see that trick and join with

1217
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,920
you i will give you my entire video

1218
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,359
request to add stuff so the way it's

1219
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,359
described right now

1220
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,079
the

1221
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,440
intelligence

1222
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,880
the learning the time series and

1223
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,000
everything

1224
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,200
would reside in the central controller

1225
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,640
and then we have to lose question is it

1226
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,480
always a central controller

1227
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,559
but the way it's written right now and

1228
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,880
happy to modify that but it says there

1229
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,640
is a central controller that does

1230
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,839
learning

1231
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,880
uh based on statistical information like

1232
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,200
long-term information etc so you can

1233
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,119
learn your time series you can so it's

1234
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,040
all statistics and ar is really

1235
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,640
statistics so that's why it's that it

1236
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,920
fits now this experience

1237
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,319
can be translated in new control plain

1238
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,480
element as you say as you're saying

1239
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,480
whereby the pce will feed the psc

1240
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,640
so the psc what sees a real-time event

1241
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,040
like this link is flapping can make

1242
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,280
instantly a decision based on all the

1243
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,119
experience that was digested by the pc

1244
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,040
so the pc would basically say in that

1245
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,040
case you do that that tells you the data

1246
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,160
you know

1247
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,839
transform the experience in something

1248
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,800
which is immediately actually

1249
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,160
by

1250
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,359
immediately actuated by the psc that's

1251
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,000
that's why what we mean by orient

1252
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,359
so the whole

1253
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,240
goal

1254
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,760
in role

1255
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,000
in the raw architecture is

1256
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,240
effectively uh doing this learning that

1257
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,520
you talk about

1258
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,839
beyond feeding that learning

1259
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,280
into the uh d which is the decision by

1260
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,880
the plc

1261
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,800
so yes you will need signaling there

1262
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,920
between pc and pse in the control plane

1263
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,880
now

1264
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,880
do you the second question is do you

1265
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,559
have the psc

1266
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,880
at the ingress only or do you distribute

1267
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,079
it

1268
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,800
in the different uh

1269
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,480
oh i just know that which is

1270
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,640
the

1271
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,400
and if you distribute it

1272
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,040
then you need some signaling

1273
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,319
in

1274
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,440
it would be a data principle for control

1275
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,079
whereby the intent of the ingress will

1276
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,319
be propagated to

1277
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,240
uh the that net relay so they can make

1278
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,559
appropriate action based on what the

1279
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,680
ingress intends to do

1280
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,000
with this we have rick on the line

1281
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,640
unless you want to

1282
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,480
doesn't seem to fit exactly your

1283
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,800
question

1284
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,079
keep going carlos

1285
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,359
i think i sort of agree with carlos on

1286
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,359
this and yes i know i have been

1287
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,720
promising you a review on this

1288
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,400
architecture document

1289
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,480
and i need to to get it done

1290
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,839
um

1291
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,440
it's the

1292
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,599
logical architecture i think is good in

1293
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,599
terms of the the

1294
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,760
explicit separation between the pce

1295
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,160
element and the pse element and lou and

1296
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,000
i have are having a small discussion

1297
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,680
about whether an exact pce

1298
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,920
implementation is required or not

1299
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,160
and my argument would be as a logical

1300
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,640
separation of responsibility it's a very

1301
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,280
good model but i think that needs to be

1302
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,839
extended down so there is an

1303
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,280
understanding of

1304
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,359
the psc communicates with some oam or

1305
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,119
linked date

1306
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,040
awareness protocol you know dlapp is an

1307
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,800
example of that and understanding that

1308
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
there is that southbound communication

1309
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,920
with the underlying layer two

1310
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,880
and

1311
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,200
there is a well there's northbound out

1312
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,599
of the layer two into the pse

1313
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,480
and there may well be some southbound

1314
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,960
communication from the pse back into the

1315
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,800
layer 2 to say

1316
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,720
i have understood

1317
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,760
how

1318
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,640
that and this is where the track um

1319
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,880
concept needs to be properly defined i

1320
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,920
understand the observed flows the the

1321
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,640
tracks of the data i understand the

1322
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,800
communication that the policy that is

1323
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,599
being set by the pce and therefore i

1324
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,480
need you layer two i'm i'm operating as

1325
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,079
the pse at the moment

1326
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,359
that diagram here to make this change in

1327
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,040
order to achieve the policy that is

1328
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,119
being determined and i think the content

1329
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,480
is all there i think it just needs a

1330
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,920
little bit of clarification in the

1331
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,160
document and i think we have to use the

1332
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,480
new um svg content because these

1333
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,839
diagrams are getting so complicated

1334
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,440
so

1335
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,319
my comment is is clarity i think we have

1336
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,319
all the information there but if and i

1337
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,400
think that might answer some of us

1338
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,960
questions as if we can say

1339
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,880
in the architecture this is covered in

1340
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,720
section three talking about that

1341
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,480
north-south interface

1342
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,880
between uh the p this pse stack section

1343
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,359
yeah so so basically we we probably can

1344
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,720
improve the

1345
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,760
uh pc to psc relationship with the

1346
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,720
orient and the capture of data and maybe

1347
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,400
the oaf flow flies directly from the the

1348
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,000
nodes to the pc or it's aggregated by

1349
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
the by the increase i don't know i mean

1350
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,079
we need to keep it yeah i would i i

1351
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,520
would i would recommend and i don't want

1352
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,720
to get too far into this because i

1353
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,720
should just do this as a proper review

1354
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,200
but i think we can separate the

1355
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,960
um

1356
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,400
the logical concepts of a pse talks to

1357
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,839
the layer below

1358
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,040
and commun you know there's a

1359
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,960
bi-directional communication there

1360
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,640
separate that from

1361
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,480
and here is some of the actual mechanics

1362
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,040
for doing that eg d-lep oam passive

1363
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,440
active blah blah blah and and sort of

1364
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,359
separating the detail from the the big

1365
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,520
concept because the i think in an

1366
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,200
architecture having that big concept is

1367
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,119
really good nothing to stop us drilling

1368
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,520
into more detail but if we separate that

1369
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,200
then i think it would be more obvious to

1370
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,480
people like carlos to say oh okay so if

1371
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,280
i'm doing ai guided prediction then i

1372
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,599
can influence my my outputs from my

1373
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,760
model is to influence this part of the

1374
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,520
architecture and it gives a bit of

1375
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,640
clarity

1376
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,200
yeah okay okay i i i need a proper

1377
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,160
no more questions sorry

1378
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,359
yeah so the psc seems to combine two

1379
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,799
separate functions

1380
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,359
one is the um

1381
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,119
sort of determination of which tracks

1382
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,319
are available

1383
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,480
and then the other is the selection on a

1384
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,960
per packet basis of which track is used

1385
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,200
or and that may be one or more

1386
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,640
and

1387
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,319
those are concepts that exist already in

1388
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,319
um sort of more general traffic

1389
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,359
engineering where uh instead of track if

1390
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,079
we call it a protection segment uh or

1391
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,160
protection path depending on

1392
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,559
the extent of it um

1393
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,760
that that happens at one time scale and

1394
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,799
then the

1395
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,200
uh the selection of which protection

1396
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,559
function is being used whether you're

1397
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,480
doing one for one one for n or one plus

1398
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,440
one or one plus n even um that is uh

1399
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,680
that's a different time scale and and

1400
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,760
happens at a different place

1401
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,240
really in the architecture and i think

1402
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,799
if we start shifting over to those sort

1403
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,280
of older terms we can leverage those

1404
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,119
concepts and that separation and that'll

1405
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,200
really help clarify

1406
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,359
the distinction of what you're thinking

1407
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,480
of belongs in a pce what belongs in the

1408
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,960
track identification part and what which

1409
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,599
belongs in the track uh selection part

1410
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,599
um and again you know those those sort

1411
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,880
of would be uh a loose path the the the

1412
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,440
protection segments and then the the

1413
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,400
actual protection uh switch function

1414
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,000
um so i i think there's some uh some

1415
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,599
terminology we can leverage that'll

1416
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,480
really help clean up uh the uh the

1417
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,640
concepts here and make it uh so we can

1418
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,640
delineate the different concepts and and

1419
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,000
clearly articulate the different

1420
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,799
functions that are um that are possible

1421
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,680
and and can be filled in in the raw

1422
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,359
future

1423
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,240
yes and you you have to be

1424
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,040
very very useful there because

1425
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,200
as you know i mean you have you have all

1426
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,839
the tea expertise that

1427
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,920
making sure but basically what we have

1428
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,440
now is the expression of what we want

1429
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,000
and now if it's if it fits within

1430
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,799
something then we can work that out

1431
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,280
and so just jumping in my with my chair

1432
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,760
hat on when this working group was

1433
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,240
formed we had a pretty solid steer from

1434
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,799
the iab that we shouldn't

1435
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,839
invent lots of new terminology

1436
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,440
unnecessarily so um i i think we've got

1437
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,280
to a good place actually where we have

1438
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,680
an an architecture which is it's a good

1439
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,799
draft

1440
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,200
but we can now look as lou said for

1441
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,720
alignment with

1442
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,880
net or tease or existing definitions of

1443
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,280
paths and tracks and i

1444
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,880
totally agree with you that there is a

1445
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,280
difference between the historical

1446
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,640
path that the package traversed and the

1447
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,799
future path you which pack you wish

1448
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,799
packets to follow they are two very

1449
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,319
different concepts and we need to make

1450
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,400
sure that terminology is accurate but if

1451
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,160
we can reuse

1452
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,920
something existing then we're going to

1453
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,640
be um much more

1454
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,440
on charter than if we uh totally

1455
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,599
reinvent new concepts so i'm all in

1456
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,599
favor of just doing that kind of gap

1457
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:44,960
analysis and making sure particularly

1458
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,880
with people like lou to advise to say

1459
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,640
actually this is the same concept to

1460
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,160
make sure we're aligned

1461
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,960
yeah and that was for me now be aware

1462
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,720
that the concept of trunk is already

1463
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,480
present in the other dtf we are not

1464
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,880
reforming that term no no no i'm not i'm

1465
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,480
not saying i i just making sure that

1466
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,319
we've got consistency we're not

1467
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,079
inventing a new track which is different

1468
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,319
from somebody else's track no no it is

1469
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,280
the exact same as 60-ish and

1470
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,720
raw actually

1471
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,599
so so we would have to look at that

1472
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:14,480
okay

1473
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,119
so i'm watching the clock tick down and

1474
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,319
uh i think i'm going to call that your

1475
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,400
time pascal if that's okay oh i just

1476
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,319
turned my video on there to politeness

1477
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,680
yeah so

1478
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,440
do we the the

1479
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,920
framework we will do it next time right

1480
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,000
yeah it does not change any weight split

1481
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,200
mostly split of the architecture

1482
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,559
so so

1483
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,880
just just to cover the framework um we

1484
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,920
are

1485
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,520
we held an interim meeting just to

1486
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,920
discuss these two documents it was uh it

1487
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,359
wasn't hugely well attended it was

1488
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:48,880
attended by carlos pascal even myself

1489
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,559
i think we we published some minutes of

1490
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,160
it we will continue to have these

1491
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,559
meetings um

1492
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,400
if particularly well where there is

1493
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,920
still discussion around the architecture

1494
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,240
document it would be great for those who

1495
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,160
have a strong opinion about it

1496
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,640
to get involved just to make progress

1497
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,839
because

1498
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,000
the intention of the working group

1499
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,760
really is

1500
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,319
as covered in the last ietf meeting

1501
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,559
the architecture document should be an

1502
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,240
early document that we push through the

1503
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,000
working group which contains

1504
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,280
informational

1505
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,559
uh information um describing how raw

1506
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,359
will

1507
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,119
the problem that raw will tackle and how

1508
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,359
it will tackle it whereas the framework

1509
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,480
is very much a living document which

1510
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,880
we don't intend to publish until pretty

1511
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,799
much the end of this charter cycle of

1512
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,280
the working group so we can almost use

1513
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,520
it as a peer-reviewed

1514
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,359
notepad of

1515
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:42,640
um

1516
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,000
how these

1517
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,839
how the architectural concepts are being

1518
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,520
implemented and how we're tying all

1519
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,680
these things together without forcing us

1520
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,480
to

1521
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,880
get it absolutely firm until this

1522
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,880
charter cycle of the working group is is

1523
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,880
complete which should be reasonably

1524
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,960
prompt because the iab

1525
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,480
do not like working groups running and

1526
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,160
running and running without a regular

1527
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,599
recharge

1528
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,240
uh lou you're in the queue go ahead

1529
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,520
yeah you mentioned that there was an

1530
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,599
interim on this document i didn't see an

1531
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,960
interim announced um

1532
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,359
uh it wasn't it wasn't an interim on

1533
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,920
this document it was a uh well no it

1534
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,839
wasn't it was an interim meeting it was

1535
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,359
held over ietf webex uh we announced it

1536
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:24,799
um i tried to look but it wasn't

1537
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,559
announced there's an ietf vendor meeting

1538
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,640
a formal no it was not announced as an

1539
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,960
interim meeting per se it was it was

1540
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,200
announced as the beginning of a series

1541
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,240
of

1542
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,720
regular meetings to discuss architecture

1543
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,680
and framework and i think the error was

1544
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,680
probably mine that i didn't give the

1545
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,640
subject line quite a crisp enough

1546
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,200
name to identify it as such and in the

1547
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,960
future we'll do that

1548
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,040
yeah that's actually where is going more

1549
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,599
than the past as the going forward is is

1550
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,000
uh an intro might a formal intro might

1551
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,359
be a really good idea since there are

1552
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,680
some big questions here um and maybe you

1553
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,040
use that to kick off these other

1554
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,680
meetings i i i did miss that meeting

1555
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,960
unintentionally um sorry about that uh

1556
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,720
and but i think an interim will will

1557
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,440
force more people's attention

1558
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,079
um and maybe get some wider attendance

1559
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,119
and then then maybe move on to uh

1560
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,319
uh

1561
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,799
less formal meetings so rick while you

1562
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,160
may have spoken there i think it's a

1563
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,680
great idea

1564
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,000
yeah i'm sorry again the miss speaking

1565
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,839
was was trying to work out the correct

1566
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,480
terminology between a a formal virtual

1567
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,799
interim meeting and a

1568
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,559
get open get together published on the

1569
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,040
mailing list about a document so yeah i

1570
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,040
i take your point about a formal interim

1571
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,559
i think that's

1572
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,400
probably a really good idea go on pascal

1573
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,599
um

1574
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,760
what would be very useful new uh short

1575
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,880
term is if you could point on where

1576
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,040
we could find the actual definitions of

1577
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,400
of the terms

1578
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,960
that overlap so we can read them

1579
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,640
carefully and analyze that

1580
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,440
that would that would be very good

1581
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,680
the terminology that you would suggest

1582
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,240
we reuse

1583
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,280
right um i am i am conscious that we are

1584
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,720
now actually we've got a little bit of

1585
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,000
time but uh if that's everything on

1586
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,119
these two documents

1587
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,319
yes great i mean the framework was more

1588
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:24,240
like through the other piece but we we

1589
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,680
introduced it and that's good enough for

1590
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,240
today i mean if you have a tight agenda

1591
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,160
uh we don't actually have a tight agenda

1592
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,839
so uh do you want to take five minutes

1593
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,200
on the framework document they're quite

1594
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,039
happy

1595
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,799
uh okay

1596
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,680
let me share that

1597
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:41,599
i need to

1598
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,319
oh i have to approve

1599
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:49,099
[Music]

1600
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,000
so

1601
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,039
yeah

1602
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,200
as we said we we split between the

1603
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,880
architecture which are the building

1604
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,240
blocks of

1605
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,559
here's what we want to achieve and the

1606
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,680
framework

1607
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,119
which is

1608
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,359
the future post-mortem

1609
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,720
and as of now it's the journal the live

1610
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,000
journal of

1611
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
what we think we are doing and how we

1612
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,839
think we're doing it

1613
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:15,039
and um the sort of thing that we want

1614
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:16,559
and we need

1615
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,599
is

1616
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,480
um

1617
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,520
explaining

1618
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,920
which use case we're serving and that's

1619
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,839
that's when for instance uh that was one

1620
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,760
of the questions by uh

1621
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,400
dave is doing do you serve the use case

1622
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,520
of the one-hot access

1623
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,359
network and just the first stop is

1624
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,359
wireless and then the rest of the way it

1625
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,640
could be your 5g core or could be

1626
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,799
through your enterprise network

1627
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,760
and android back somewhere where the

1628
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,000
photos are

1629
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,760
the applications are eliminated or

1630
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,280
something like that

1631
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,240
so

1632
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,440
um

1633
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,599
how do we signal

1634
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,319
the

1635
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,000
the the tracks

1636
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,839
for now their tracks

1637
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,359
are you using

1638
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,680
a source rod

1639
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,599
by the ingress which will basically tag

1640
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,799
the packets for that behavior or

1641
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,839
would we

1642
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:16,559
support a distributed plc and i guess

1643
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,559
the same will apply to the pc it wants

1644
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,359
to the pcb to answer those questions i

1645
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,039
mean how do we

1646
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,000
implement the pce is it really a

1647
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,240
centralized box is it a distributed

1648
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,920
function in the network

1649
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,559
uh how do we signal the orientation

1650
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:33,920
that's

1651
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,960
the question by carlos so how does the

1652
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,799
orient piece

1653
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,640
operate

1654
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,480
so all the protocols and and the

1655
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,240
protocol elements which which will be

1656
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,319
added to support opens we need to

1657
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,240
basically point at them

1658
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,319
very as we elaborate and if we change

1659
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,480
our minds as we work on then we need to

1660
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,640
update this document as well so it's

1661
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,359
really the expectation is it's the live

1662
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,000
pointer on the things we use and we

1663
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,680
think we're going to use

1664
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,359
and when we're done and we think we have

1665
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,280
a workable solution then we basically

1666
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,480
close the shop

1667
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,640
and this document publishes us here is

1668
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,200
how it works

1669
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,640
next slide please

1670
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,118
oh it's me

1671
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,480
please yes so that's why it's again it's

1672
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,559
it's it's the dave

1673
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:23,119
so i obeyed myself as you can see uh

1674
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,000
that that's the um

1675
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,280
assignment

1676
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,359
this is the just one use case we have

1677
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,119
many multi multiple use cases we have

1678
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,920
mesh we have but but here yes this is

1679
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,480
especially there to illustrate the fact

1680
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,960
that we cover uh the wireless access

1681
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,240
where only

1682
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,720
uh the only monitored network is the

1683
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,559
first half the radio access network it

1684
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,359
can be wi-fi 5g whatever and the

1685
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:50,079
internet is is best effort hopefully

1686
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,760
good enough uh if it's your your

1687
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,000
copyright or factory network uh

1688
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,200
hopefully it's good enough and low

1689
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,520
latency but

1690
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,359
not there can be that that other can be

1691
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:02,400
no that's not into it

1692
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,119
so

1693
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:06,160
that that's

1694
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,319
basically the same drawing as before but

1695
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,319
now we'll be talking about how this gets

1696
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,799
implemented so basically which protocols

1697
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:16,960
go into all of those little triangles

1698
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,920
part of what we will have to to document

1699
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,480
is how effectively we signal

1700
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,160
the flows and that's basically the

1701
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,520
architecture so we don't have to do

1702
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,200
anything about that so the flows we know

1703
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,680
that that framework is very clear

1704
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,319
but how we signal the path on which we

1705
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,839
place that flow

1706
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,680
how we extract

1707
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,359
how we split that

1708
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:40,480
um the track into the actual experience

1709
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,799
of the packet or the package fragments

1710
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,480
which is what we call the subtract so

1711
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,760
it's tracks within tracks

1712
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,400
that go end-to-end between a ingress and

1713
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,880
egress so how we signal all that in the

1714
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,079
packets

1715
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,920
we will have to point on the documents

1716
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,640
which do that

1717
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,200
um so

1718
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,880
that is the road map that we decided

1719
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,039
long long ago so we have to select

1720
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,520
appropriate radios and and effective use

1721
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,520
cases and with the progress we've done

1722
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,760
the index document and the others are

1723
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,720
coming

1724
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,359
uh and the use case that uh carlos just

1725
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,000
presented which is uh already pushed for

1726
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,039
uh ietf score uh we're in very good

1727
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,160
shape so i can i can say we we

1728
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,559
checked uh this thing

1729
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:27,599
now

1730
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,240
next is is to

1731
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,599
to uh basically decide how we signal

1732
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,839
the the the tracks and how we do the

1733
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,440
adaptation

1734
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,480
and

1735
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,280
then we have to talk about the iom

1736
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,039
there now depending on what the group

1737
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,200
wants to work on we probably want to

1738
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,799
have and that was called canon's

1739
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,359
question again we probably want to have

1740
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,359
a new item here which is about the

1741
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,960
orient for me the orient was autoscope

1742
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,000
mostly i mean it's the pc to pse

1743
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
uh control play

1744
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,480
skeleton and how really

1745
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,280
um that piece of the loop happens

1746
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,400
uh

1747
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,640
is not part of the framework well it has

1748
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,640
not been documented it doesn't have its

1749
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,559
peace in the framework but if the group

1750
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,240
wants to to include that in the

1751
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,799
discussion then yes we need to have a

1752
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,439
framework section on on the orient piece

1753
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,399
so basically which data how it fixed to

1754
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,120
the controller and how the controller

1755
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,679
fits its its orientation back into the

1756
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,198
psc

1757
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,560
so it's not sufficiently

1758
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,640
expressed in the framework as it stands

1759
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,040
and then again uh since we we are we

1760
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,880
expect to use a lot of work which which

1761
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,560
is being done elsewhere

1762
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,640
um we had this list forever i see that

1763
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,238
peace is not probably enough mentioned

1764
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,040
uh though it was at the

1765
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,920
their very initial

1766
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,839
meetings so probably we need to add

1767
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,960
these in that list

1768
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,520
any question

1769
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,759
i didn't speak about authorship but

1770
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:08,399
pretty much um it was the first slide

1771
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,880
with for now it's it's slow and i

1772
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,080
uh

1773
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,920
and then it was just me when i did the

1774
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,520
split i

1775
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,679
was expected to work on the architecture

1776
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,000
so the authorship of this and of the

1777
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,839
architecture are subject to change

1778
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,158
obviously

1779
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,640
go ahead yeah and not me as co-author is

1780
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,839
aspirational not reflective of reality

1781
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,839
but maybe future realities what is it

1782
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:32,839
the

1783
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:35,359
future yes it was the intention right i

1784
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,520
mean so so to give you access to the

1785
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,600
documents that allow you to basically

1786
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,319
publish or what uh your mistake

1787
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,120
and yeah i appreciate it i i i think

1788
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:45,920
let's

1789
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,600
get the architecture straightened and

1790
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,040
then we'll come back to the framework

1791
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,000
thank you

1792
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,759
yeah yeah this one is you know to be

1793
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,120
published two years from now three or

1794
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,679
four i don't know

1795
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,760
okay and that's pretty much it for me

1796
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,400
do we have questions

1797
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,560
thanks pascal uh i don't think we have

1798
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,239
any questions i have one point i didn't

1799
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,320
bother to jump to the queue because uh

1800
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,760
we kind of jumped to the end i think

1801
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,320
talking about the pse oh my god my dog

1802
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,679
is molting everywhere the the psep

1803
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,199
ce communication control plane um to me

1804
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,199
that smacks of netconf

1805
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,000
i mean that seems such a a a standard

1806
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
network management uh control plane

1807
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,719
given the the speed of speed of

1808
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,040
communication et cetera it's

1809
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,159
i i quite happy

1810
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,760
could be that

1811
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,480
now

1812
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,000
at some point we need to point on the

1813
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,040
solution

1814
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,280
so either we say it does not exist yet

1815
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,199
to do it proprietary which is pretty

1816
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,360
much what we have right now you do your

1817
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,400
own proprietary young models and what or

1818
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,000
representing the communication in both

1819
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,120
directions

1820
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,320
or we kind of decide that we want to

1821
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,040
provide some hints and then i mean

1822
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,760
that's just not done right now

1823
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,640
i i see that as stretching the scope of

1824
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,719
the working group to worry about that

1825
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,960
communication i think we can describe in

1826
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,040
the architecture the nature of that

1827
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,239
information so that's the the policy

1828
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,080
that is arriving and we can talk in

1829
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,960
terms of of track etc but how that

1830
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,120
information is carried i don't think

1831
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,960
it's in scope for the working group at

1832
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,000
the moment to start developing

1833
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,239
proprietary protein well not

1834
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,400
customized protocols to carry that

1835
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,520
information

1836
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,679
yes if somebody is excited in writing a

1837
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:35,760
yang model that sketches out how that

1838
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,360
information is carried then that

1839
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,679
obviously says you know you can use

1840
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,080
netconf to discuss that that young model

1841
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,040
it that could be if we feel that we have

1842
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,960
to define that that would be an obvious

1843
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,800
next step but i don't think we should

1844
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,320
burn too many cycles on that at the

1845
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,280
moment

1846
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,960
yeah that's pretty much where we are so

1847
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,960
we haven't seen it

1848
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,360
okay so moving on um

1849
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,000
next we have fabrice talking about uh om

1850
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,400
support i have

1851
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,400
i will click the magic

1852
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,600
grant preloaded slides oh

1853
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,199
sure to be able to have that and i will

1854
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,199
give you permission to control your

1855
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,600
slides

1856
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,840
uh no i've given that to eve i've given

1857
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,199
that to the wrong person because your

1858
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,280
name moved around there we go february

1859
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,320
so you should be able to steer those

1860
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,880
using the overlay at the bottom perfect

1861
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,199
right thank you very much uh you've got

1862
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,679
15 minutes which i hope is sufficient

1863
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,840
yeah largely sufficient i will just

1864
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,840
present the

1865
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,719
update so

1866
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,280
here just to have a remainder about the

1867
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,920
chronology of draft initially we had

1868
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,239
everything together in the oim draft and

1869
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,320
it was split in something which is

1870
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,560
related to date net in general so all

1871
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,440
the generic aspects of weim has been

1872
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,719
moved

1873
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:55,199
and we focus in this novel argument only

1874
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:58,320
on the om specs which are very specific

1875
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,920
to all

1876
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,159
so thanks to chevy for his proofreading

1877
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,600
last year

1878
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,080
we have made a few modifications

1879
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,640
i will present now

1880
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,120
so first of all we introduced another

1881
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,679
section about the recommendation we are

1882
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,360
listing in this section

1883
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,480
uh so typically we are listing the num

1884
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,199
the

1885
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:22,960
specific metrics that needs to be uh

1886
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,679
supported by the om nodes so typically

1887
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,840
we focus up to no on the packet there

1888
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,400
was show adventuring latency and the

1889
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,640
maximum consecutive failures that must

1890
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,440
be exposed by all the nodes

1891
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,440
we also say the fact that we have poor

1892
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,800
functions that must be currently order

1893
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,239
sorry

1894
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,280
and

1895
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,000
we need to also have some methods to

1896
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,239
aggregate the statistics to compress

1897
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:51,280
everything in the um later

1898
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,480
and we must also which will support word

1899
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,559
tracing with hybrid way

1900
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,120
in this novel uh draft

1901
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,159
uh we we are specifically the the

1902
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,040
piggybacking uh problem specifically so

1903
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,400
piggybacking that's inserting some

1904
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,320
additional information in existing

1905
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,480
packets so we we typically had some

1906
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,640
industrial control readers uh in

1907
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,360
wireless it may be also interesting to

1908
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,360
put the packets back to back

1909
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,960
in the same test slot because in

1910
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,560
wireless networks and particularly for

1911
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,480
schedule networks we have a cost for a

1912
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,719
medium access and the time slot is fixed

1913
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,960
so we will waste the bond wave so the

1914
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,960
interest of this kind of schedule

1915
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,600
networks is to put the uh impacts of the

1916
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,280
om information

1917
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,480
in the space of the temple time slot

1918
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,640
which is not used so

1919
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,880
that's the image of having control

1920
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,280
information for free so for free which

1921
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,040
means only that we have some bandwidth

1922
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,520
which is wasted however we we are

1923
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,000
keeping on having some large

1924
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,520
energy consumption because the

1925
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,960
transmitter and the receiver are

1926
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,920
obviously awake for a longer time so

1927
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,400
yeah we just reduced the cost of any

1928
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,000
medium access with this piggybacking

1929
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,520
technique

1930
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,360
and just to

1931
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,400
be clear about that we clearly classify

1932
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,960
the different way so active passive and

1933
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,440
hybrid active we are sending some probes

1934
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,040
with test packets

1935
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,440
with passive we just use database

1936
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,159
information and with hybrid om we have a

1937
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,800
mix so typically we may use some counter

1938
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,400
values or you may piggyback some

1939
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,840
information

1940
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,840
and we would just like to insist on the

1941
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,800
fact that

1942
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,520
piggybacking and ym techniques are

1943
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,880
probably orthogonal in the sense fans

1944
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,280
that's a negative or impacted that's a

1945
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,400
probe

1946
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,120
maybe trustee transmitted heroin so we

1947
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,880
should have in that case

1948
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,640
we must have in that case dedicated

1949
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,000
resources or we may encueve the prop so

1950
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
that it can be piggybacked with another

1951
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
data point when we have enough space in

1952
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,880
at a given time slots so so we are

1953
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,800
we are kind of stealing the the

1954
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,000
resources uh that are used for the data

1955
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,040
the data flows so basically that's just

1956
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,719
to be clear about this classification

1957
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,239
between oem and piggybacking

1958
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,960
so the draft is now stable

1959
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,520
your comments obviously and suggestions

1960
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,840
are worried welcome so please go ahead

1961
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,080
and have critics comments and

1962
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,600
suggestions

1963
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,000
and thank you and if someone has a

1964
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,520
question

1965
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,400
please wise you want

1966
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:41,839
any comments any questions

1967
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:48,678
pretend to step away for a moment

1968
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,120
thank you very much for the

1969
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,000
update and also for the ongoing work on

1970
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,679
the draft

1971
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,719
um it's great to hear uh

1972
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,840
the specifics

1973
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:09,040
okay good thank you

1974
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,520
to be continued on the mailing list

1975
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,360
um

1976
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:17,120
okay i think we are going to move now to

1977
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,159
um the last presentation which is the

1978
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,560
multi-domain extensions presentation

1979
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,560
carlos back to you

1980
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,159
would you like me to

1981
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,159
grab the slides or do you want to bring

1982
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,760
them up

1983
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,120
please serve the slice and pass me the

1984
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,239
control and then i will okay

1985
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,719
okay perfect

1986
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,000
thanks so

1987
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,159
this is a a new draft

1988
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,239
that is on multi-domain extensions and

1989
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,239
the purpose of this document is at this

1990
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,480
stage is mainly to

1991
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,640
present a problem that is not currently

1992
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,600
under

1993
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,600
the scope of the working group as far as

1994
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,120
we understand

1995
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,800
but to see whether this potential

1996
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,480
problem may be of interest and then to

1997
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,239
identify gaps

1998
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:22,159
and things that we may need to consider

1999
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:26,920
for this problem to be to be addressed

2000
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,239
so

2001
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,920
as i mentioned the current scope of the

2002
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,920
working group is although i don't think

2003
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,239
explicitly mentioned but my underlying

2004
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,480
assumption is focus on on single domain

2005
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,400
single administrative domain although

2006
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,760
that

2007
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,440
may translate also to technological

2008
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,600
domains if we make a like a one-to-one

2009
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,679
mapping technology

2010
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,520
to administrative domain or even if we

2011
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,199
don't there may be a scenario where

2012
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:50,719
multiple technological domains may

2013
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,840
involve this kind of

2014
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,080
multi-domain gaps

2015
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,320
so there are scenarios that we believe

2016
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,040
and we try to identify some in the draft

2017
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,280
where we may need to have multi-domain

2018
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,080
raw for example we may have hosts

2019
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,640
connected to different broad domains

2020
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,080
that they need to communicate to each

2021
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,360
other one host to another host

2022
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,080
traversing two different domains

2023
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,159
and one example is maybe large factories

2024
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,000
where may have uh

2025
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,840
the different networks organizing

2026
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,760
domains because of scalability and this

2027
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,840
kind of things and there may be

2028
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,000
particular situations in which we still

2029
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,360
need to connect

2030
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,840
one node in one domain to another node

2031
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,520
in another domain

2032
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,480
and we want that connection to

2033
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,120
be provided with some reliability

2034
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,120
availability

2035
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,719
warranties

2036
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:42,400
so the goal of the document is to

2037
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,520
explore

2038
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,440
this what are the potential gaps in the

2039
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,880
architecture

2040
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,120
in specific technologies that may be oem

2041
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,920
traversing multiple domains and try to

2042
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,480
start proposing some initial

2043
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,400
solution but just to to foster the

2044
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,960
discussion

2045
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,840
so this is one example

2046
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,400
using the ascii art that is in the draft

2047
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,639
that is not very simple to to show but

2048
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:09,120
we have two domains one at the top and

2049
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,480
one at the bottom

2050
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,480
we assume that each domain has an

2051
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,080
associated pce

2052
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,480
for the path computation

2053
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,000
and then we have different row notes we

2054
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,480
are assuming the distributed pse model

2055
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,280
where

2056
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,159
each node may be potentially a plc an

2057
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,360
english node

2058
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,120
then we have another domain at the

2059
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,679
bottom with another pce and different

2060
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:30,719
nodes

2061
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:31,600
and we

2062
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,520
have these two domains interconnected

2063
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,360
somehow

2064
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,159
in the document we don't go into how

2065
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,800
these domains are interconnected and how

2066
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,639
the different entities that as we will

2067
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,480
see in a assembly flow chart are aware

2068
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,560
of those interconnections there may be

2069
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,400
solutions different solutions for doing

2070
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,120
that so we start from the assumption we

2071
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,600
know or some nodes in the network know

2072
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,280
how these two domains are interconnected

2073
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,280
but they are still operating

2074
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,360
separately and we are trying to provide

2075
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,480
some

2076
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,280
solutions to enable host one for example

2077
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,719
in raw domain one

2078
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,040
to interconnect or to have a flow

2079
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,120
with host two in the second domain with

2080
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,840
some

2081
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,800
raw warranties

2082
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,719
so we have some discussion in the

2083
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,280
document again this is just to foster

2084
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,960
the discussion in the working group and

2085
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,280
to see whether this there is an interest

2086
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,600
but the the first idea that we thought

2087
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,960
it could be a way of enabling this

2088
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,320
is that we have the english node in the

2089
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,239
first domain where we get the request we

2090
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,600
want to have a communication between

2091
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,320
host one and host two

2092
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:41,199
and the ingress the pse in that domain

2093
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:44,000
will request to the pc in that domain i

2094
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,120
want to have

2095
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,239
this

2096
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,040
communication between this node and

2097
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,400
the nodes

2098
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,080
that are in the in the second that are

2099
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,560
connecting to the

2100
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,800
the english notes in the second domain

2101
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,159
okay

2102
01:21:58,159 --> 01:21:59,199
and that

2103
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,320
the pce will pc1 will know

2104
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,159
that there is a connection with the

2105
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:05,760
second domain and will request to the

2106
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,760
second pc

2107
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,000
the paths from those nodes to the

2108
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,719
destination node in the second domain

2109
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,080
the pc2

2110
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,400
will provide somehow we don't go into

2111
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,920
the details

2112
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,840
the tracks for that interconnection in

2113
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,159
the second domain and also the link some

2114
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:24,320
metrics about the link quality in those

2115
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,320
in those parts

2116
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,639
and with that the pce one will provide

2117
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:31,760
to the the ingress pc pse in the first

2118
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,600
domain about the tracks on each domain

2119
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,760
the different pscs involved in the other

2120
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,400
domain in the second domain and

2121
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,360
some kind of a split of sla that needs

2122
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,800
to be one and t on each of the domains

2123
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,000
because then

2124
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,840
we foresee but this again one initial

2125
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,600
discussion that its domain will keep

2126
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,639
track of

2127
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,719
monitoring and ensuring that the slash

2128
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,480
on each of the different tracks a domain

2129
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,800
sorry will be maintained somehow with

2130
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,320
lim mechanisms that may need to be

2131
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,560
cooperating somehow

2132
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,800
so in step number five

2133
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,920
the english pc pse in the first domain

2134
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,080
will communicate with the psc's in the

2135
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,400
english pss in the other domain

2136
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,560
to basically communicate

2137
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,639
the tracks that are involved and to

2138
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:22,639
enable those psis to have some uh

2139
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:24,400
to start doing these

2140
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,199
domain specific oein mechanisms at each

2141
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:28,639
of the domains

2142
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:30,800
and at this point each of the involved

2143
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,600
pscs will be able to compute the the

2144
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,400
paths

2145
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,760
or the at the the pse runtime

2146
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,679
and the oem mechanisms will be in place

2147
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,679
so as you can see this is a kind of high

2148
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:42,800
level

2149
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,880
initial discussion point

2150
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,360
but just to trigger some some or some to

2151
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,800
foster some potential discussion on

2152
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,320
whether this is something that is of

2153
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,920
interest for the for the working group

2154
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,120
or not

2155
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,520
so the point is not that much into the

2156
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,000
solution but more into the problem

2157
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,600
and the potential gaps that we may need

2158
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,560
to

2159
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,960
to address so just as the final slides

2160
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,800
is there any interest in this in this

2161
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,560
problem in the working group now it's

2162
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,080
not in the charter but maybe in the

2163
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,679
future

2164
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,440
there may be many gaps that we need to

2165
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,120
identify and address

2166
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,600
for example related to the aim

2167
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,239
there may be new protocol work needed in

2168
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:23,440
case raw recharges to do new protocol at

2169
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,440
some point in time of course if not

2170
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,440
that would not be the the case

2171
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,639
and of course there are some potential

2172
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,480
relations with deadnet

2173
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,239
because at the end of the day that they

2174
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,080
may be also interested in looking into

2175
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,639
multi-domain issues

2176
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,719
and that's it from my side just

2177
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,239
wanted to collect some feedback either

2178
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:41,199
now or

2179
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:42,880
maybe even better on the mainly list

2180
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,120
where we can have a sustained

2181
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,400
discussion

2182
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,280
so questions comments

2183
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,679
hi carlos uh it's rick

2184
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:52,639
um

2185
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,800
i'll turn my video on

2186
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,719
i thank you very much for this work this

2187
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,880
is this is i think is it really

2188
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,760
important uh so i i really have have a

2189
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,159
question and a statement so lou has put

2190
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,239
a a link in the chat

2191
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:07,440
to a

2192
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,360
generic multi-domain problem statement

2193
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,360
which is coming from

2194
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,679
the tease working group yes it is so i i

2195
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:17,199
recommend people to have a look at that

2196
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:18,400
for reference

2197
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,000
the other question is

2198
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,960
the architecture as presented by pascal

2199
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,159
just earlier um as as it is written has

2200
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:29,760
a single pce communicating with uh

2201
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,199
one or more pses

2202
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,360
does the working group think we ought to

2203
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,560
include the multi-domain use case within

2204
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,480
the architecture or leave the

2205
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,080
architecture as single domain and

2206
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,159
take on this work as as a sort of

2207
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:49,040
addendum to that architecture

2208
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,320
this is a very open question

2209
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,840
may i comment just briefly

2210
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,920
um i

2211
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,280
whenever we have talked about um raw and

2212
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,000
whenever we have made reference to the

2213
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,239
debt net agenda

2214
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:10,320
um and charter there is the specific

2215
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,320
wording in the charter uh about

2216
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,760
coordinated domains

2217
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,880
and although it hasn't been a

2218
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,040
topic of discussion it is

2219
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,920
uh described that way

2220
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,320
in the debt net charter so

2221
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,320
and maybe that's a good segue over to

2222
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,559
lou

2223
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,880
i was just going to say that the

2224
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,719
architecture i think already allows for

2225
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,000
it

2226
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
where in particular the text that talks

2227
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,600
about going over

2228
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,560
uh non-raw aware which i would translate

2229
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,880
to non-debt net aware

2230
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,639
uh domains

2231
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:50,719
it basically turns you into a

2232
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,840
multi-domain problem

2233
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,520
so i think we're all in agreement

2234
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,840
that it is uh although it hasn't been i

2235
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,840
wasn't stating an opinion on whether

2236
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,840
it's a good thing or a bad thing i was

2237
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,920
just saying that it's already in there

2238
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,719
it's being alluded to okay yes

2239
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,159
yes if not focused on it it

2240
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:17,120
the problem description um

2241
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,520
uh already references

2242
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,639
it both directions

2243
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,840
so i expressed my question with chair

2244
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,560
hat on is is carlos are you uh are you

2245
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,239
requesting working group adoption for

2246
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,400
this or do you want to

2247
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,000
get some review comments and burn a few

2248
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,080
cycles on it first and then

2249
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,520
what's your feeling

2250
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,800
at this point i wanted to have some

2251
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,040
feedback uh not really thinking of

2252
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,280
adoption or anything that that may come

2253
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,199
later if there is interest so that was

2254
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,520
my own my own purpose was to foster

2255
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,520
discussion on this point

2256
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,960
and of course if there is interest yes

2257
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,880
at this point in time and we of course

2258
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,800
are open to get more people joining the

2259
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,639
draft

2260
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,000
the more the better i mean the more

2261
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,400
people interested the better so yeah no

2262
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,880
no no question at this point i think

2263
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,719
this is the first time we discussed this

2264
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,000
so i think it's best to have more

2265
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,080
discussion before

2266
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,960
okay thank you

2267
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,960
eve you still have your oh no you don't

2268
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,280
you're just in the in the chair section

2269
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,400
so uh are there any more questions on

2270
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,280
this topic

2271
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:25,120
no

2272
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,159
okay

2273
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:28,880
so uh we actually have half an hour of

2274
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,719
the session left

2275
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,520
um so really this is this is an open mic

2276
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:37,760
opportunity um if anyone wishes to

2277
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,840
raise anything that they think might be

2278
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,120
of interest to the group in general

2279
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,960
stand up and tell us that we are going

2280
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,560
in completely the wrong direction and we

2281
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,320
ought to be looking at whatever some

2282
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,840
other working group is currently working

2283
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:53,199
on in classic ietf style or if there's

2284
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:55,280
something we have missed in

2285
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,920
what we've presented or documented so

2286
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,760
far

2287
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,280
or stand up and promote something

2288
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,719
exciting that's happening in another

2289
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,159
working group that we ought to be aware

2290
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:04,880
of

2291
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,800
this would be a really good moment

2292
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,960
well people consider that one thing i

2293
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,440
will add so

2294
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,440
i think this came out

2295
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,960
in one of the earlier presentations i

2296
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,520
think from pascal talking about

2297
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,719
um

2298
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:23,360
radio specific properties to be

2299
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,520
discussed

2300
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,080
as part of the

2301
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,800
link awareness or the oam feedback

2302
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,920
between

2303
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,840
the link layer and the pse component

2304
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,679
i know there are uh at least one

2305
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,560
extension to delap being proposed in the

2306
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,239
man a working group which i believe is

2307
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:47,199
meeting in the next session this morning

2308
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:49,840
uh to do with specific things such as

2309
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,760
channel assignment uh frequency

2310
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,600
bandwidth uh some really very uh

2311
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,400
radio link layer specific properties

2312
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,239
that could be um

2313
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,440
announced via a dlap protocol session

2314
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,760
if anyone is interested in further

2315
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,400
direction that the d-lab is going in

2316
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,400
that's in many

2317
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,440
otherwise anyone else

2318
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,600
if there is nothing else

2319
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,360
may i suggest that those of you who have

2320
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,080
booked out the two hours today for raw

2321
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,360
take this opportunity to go away and uh

2322
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,800
do the some of these reviews that you

2323
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,040
have promised i know i shall be

2324
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,960
um because

2325
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,239
the ietf

2326
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,639
revolves around good quality review

2327
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,480
and i know the authors of the various

2328
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,320
drafts in this working group deserve

2329
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,239
good quality review because they they

2330
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:45,199
have put

2331
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:48,159
a lot of effort into these documents

2332
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:50,880
eve do you want to add anything

2333
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,040
no i don't thank you for leaving the

2334
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:56,239
charge particularly given the hour

2335
01:30:56,239 --> 01:31:00,080
well i'm in europe so it's easy for me

2336
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,880
and i also want to um thank both karina

2337
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,480
and carlos for

2338
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:08,000
um their very much appreciated help

that's great and for those of you in the

2340
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:11,520

i am very jealous of those of you sat in

2343
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,920
the room um i wish i had been able to

2344
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,960
meet you in person this time around uh

2345
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,639
as a rough intention from the chairs we

2346
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:27,880
intend to be in person uh in at the

2347
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,400
atf-114 which would be very nice to meet

2348
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,080
you all again and speak to you again

2349
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,159
after two and a half years of of

2350
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:35,440
isolation

2351
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,239
but we've never met in person by the way

2352
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:40,000
no even i have never met in person we

2353
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,360
have we have chaired this working group

2354
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,880
for two and a half years without meeting

2355
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,880
in person so that's an all credit to to

2356
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,560
the internet but it would actually be

2357
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,719
quite nice to meet um

2358
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,080
on that note

2359
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,800
if there is nothing else i think we

2360
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,000
should probably close this meeting early

2361
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,320
any objection

2362
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,239
there we go

2363
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:02,960
and

2364
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,880
we are giving everybody half an hour to

2365
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,800
go away and quietly read some raw

2366
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,800
documents and add comment to the mailing

2367
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,920
list

2368
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,080
uh no objection from our a.d which is

2369
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,440
always good so um in which case thank

2370
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,840
you all very much uh extra thank you

2371
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,000
from me as well to carina and carlos for

2372
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,480
for being our chair delegates in the

2373
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,719
room luckily we didn't have a mad rush

2374
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:27,280
to the mic and everyone behaved and meet

2375
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,520
echo did us proud so

2376
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,800
thank you very much i'm going to call

2377
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:35,360
this a stop and um speak to you all

2378
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,760
on the list and in person and we will

2379
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,000
probably if we arrange a virtual interim

2380
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,080
we will publicize it in advance and

2381
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,320
properly on the mailing list so

2382
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,159
please keep an eye open for that for a

2383
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:48,480
bit more of a deep dive into

2384
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,120
architecture and possibly a little bit

2385
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,920
of multi-domain maybe i don't know right

2386
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,080
and even if we don't uh schedule an

2387
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,239
interim we may

2388
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:01,040
we'll do a better job this next time of

2389
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,199
creating a subject line that announces

2390
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,360
um a regular

2391
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,600
regularly held series of meetings to

2392
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,679
discuss those documents

2393
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:11,600
yeah indeed

2394
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,920
okay uh thanks all uh in which case i

2395
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,679
think we should probably

2396
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:18,480
close the meeting

2397
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,159

2398
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:22,639
don't know how to do it it's the very

2399
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:25,920
right most icon in meat echo at the top

2400
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,080

session determines

2419
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,760

two and a half years to be one of the

key researchers here

2440
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,239
because i'm involved in the big security

2441
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,400
project concordia where they are

2442

partners

2443
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,000
and then they just asked me with my

2444
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,280
expertise of iit security
