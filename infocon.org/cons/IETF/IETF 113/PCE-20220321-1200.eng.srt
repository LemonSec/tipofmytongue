23
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,120
working session

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,120
first one of the two that you can see

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,879

26
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,210

27
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,440
[Music]

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,319
so as usual you know the the best

29
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,920
practices when

30
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,319
we are

31
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,360
remote attending remotely using metacore

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,760
we should have a couple of people on

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,560
site i guess i don't see so many in the

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,720
room but harry is there hi harry

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,359
good to see you

36
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,760
so the usual note world you should be

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,800
already familiar with them as well

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
you're supposed to be

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
reading them when you subscribe and

40
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
register

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,239
there are rules related to

42
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,959
international property

43
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,200

44
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,760
are depicted here in the bcps listed on

onsite premises

100
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,400
there are

101
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,880
usual behaviors using the queue both on

102
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,120
site and on mythical

103
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
on the links to the notes ietf.org is

104
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,400
right there so feel free to join

105
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,039
as usual

106
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,880
keep in mind that most of the idf work

107
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
is happening on the mailing list so make

108
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,880
sure that at least you participate to do

109
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,759
the polls that are happening on the list

110
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,240
both at adoption time on working blast

111
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,800
code times

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,560
taking part into technical discussion is

113
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,520
also the way we progress work so make

114
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,639
sure that

115
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,360
you dive into it as much as possible we

116
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,600
need people sharing on the making list

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,520
to jet consumption

118
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,199
as chairs as well so try to make use of

119
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,880
the list as much as possible we know

120
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
that sometimes things happen in the

121
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,840
background why not but try also to make

122
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,679
major progress visible on the main list

123
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,080
you may also use it to discuss with the

124
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,479
working group for

125
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,280
site matters like contract allocation

126
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,199
that could happen early depending on the

127
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,039
level of maturity of implementations

128
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,800
we know many of you already know the

129
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,560
staff but in case you have not just

130
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
asked the chairs and we're there to help

131
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,599
and

132
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,120
provide info on trigger processes if

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,680
necessary

134
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,520
next place so at gender bashing you see

135
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,639
both sessions depicted here

136
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,720
anyone want to say something about the

137
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,960
agendas for today and tomorrow

138
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,680

139
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,400

140
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
thank you so

141
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,039
working group status

142
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,680
since the previous ietf

143
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,080
that happened fully remotely

144
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,400
we got one urc about itf psap flow spec

145
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,039
we have one with the isg about

146
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,400
the the binding label in psep there have

147
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,120
been some discussed

148
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,840
raised by the 80s

149
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,039
most of the issues are clears

150
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,960
i guess the discus are also cleared in

151
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,680
the data tracker right now so

152
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,599
we can

153
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,080
hope that this draft will progress on

154
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,800
resume to rfc status

155
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,919
right

156
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,479
far before the next ietf meeting so it's

157
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,919
in good

158
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,318
progress

159
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,840
next

160
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,960
currently

161
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,319
in the working group hands

162
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,280
we have one errata

163
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,330
about a

164
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,159
[Music]

165
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,039
bit

166
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,919
issue or a wrong wording in the big

167
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,559
description the flag description used in

168
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
rfc

169
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,640
8664

170
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
the rata is valid so

171
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,200
this is part of the fix that

172
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,680
should be handled

173
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,760
we have four

174
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,920
drafts currently

175
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,360
with the

176
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,720

at the beginning of the year

183
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,600
so the process is

184
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,720
quite simple in case it's needed for

185
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,120
some implementations about new documents

186
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,480

246
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
let me give the update

247
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,880
uh so we posted a new version uh in

248
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,079
january uh the major changes were

249
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,240
one comment was with respect to use of

250
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,720
ip address no zone

251
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,200
so that change has been made

252
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,320
we had a request to add our pc

253
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,360
to reset all the pcp statistics

254
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,320
so that is done as well so thanks for

255
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
comments from tom petch and robert verga

256
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,160
on this

257
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,440
and uh julian has also made a request

258
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,920
for the yang doctor review so once we

259
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,560
have the yang doctor review uh we will

260
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,880
uh like you know handle that and then i

261
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,600
think this document is nearing working

262
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,399
group last call all our dependencies are

263
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,360
also

264
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
uh nearing working group last call so we

265
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,480
don't have any pending dependency as

266
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,120
such so hopefully this document also we

267
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,639
should be processing soon note that we

268
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,560
had an early young doctor review but

269
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,800
that was for much older version so it

270
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,360
made sense to request young doctor

271
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,560
review again

272
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,399
much nearer to the working group last

273
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,600
call

274
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,839
if anybody has any questions on this

275
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,680
document please let us know

276
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,440
okay otherwise i'll continue

277
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
okay so some other documents that are

278
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,560
nearing working out last call

279
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,760
we have local protection enforcement

280
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
this is on the agenda as the next

281
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,920
document so i will not talk about it

282
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
let's use the agenda time to discuss

283
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,600
that

284
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,079
we have uh

285
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,639
srv6 document

286
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,639
an update was made

287
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,399
and one error which we talked about

288
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,560
errata with f bit

289
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,639
that error existed in this document as

290
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,040
well and it has been fixed

291
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,600
we had some comments in binding said

292
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,519
related to sit structure

293
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,199
so those were applicable to this

294
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,160
document as well and authors have uh

295
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,360
updated the sit structured description

296
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,639
added

297
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,600
also handled one comment with respect to

298
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,360
how to do the optional fields in srv6ero

299
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
so how should we maintain the order of

300
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,040
the various different optional fields in

301
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,600
srv60 so one section has been added so

302
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,839
please review uh this

303
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,560
new uh changes that have been done

304
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,519
and then

305
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,519
uh the binding sid actually has a

306
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,160
normative uh reference to this document

307
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,839
so binding sid has to will be in a

308
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,399
misrep state until this document we send

309
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,600
to the isg and the rfc editor so i think

310
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
we should prioritize moving this work so

311
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
everybody in the working group kindly

312
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,639
review uh this document so that we can

313
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,240
progress it out of the working group

314
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,920
soon

315
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,439
any comments on srv6

316
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,079
okay

317
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,240
more documents we have a pcep native ip

318
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,079
extension

319
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,199
here we have authors made two updates

320
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,440
this has been presented in the idr

321
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,199
interim as well

322
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,839
uh authors ask for request for comments

323
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,720
on the idr list as well where sue had

324
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,360
commented and authors have made an

325
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,320
update

326
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,519
of this document as well so i think uh

327
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,639
we would be

328
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,320
when we do working group last call we

329
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,720
will be doing a cross posting in both

330
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,959
idr list and pc list

331
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:11,760
and

332
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,000
this document is also nearing

333
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,839
a working group last call state

334
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,839
itune if you want to add something

335
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,760
please feel free to use the time

336
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,319
otherwise i'll continue

337
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,040
okay

338
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,759
uh next we have flex grid

339
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,000
uh here we haven't had many technical

340
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,720
changes for a long time i wanted to

341
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,480
check with the authors are there any

342
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,959
pending issues can we consider this

343
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,440
document also to be ready and if there

344
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
is any other review steps that can be

345
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,720
done

346
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,160
to get more eyes on this document

347
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,480
okay

348
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
let's move on

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,560
uh this document we discussed last time

350
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
as well enhanced errors

351
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,880
uh we have had no change

352
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,519
and but we are in a limbo here like you

353
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,360
know last time we thought that we'll ask

354
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,680
the working group to get feedback on

355
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,920
what do we do with this document and

356
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,240
some of the options are listed here

357
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,839
like should we make this work

358
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,040
experimental and try to

359
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,560
commit some reviewers and publish it now

360
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
should we wait for some implementations

361
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,440
to actually implement this

362
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,360
the issue is that we have this feature

363
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,199
but this feature is not currently being

364
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,680
used by any of the document

365
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,160
and one document that we kind of think

366
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
which can use this is the stateful

367
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,839
interdomain document so i hope like the

368
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,600
authors of stateful interdomain and

369
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,199
authors of this document can work

370
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,360
together and give some feedback to the

371
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,839
chairs on what should be the

372
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,800
next

373
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,440
step with respect to this document

374
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,959
so we are still looking for that

375
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,040
feedback and we are especially looking

376
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,680
for feedback from stateful interdomain

377
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,199
authors and other people in the working

378
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,439
group as well on what do it what do they

379
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,679
think should be the next step

380
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,400
for this document so the window is still

381
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,559
open please let us know if you have any

382
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,559
comments now or on the mailing list

383
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,559
okay so some other documents that we

384
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,839
have is

385
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,839
sr path segment

386
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,640
uh there hasn't been no big technical

387
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,000
change uh the work is aligned to changes

388
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,919
that were made in the binding set

389
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,200
recently

390
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
there doesn't seem to be any open issues

391
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
but i wanted to recheck from authors and

392
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,000
others in the working group if they have

393
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,679
any concern with

394
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,600
the path segment work

395
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
uh that is happening in psap and the

396
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,799
related work in spring is also making

397
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,440
progress so i think it will be time for

398
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
us in psep also to

399
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,520
align that work and move it out so if

400
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,600
anybody has any concerns or authors have

401
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,840
any update please let us know

402
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,400
similarly we have sr bidirectional path

403
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,799
the work seems to be stable

404
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,520
we are asking are there any open issues

405
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,039
is there anything that is pending in

406
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,360
this work otherwise we will also start

407
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,120
considering this items as almost ready

408
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,919
for last call so

409
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,000
please let us know

410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,799
next we have uh

411
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,160
we have a

412
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,720
document related to sr policy

413
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,799
there hasn't been an update since the

414
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,960
last itf

415
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,760
so

416
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,559
authors are there any pending issues

417
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,200
anything please use the list discuss

418
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,120
and make sure that the work is aligned

419
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,240
to spring and idr work that is also

420
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,679
happening

421
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,799
uh with respect to pcc sr

422
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,440
we had one update it was a minor update

423
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,280
and i think the work is

424
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,039
looking for more reviews

425
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,160
and

426
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
more eyes on these documents so working

427
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,559
group we have a lot of working group

428
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,440
adopted documents and we are requesting

429
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,360
the working group to do more reviews

430
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,679
give us comments so that we can progress

431
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,200
this document

432
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,640
as a part of normal working group

433
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,880
process

434
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,440
we have stateful interdomain

435
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
uh the stateful interdomain my question

436
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
to the authors is

437
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,799
the part that we just discussed

438
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,880
regarding enhanced errors

439
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,440
if the features of enhanced errors can

440
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,600
be used in stateful inter domain that

441
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,760
would be a good entry point and

442
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,919
a feedback from the working group on how

443
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,600
to progress both the documents together

444
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
we have document related to extended

445
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,919
flags in lsp

446
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,679
i think this work

447
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,160
is important because other documents are

448
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,120
assigning flags as a part of this lsp

449
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,880
extended flag dlv

450
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,039
and we should progress this document

451
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,640
out of the working group soon since we

452
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,559
have other dependencies on this

453
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,480
we have

454
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
multi-path document

455
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,039
this document had a big revision this

456
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,320
time

457
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,760
they had

458
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,400
they added a reverse path information as

459
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,720
a part of iflag

460
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,760
they also added text related to use of

461
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,280
path id 0 and marking it as reserved for

462
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,360
the absence of patae

463
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,559
and there are also some comments from

464
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,200
ipf112 with respect to text related to

465
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,440
sr bi-directional association

466
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
so there is

467
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,320
some pending comments as well so i

468
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,640
request authors to handle it and maybe

469
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,400
discuss these changes that they have

470
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,799
made recently on the mailing list so

471
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,480
that more eyes

472
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,520
are put on this document

473
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,159
the state sync document there was no

474
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,760
update this time

475
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,360
so i will skip over it

476
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,039
we have

477
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,919
optional fields optional objects marking

478
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,720
some of the psep objects as optional

479
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,360
that work also has no recent update

480
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,760
but the document handled the working

481
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
group adoption comments

482
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,840
and there are no pending comments as of

483
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,960
now so people who have feedback please

484
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,720
uh use the mailing list for this and for

485
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
sr p2mp policy

486
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,960
uh since we have adopted that work they

487
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,559
have not been any

488
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,000
uh update

489
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,720
so

490
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
are they comments there is changes that

491
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,120
are happening in other working groups

492
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,039
related to this work so we need to make

493
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,120
sure that the alignment is also

494
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,440
maintained between pim spring idr etc

495
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,880
are related to this work

496
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,000
and

497
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,080
recent adopted documents these were just

498
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
adopted between the last

499
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,559
itf and now we have l2 flow spec

500
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,559
this was the work that was taken out

501
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,360
from the psep flowspec so that it can be

502
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,480
progressed

503
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,919
and all the changes related to rfc 9168

504
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,360
and the idr flow spec v2 work those

505
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
alignment has been done and the authors

506
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,799
have posted uh

507
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,919
an update

508
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,520
so thanks for that

509
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,880
uh we have

510
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,120
sid algo

511
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,840
this was adopted there were comments

512
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,360
during working group adoption but they

513
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,240
are currently pending so request authors

514
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,640
to handle this comment as well

515
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,520
and that will bring me to my last slide

516
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,760
which is our working group adoption

517
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,559
queue

518
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,039
uh this has been updated in our wiki so

519
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,360
please have a look this is the current

520
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,679
order that we would be

521
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,640
using

522
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,880
uh for the recent adoption so next on

523
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,080
queue would be the path mto we have srv6

524
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,640
yang ifit which is actually on the

525
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,400
agenda today as well

526
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,280
and then uh pcc srv6 work as well

527
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
uh and if authors have they feel that

528
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,440
their document is also ready for

529
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,600
adoption please send a note to the

530
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,919
chairs and we will discuss and update

531
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,240
our queues accordingly

532
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,600
so i'll now would request anybody who

533
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,240
has any comments on any of our working

534
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,039
group

535
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,559
adopted work

536
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,640
uh use this time if they want to discuss

537
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
something please use it otherwise we

538
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,600
will go back to the main agenda

539
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,840
from now

540
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,840
i don't see anyone in the queue

541
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,840
okay so let's get on with our agenda

542
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,640
and the first presentation we have is

543
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,880
from andrew

544
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,880
hello everyone uh excuse me can you hear

545
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,279
me okay

546
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,679
yes andrew okay perfect thanks um i'll

547
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,760
be just giving a status update on local

548
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,720
production enforcement um on behalf of

549
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,760
well

550
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
the other co-authors as well

551
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,320
next slide please

552
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,000
so this basically just summarizes really

553
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
what this document is all about

554
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,799
um

555
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,159
the main two things are really that

556
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,360
there's wording and statements around

557
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
the usage of the existing local

558
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,799
protection but

559
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,480
this was really driven because of

560
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,840
interop

561
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,640
misinterpretations on how local

562
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
protection should actually be enforced

563
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,159
and so a lot of the text is really

564
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,440
trying to be you know generally

565
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,279
backwards compatible while actually

566
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,559
clearing up

567
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,320
those misinterpretations

568
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,919
in addition to this there's a new flag

569
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,440
that actually opens up new capabilities

570
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,520
that are used for actually enforcing

571
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,440
that local protection so that way we get

572
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,200
the ability to you know strictly control

573
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,120
whether or not local protection is

574
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,440
actually needed required must be done or

575
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,360
not relevant

576
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,279
so you can see in the diagram there

577
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,720
that's really just a new bit that's

578
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
associated with the lsb attributes

579
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,080
uh next slide please

580
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,039
so the current status is well zero zero

581
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,200
was uploaded in 2019

582
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
it's been presented here to the pc

583
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
working group a couple times

584
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,559
as i mentioned earlier it was adopted in

585
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,919
2020

586
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,760
the code point allowed implementations

587
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,360
to move forward with it

588
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,600
and that code has now been reallocated

589
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,159
so naturally the or renewed rather so

590
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,720
now naturally the concern is making sure

591
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,320
that you know the document can progress

592
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,080
before that early code point actually

593
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
expires again

594
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,919
the draft is pretty much stable you know

595
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,600
in terms of

596
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
the the technical goals that it's trying

597
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,799
to achieve the actual use cases you know

598
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,159
the descriptions

599
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,480
um so really we're just kind of seeking

600
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,760
you know moving towards working group

601
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,840
last call so that way we can kind of

602
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,360
wrap this up a little bit

603
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,400
uh next slide please

604
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,080
um but actually before doing that i went

605
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,679
back and looked at that now to see if

606
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,600
there was anything outstanding and there

607
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,039
was really just some kind of open

608
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,360
comments about you know generalizing the

609
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,520
conflict of enforcement

610
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
um so that ebit flag you know should

611
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,159
that be generalized for all object and

612
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,520
visa or all attributes and visa

613
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,480
and again these are just kind of

614
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,240
generalized comments so i'm just trying

615
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,080
to address it here in the group and

616
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,159
actually we can take this little list

617
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,080
so the main question i think is you know

618
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,440
is this actually required by this

619
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,480
document

620
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
or is it safe and okay to you know

621
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,559
proceed with that new ebit flag being

622
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,120
defined as it is in the document

623
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,640
so as a reminder to that you know there

624
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,960
is the pc optional document which covers

625
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,039
generalizing object enforcement

626
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,960
in this case these are attribute flags

627
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,320
so it doesn't get covered by that

628
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,679
document

629
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,440
so there was an idea proposed on the

630
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,360
list to basically you know move object

631
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,440
flags into the tlv

632
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,159
and

633
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,720
follow a similar pattern that rfc 5420

634
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,640
was doing

635
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,799
but it was also an open suggestion and

636
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,000
so

637
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,840
um at the current moment you know you

638
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
basically see that it doesn't really

639
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,600
seem necessary at this time just because

640
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,080
we do have bits available

641
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,600
naturally it would be good for the group

642
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,919
to you know progress in that direction

643
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,679
um but i'm basically raising this topic

644
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,039
that just you know

645
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,960
get consensus on whether or not we think

646
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,799
it's perfectly fine to just use the ebit

647
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,679
as it is or if this is like a must you

648
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,480
know move in this kind of direction so

649
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,840
again seeking uh just some kind of

650
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,600
consensus on that

651
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,959
and uh next slide please

652
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,679
and that's everything i've got so look

653
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,600
forward to any uh comments or

654
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
clarification really on this kind of

655
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,080
slide thanks

656
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,880
yes thanks andrew are there any

657
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,360
questions

658
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
please use the meet echo queue for both

659
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,440
on-site and of course the online folks

660
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,279
and we'll be following the meet echo cue

661
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,159
uh so just my personal opinion and

662
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,240
without any hacks

663
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,159
uh i would think that like you know what

664
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,559
you are proposing seems to be rational

665
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,000
is we can

666
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,960
keep this work as a separate entity

667
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,720
and uh if there is a need for

668
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,679
doing this thing for for flags maybe

669
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,399
that can be handled as a part of pce

670
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,360
optional because that document is anyway

671
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,799
focusing on

672
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,880
how this how to do this optional work

673
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,840
for objects and if there is a need to do

674
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,640
that per flag and there is some

675
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,880
suggestion for it maybe we can handle

676
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,480
that in

677
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,720
optional document and anyway we are a

678
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,480
volunteer driven

679
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,520
uh

680
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,360
like you know organization so the people

681
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,200
who have that comment and have a

682
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,480
proposal on hand maybe they can provide

683
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,760
that as uh input to pc option and since

684
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,880
pc optional is now an adopted work

685
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,279
it can be updated as a part of normal

686
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,279
working group process so there is

687
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,440
nothing that is blocking this to be

688
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,480
handled

689
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,960
within the working group but as well so

690
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,720
if anybody has any thoughts on this

691
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,039
comments uh if i remember correctly it

692
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,840
was pawan who had this coming so he can

693
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,080
also confirm now or on the mailing list

694
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,399
whether he likes this approach

695
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,120
or not oh i see him in the queue

696
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,239
uh pawan go ahead

697
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,279
yeah uh yeah it was me who

698
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,279
made that comment um

699
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,320
i still would like to see

700
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,559
a generalized approach for this but yeah

701
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,679
i mean

702
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,480
i haven't put that said i haven't uh

703
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,120
contributed any text or uh published a

704
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,440
new new craft for discussing this so i'm

705
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,120
good with whatever is

706
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,200
currently being come

707
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,919
but yeah but

708
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,440
i i would like to see a general way of

709
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,159
imposing that

710
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,080
but can i ask one question is it okay if

711
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
that is handled outside of this document

712
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,679
i'm okay with that yeah

713
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,559
for now i mean you're saying

714
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,640
for just for this particular flag we'll

715
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,279
have this additional uh there will be an

716
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,279
additional enforcement pack but for any

717
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,320
other

718
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,360
attribute if you want to enforce it uh

719
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,200
yeah i mean

720
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,000
we can transfer that as part of the

721
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,720
pc operations

722
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,960
okay

723
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,120
thanks

724
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,760
i'm due go ahead

725
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,919
i just want to say thanks and uh yeah it

726
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,600
does sound reasonable to you know embed

727
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,520
this into the optional document

728
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
just because it's really about you know

729
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
do you actually respect these attributes

730
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,720
of these flags and the optional just

731
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,120
seems like the natural place to put it

732
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,399
so that seems

733
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,679
pretty reasonable

734
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,760
yeah thanks

735
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,480
uh boris sorry i missed you so

736
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,799
please

737
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,880
go ahead yeah a

738
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,799
very short question draft says about

739
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,880
implementations for both nokia and cisco

740
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,840
rvs engineering versions or general ones

741
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,440
i could speak on nokia's behalf

742
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,399
currently they're engineering loads

743
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,360
uh while you were presenting uh

744
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,840
i saw one more thing like you know uh

745
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
maybe we need to do a little bit more

746
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,519
language check one thing which i found

747
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,679
maybe not the best the use of the term

748
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,960
must constrain and may constraint

749
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,720
i'm not sure that would be the best way

750
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,600
to describe a mandatory

751
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,760
field an optional field like you know

752
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,000
whether we could use the word must

753
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,320
constraint as a term so maybe we can

754
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,159
find out what is the best description of

755
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,039
this flag as well i think as in

756
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,039
implementers you and i understand what

757
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,519
that means but is that the best way to

758
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,720
frame this

759
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,279
uh that's something also worth looking

760
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,360
at

761
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,240
okay um yeah definitely uh

762
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,760
i guess try to see if there's a way

763
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,360
maybe to extend on that

764
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,559
really can explain it a little bit

765
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,159
better

766
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,360
perfect

767
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,279
um thank you

768
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,000
so

769
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,279
i i guess

770
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,120
if if that was

771
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,640
i guess the last comment that would be

772
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,799
kind of need to be addressed

773
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,559
um does the group think that we can

774
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,320
probably move towards working group last

775
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,679
call over the you know the next year or

776
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,840
so

777
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,600
uh i think we should uh we should

778
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,240
respect the especially the renew

779
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,960
uh

780
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,720
like the deadline that we have in mind

781
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,080
with respect to

782
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,120
uh

783
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,440
the ina early code point so we should

784
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,039
definitely aim for

785
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,840
uh getting this document uh working with

786
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,159
call accordingly and i will discuss this

787
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,159
with julian and prioritize this

788
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,159
accordingly once you have updated the

789
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,799
last set of comments

790
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,440
great thank you

791
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,679
okay

792
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,600
uh i don't see anybody else in the queue

793
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,039
so

794
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,039
let's

795
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,918
you are next yeah go ahead

796
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,640
uh hello everyone this is sean from city

797
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,120
my presentation today is the presab

798
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,919
extension for srmps entropy level

799
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,440
position

800
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,399
let's snipe this

801
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,919
and this draft has been

802
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,960
presented for three times and we got

803
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
marrying comments from many lists and

804
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,159
the meetings

805
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,559
and they are

806
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:32,880
appreciated from stephen duke paris

807
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,399
vamping jeff and tom thank you very much

808
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,480
we made uh updates before version seven

809
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,080
uh for example we moved the uh d-page to

810
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,919
lsp extended flags and we made free uh

811
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,039
clarification for the msd and the erld

812
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,640
limitations and requirements in pc in

813
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,000
into domain scenario we've also made a

814
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,360
clarification for ingress capability

815
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,000
and the ebay is used to indicate the

816
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,720
capability over inserting

817
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,239
multiple el ielps and pcc and the

818
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,040
support and the sr pass with prp from pc

819
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,320
at the same time and so finally we made

820
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,040
clarification for their el iel positions

821
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,639
calculated for

822
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,839
sr pass

823
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,359
so this time

824
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,239
we

825
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,800
made updates uh actually version 7

826
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,918
first we made clarification for pc to

827
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,480
get msb and the erld capabilities and

828
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,679
adding reference to existing underlying

829
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,520
igp extensions including ecs and ospf

830
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,399
this

831
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,280
comments from the jeff and we've also

832
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,480
made a clarification and we would remove

833
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,240
the minimum er ldtf

834
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,359
because this is not necessary and

835
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,640
finally we made a synchrolized update

836
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,599
and

837
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,960
keeping consistent with the extension of

838
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,280
hp protocol

839
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,680
so last

840
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,119
uh so let's do the recap of the

841
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,240
background

842
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,760
the

843
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,320
uh

844
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,800
rc-862 proposes to apply the entropy

845
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,240
label to simplest networks and provide

846
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,800
the pla fly

847
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,079
criteria to determine the best er ielts

848
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,160
placement

849
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,880
in rfc

850
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,359
8662 the ingress may not spend the

851
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,480
minimum

852
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,920
erld unknown path and does not support

853
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,000
the computation of their

854
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,480
in minimum erld

855
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,960
so controller for example the pc may

856
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,119
perform the the

857
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,680
to end possible computation as well as

858
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,320
well as the entire entropy label

859
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,359
position

860
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,160
uh

861
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,200
including the lambo and third place

862
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,480
uh so

863
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,680
uh we can uh the

864
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,920
proposed psap extensions to uh contrib

865
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,040
uh computer uh

866
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,839
parts is uh especially in inter domain

867
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,320
scenarios uh with the uh er i l els

868
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,200
number and place

869
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,240
last slide please

870
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,680
so we propose some precept extensions

871
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,560
first of all the pc could get the

872
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,440
information such as msd and the el rld

873
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,640
through igp and their

874
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,880
compute the minimum erld unknown n2n

875
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,119
pass first for example the year erld

876
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,040
value can be collected for ease and ospf

877
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,720
and the msd value also can be collected

878
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,200
for rc84 like 1 and ospf

879
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,839
rfc 8476

880
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,920
then we also proposed

881
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,200
a e bit to set to 1 in srpc capability

882
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,960
in open object

883
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,800
when the eb set to one it indicates as

884
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,000
it supports the as sr pass computation

885
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,400
with uh erp new uh configuration also it

886
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,200
also indicates that uh the it supports

887
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,480
the capability of inserting multiple eri

888
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,119
erpls at pcc

889
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,000
last night please

890
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,520
uh we also uh proposed the ebit in lsp

891
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,040
extended flag to in lsb object to

892
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,160
indicate the pcc requests pc to compute

893
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,000
the sr pass with erp information

894
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,680
finally we

895
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,800
add ebit to set one to the in

896
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,280
srero sublet object to indicate the

897
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,400
position

898
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,920
after the srel ero sub object is the

899
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,359
position to insert the pairs otherwise

900
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,560
it cannot insert pairs after the segment

901
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,440
next like this

902
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,200
so this document has been discussed many

903
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,240
times in details at the meetings and the

904
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,839
under mailing list

905
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,520
and all comments have has been resolved

906
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,599
and thanks for your comments and

907
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,160
suggestion and the

908
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,839
the uh according pgp

909
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,400
extension

910
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,520
the draft

911
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,920
idr bgp srm plc erp the draft has been

912
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,320
in adoption queue and

913
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,359
so this this document has made

914
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,400
according updates and being in

915
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,760
accordance with the bgp extensions so i

916
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,040
think it's ready for

917
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,880
adoption

918
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,760
thank you very much

919
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,760
thank you

920
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,320
are there any questions

921
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,880
i don't see any questions

922
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,599
uh thanks for updating the documents and

923
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,599
handling all the comments that you have

924
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,400
received so the last set of comments as

925
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,880
you said was related to removing the

926
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,760
minimum erlt tlv and after that there

927
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,920
are no other open no

928
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,560
comments from

929
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,599
sorry i got little feedback so let me

930
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,520
say that again are there any other open

931
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,400
issues

932
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,880
from previous meetings or mailing list

933
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,560
no as i know as far as i know

934
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,880
this staff draft has no comments

935
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,400
thank you

936
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,319
julian and i will discuss and will

937
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,880
update the wiki accordingly thank you

938
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,280
thank you

939
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,599
okay so let's move on to the last

940
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,960
presentation for today

941
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,480
giuseppe

942
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,920
yeah please go ahead

943
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,599
hello everybody this is an update about

944
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,200
the document on cset extensions for ics

945
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,960
i'm presenting on the alpha scroll

946
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,480
router so netflix

947
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,200
just a few words about background and

948
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,640
motivation so i feed the first two bots

949
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,599
in c2im and alternate mapping

950
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,240
the base draft about methodology are

951
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,079
quite stable so you can see the

952
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,119
reference document

953
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,359
yeah we all know that the psep extension

954
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,720
can be used

955
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,800
to

956
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,040
of course to signal in this case the

957
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,720
effect capabilities

958
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,560
these allow

959
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,599
to

960
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,680
have the effect methods automatically

961
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,240
activated and running

962
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,079
the draft

963
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,000
proposed to

964
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,400
define the fit attributes and to be

965
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,960
generalized as pld in the lspa object

966
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,160
and

967
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,440
the draft is general so it means that it

968
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,920
can be applied for all part type as long

969
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,520
as they support the data plane method

970
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,160
next slide

971
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,640
the first

972
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,280
extension that is proposed is the effect

973
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,200
capability tld

974
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,160
uh that is an optional cld to be used in

975
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,920
the open object

976
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,880
uh there are five flags defined within

977
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,640
the draft so

978
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,560
four are for the

979
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,079
iom

980
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,400
uh different option type so

981
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
pre-allocated stress option type

982
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,040
incremental press option type direct

983
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,200
export option type and then to end

984
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,000
option type and the last flag is for the

985
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,800
alternate smart

986
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,640
next slide

987
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,720
and then we also define the ic touch us

988
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,240
lv that provides the configurable nodes

989
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,640
for the effect feature

990
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,359
and it is general and it includes

991
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,800
different subtleties

992
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,160
for the lspa object

993
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,880
in the next glide we can see the five

994
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,440
sub leds that

995
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
we proposed

996
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,000
uh of course these i5 tlbs are optional

997
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
and can be taken into account by the pce

998
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,839
or by the

999
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:01,119
pcc uh next slide

1000
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,280
yeah you can see there the

1001
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,920
five sub tlds that can be included in

1002
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,760
the fit attributes tld

1003
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,760
four are for iom feature and one is for

1004
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,640
alternate masters

1005
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,960
next slide

1006
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,880
yeah in this slide we just summarize the

1007
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,400
lattice changes after

1008
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,040
ips112

1009
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,280
we revised the iana considerations part

1010
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,640
uh and we added different sub subsection

1011
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,760
for the precept qld type ip capability

1012
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,839
tlv flags

1013
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,240
uh and if it attributes of dlv in

1014
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,720
addition we added the new subsection for

1015
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,880
enhanced alternate margin sub tld flags

1016
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,760
and also a new subset uh subsection for

1017
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,400
psi period code just to

1018
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,480
keep the structure

1019
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,640
in line with other pc documents

1020
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,279
next slide

1021
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,920
okay yeah we consider this document

1022
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,880
relevant to enable like feed

1023
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
for control mechanisms

1024
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,359
uh it's worth mentioning that

1025
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,000
synthetic methods are becoming natural

1026
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,640
for ipv6 srm tls and srv6 this this

1027

1048
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,960
our working group adoption queue which

1049
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,040
you saw in my slides

1050
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,119
and we would uh like you know putting

1051
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,920
this up uh after i think two documents

1052
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,839
are in the queue and then we will do

1053
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,240
iflip

1054
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,200
okay and please please uh keep the

1055
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,280
document aligned with the other work

1056
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,200
that is happening in other working group

1057
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,760
because i think you have uh ifit work in

1058
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,200
rppm and also proposal in idr

1059
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,880
so just make sure that the documents are

1060
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,200
aligned from the start rather than

1061
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,920
doing that at the end of the process

1062
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,920
sure sure i will double check with idr

1063
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,800
document of course

1064
