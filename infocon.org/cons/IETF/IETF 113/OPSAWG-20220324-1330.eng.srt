15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,400
sure you've all seen it and read it but

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
there we go my private my uh

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
confidence monitor went off um but as a

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
reminder all of your contributions

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
everything you see at the mic is uh is

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,159
public and subject to the um the ietf

21
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,400
processes and policies

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
as another note

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,840
we are a

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,119
collaborative

25
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,720
group of people we're all working

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,399
towards a common goal of making the

27
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,680
internet better

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
so as such we

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
have requests

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,159
that you would treat each other with

31
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,680
respect

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,000
and that's that anti-harassment

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,360
procedure there as well

34
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,079
so this is our first hybrid meeting i

35
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,680
mean i guess you could say we've always

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,080
kind of been hybrid we've always had

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
some remote participants but this is

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
unique we are

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,840
for the first time since singapore and

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,640
in

41
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
2019 we have some in-person

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,319
participation

43
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,120
you can either choose to join that with

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,680
the the meat echo app so you can see a

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
qr code if you're here in the room if

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
you scan that on your phone or mobile

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,160
device you'll have the meat echo light

48
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
version um if you are presenting with

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
that you can use it to adjust the slides

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,239
but it looks like we have a clicker

51
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,519
actually i don't think that clicker will

52
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,319
work so we can also move the slides for

53
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,040
you

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,599
um and if you wish you can join the meet

55
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,280
echo heavy uh by clicking on the video

56
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
icon in the data tracker agenda

57
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
and you can follow along for remote

58
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
participants this worked just like

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,080
before hopefully you're all signed in to

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
meet echo and like i said i see a number

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,159
of people there so it looks like that's

62
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,040
all being very successful

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,599
um what we're going to do is go through

64
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,680
our agenda

65
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,080

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,319
had all the information you need so you

67
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,319

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
in the last call sorry in the um

172
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,280
production uh call for adoption in which

173
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,800
we received they would tell a lot of

174
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,319
useful comments from the uh from the

175
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,520
working group

176
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,759
and that revealed i would say a lot of

177
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,919
issues that are listed in the in the

178
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,199
next slide

179
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,880
so basically there is one i would say

180
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,240
one important thing that was raised by

181
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,120
benue that we if you want if you can

182
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,319
just please move to the next slide

183
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,280
as we uh we are i would say assigning

184
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,840
the uh or associating multiple services

185
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,680
to uh to the same service attachment

186
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,479
points there is a need to um to uh to

187
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,440
amaze to display and to use filters just

188
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,520
to uh specifically have a topology for a

189
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,240
given service and not for all of them um

190
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,160
with the old version we have with the

191
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
model that was really difficult to do so

192
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,479
the um this was one of the um i would

193
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,479
say important feedback we received from

194
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,400
from the working group uh there's also

195
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
another comment from the uh from dhruv

196
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
then this one is also important is how

197
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,440
to associate between the um the service

198
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
attachment topology and the the the

199
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,000
physical one so we need to have a glue

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,479
somewhere in the model to to um to let

201
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,319
us i would say easily

202
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,559
graft the uh distilled attachment point

203
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,440
topology into the the physical one

204
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,760
uh there are also uh various issues that

205
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,880
was really i would say

206
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,919
for example if you want to cover uh not

207
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,080
only the um the user to the network

208
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
interface but also for the services that

209
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,480
are i would say

210
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
requested from a pure network and for

211
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,440
that one we need to have i would say

212
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
some discussion about the um the network

213
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,600
network network interface

214
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,640
and there are also um a lack of examples

215
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,040
to illustrate how the model can be put

216
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
in into practice

217
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
so in order to um to address all of

218
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
these issues we we have updated and

219
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
proceeded with many

220
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
revisions of the specification that can

221
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
be uh shown in the next slide

222
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240
um so

223
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,399
rather than index in the uh the serious

224
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,680
attachment points by its id we are we we

225
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,200
are now having something which is

226
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,920
structured based on the service itself

227
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
and

228
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,160
under that the service we have uh added

229
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,279
multiple um leaves and parameters there

230
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,959
in order to um

231
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,880
uh to address all of the issues that

232
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
were i would say listed in the in the

233
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,760
previous slide we also added a lot of

234
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,200
examples uh as appendixes uh to uh

235
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
really illustrate how the model can be

236
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,760
used in various contexts

237
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,560
we

238
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,600
used vpn for uh here for uh for that

239
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,080
purpose because the the working of is

240
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
working on i would say in ill two and

241
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,480
three eight three uh services but the

242
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,839
the same exercise can be done for other

243
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,760
services uh we use also to have one

244
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
comment from from joe about the uh the

245
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
mapping

246
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,000
uh and for that also uh we have we have

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,480
added multiple examples like next to to

248
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,279
to explain how we can we can we can we

249
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,680
can manipulate the model in order to use

250
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,519
the map in between the service and the

251
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,440
service attachment topology next one

252
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,680
please

253
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,760
um we also receive the um

254
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,160
the yank docker reviews there's nothing

255
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,320
i would say

256
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,519
major there

257
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,160
there is only comments some nits about

258
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,480
um renaming some some leaves and so on

259
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
and it was really straightforward but

260
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,560
but but that's still a good a good

261
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,040
review from for from martin either for

262
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
that we don't we don't have any um any

263
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,720
other appendance on this document that

264
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,399
we think that we are we are ready for

265
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,560
the working of last call and know that

266
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,079
that venue

267
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,000
is is currently a review and the uh i

268
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
would say the draft to to check the uh

269
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,600
the mapping we

270
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,560
i mentioned earlier but this can can be

271
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,839
handled as part of the working of

272
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,760
classical if the worker decides so

273
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,959
all right any comments or questions uh

274
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,399
on service attachment points

275
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
i i didn't know i appreciate the

276
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
revision and i noticed benoit had i

277
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,880
didn't get to read it yet um just before

278
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,360
i came here and like i mentioned med

279
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
will ah looks like scott's joining the

280
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
queue

281
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,160
and you're here scott go ahead

282
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,800
scott

283
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
hello there we go

284
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,839
there you go i was triply muted

285
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,959
apologize so okay so can you go back to

286
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,600
the tree i just have a simple question i

287
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
hope it's simple

288
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,200
uh right there this tree so

289
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
i what i'm seeing here is that you have

290
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,200
a node and then you have a service with

291
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,800
a service type but service type is a key

292
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,720
an identity re so

293
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
is that really a

294
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,920
type or is that an

295
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,600
a pointer to an instance of a service

296
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,680
because the way i'm looking at this you

297
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,200
could only have

298
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,079
one service

299
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,000
you could only have one service of a

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
service type for a node couldn't there

301
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
be multiple services that are the same

302
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
running over a node

303
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,240
just

304
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,920
looking for some clarification there

305
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,839
thanks

306
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,240
yeah that that that's a good observation

307
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,000
actually you can have multiple services

308
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,399
under the same node and the

309
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,560
the multiplexing will be done by the

310
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,200
attachment interface itself in which you

311
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
for example you can have multiple sub

312
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,639
interfaces that can be associated with

313
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,880
the same service and you can use that as

314
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,839
a demultiplexer if you need that

315
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,160
other comments

316
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
i see rob approaching the mic

317
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
uh robertson cisco as a contributor in

318
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,079
that scenario though wouldn't you end up

319
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,920
finding the

320
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,240
sub interface as the

321
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,639
uh service interface

322
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,079
the circuit interface

323
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,399
what does the sap always define the

324
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,199
physical interface

325
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
the sub does not always require a sub

326
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,880
interface to be present but it um

327
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,240
but

328
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
i'm not sure the cd and the case you are

329
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,399
you are referring to is so if you can

330
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,160
just i would say clarify for that would

331
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,560
be great uh if you yeah if you had

332
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,199
multiple um pseudo-wires point-to-point

333
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,680
survivors or vps surfaces then they

334
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
would all be terminating for the same pe

335
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,639
device

336
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,040
and each of those would have a separate

337
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,399
sub-interface

338
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,839
on that on a given pe

339
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,279
interface um to each of those different

340
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,720
services i just wanted to check that

341
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
that could be modeled here basically on

342
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,160
on the back of scott's comment

343
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,000
yeah um yeah i need to check this one

344
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
for the

345
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,040
specific specific case

346
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,839
i can do that offline to to really check

347
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,720
it if

348
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,279
it works on that on that case as well

349
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,920
okay thank you

350
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
dhruv i see you in the queue i think

351
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,399
this will be our last question thanks uh

352
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,680
drove here uh one question met uh in the

353
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,079
document we say that this model can be

354
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,320
seen as an inventory model

355
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,120
and i have a little query on that like

356
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
you know because i i also noticed that

357
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
in c camp there is a document and they

358
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,920
are also asking for feedback on where to

359
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,160
do the network inventory model and i all

360
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,800
my first question is is can really this

361
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,560
model be seen as an inventory model i

362
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,720
wanted to get a feedback from the room

363
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,519
as well or are we misclassifying this

364
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,600
and also to notify the working group

365
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,160
what do they feel about a work that has

366
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,040
been done in ccamp on the itf network

367
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,600
inventory is that something that we need

368
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,680
to also be looking at in this area

369
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,600
yeah that that that's a good question

370
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,759
for me it's still an inventory model but

371
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,839
yeah it's up to the working group to um

372
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,279
i would say to check the other work and

373
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,720
to see if there is something to be here

374
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,440
to be said there

375
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,680
thanks

376
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,040
thank you very much

377
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,040
ned

378
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,000
rob i think i can remove you from the

379
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
queue

380
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,560
okay

381
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,000
um

382
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,480
next up bow

383
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,759
can you hear me

384
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,600
we can

385
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,000
thank you

386
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,720
hello everyone this is paul

387
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,800
uh i'm going to present this uh

388
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,440
young model for network and vpn service

389
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,160
performance monitoring drug on behalf of

390
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,720
all the authors

391
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,759
uh next please

392
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
uh

393
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,920
the first thing i want the working group

394
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,639
to be noticed that is that this draft

395
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,800
has just to close on the working group

396
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,240
last call

397
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,360
and during this last uh working group

398
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,880
lab school we received uh

399
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,639
several

400
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,759
helpful comments from the minutes so we

401
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,919
thank adrian

402
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,079
joe for their helpful

403
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,599
comments

404
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,959
and

405
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,480
uh

406
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,400
these uh

407
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,480
in all these comments we have a major

408
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,439
uh

409
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,640
there's a

410
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,199
comment uh there's a suggestion that uh

411
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,880
that

412
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,600
inter site between performance monetary

413
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,559
type can be added to the model

414
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,160
because uh right now uh like before this

415
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,360
um

416
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,799
in this zero three uh version we have

417
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,080
only uh

418
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,480
tunnel based vpn performance monitor

419
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,600
type

420
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,559
so

421
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,039
uh now we'll talk in the next

422
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,559
slide

423
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,640
and uh we also in the github uh

424
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,679
hacked all the issues that we all and we

425
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,000
also uh addressed all those issues so

426
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,960
thank you

427
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,520
next please

428
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,240
and here is the

429
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,520
the

430
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,960
comments that i just mentioned

431
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
uh i put a figure here that to show what

432
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,360
the

433
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,719
comment is about

434
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,080
like before uh

435
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,200
like this

436
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,919
uh there's three uh version we have only

437
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,200
the tunnel uh we put uh in a

438
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
blue color that

439
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,000
in

440
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,480
the overlay uh vpn uh topology their

441
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,799
workflow link between this virtual node

442
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,640
that represent a qpe there

443
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,400
and uh

444
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,679
but we

445
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,919
we don't have that um

446
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,320
we don't have exact volume method to

447
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,760
measure the virtual link oem so we use

448
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
the tunnel

449
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,240
performance monitor metric to represent

450
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,520
that virtual link om

451
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,280
statistics

452
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
so um there's

453
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
the comments is about that

454
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,120
it also should be allowed that like

455
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,640
inter uh vpn access interface

456
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,960
uh that that because they are uh

457
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,360
there are um already uh some common uh

458
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,640
praxis there that uh used uh

459
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,799
uh like t-ramp

460
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,840
and other oem method can be used to

461
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,280
measure that

462
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,160
per vpn uh

463
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,120
uh

464
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,520
performance monitoring so

465
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,960
uh

466
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,559
so in the

467
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,679
the first uh revision four we add a a

468
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,280
new node

469
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,720
uh we call it uh vpn performance type

470
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,120
and we also use the choice definition so

471
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,400
the reason why we choose uh type choice

472
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,360
is that

473
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,960
we think the inter vpn access interface

474
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,919
performance monitor can cover the

475
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,760
like the the tunnel part uh

476
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,960
measurement so we think

477
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,919
so these methods two measures uh on

478
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,400
either of them can be used

479
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,280
to represent vpn performance monitoring

480
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,120
uh that abstract link performance

481
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,880
monitoring so

482
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,080
that's the reason we choose choice so we

483
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,720
like to hear uh if there are other

484
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,880
uh comments on this

485
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,200
so

486
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
uh this is a major

487
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,799
one left for the working group

488
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,880
discussion

489
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,440
and that

490
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,799
text please

491
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,880
so uh since uh we think they have

492
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,080
addressed all the issues so the next

493
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,919
step is the

494
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,240
the author's impress

495
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
iesd publication

496
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,840
so that's

497
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,760
all are there any comments on them

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,960
comments

499
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,360
um bo on the um

500
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,919
on this choice

501
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,600
yes

502
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
do you think you have enough

503
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,000
so last hall is is

504
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
like i mentioned wound down do you have

505
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,720
enough input here is there

506
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,960
others in particular that you would like

507
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,480
to get um

508
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,440
insight or or thoughts on

509
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,679
before handing this up to the iesg

510
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,720
uh right now we we have published uh

511
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,520
revision4 to

512
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,880
like already uh add this

513
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,559
choice so i don't know if that make uh

514
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,120
our working group labs call

515
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
like

516
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,840
their other

517
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,080
is need another uh

518
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,039
last call you

519
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,430
um

520
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,720
[Music]

521
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
i don't know um

522
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
listening to you talk it sounded like

523
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,120
there might need to be some other eyes

524
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,000
on this it seems like a substantive

525
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,600
change that just snuck in once the

526
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,679
window opened

527
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,880
it might benefit from another week or so

528
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,360
once things settle down

529
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440
i i'd like to understand

530
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,600
how

531
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
what you feel um you you feel

532
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,280
comfortable with

533
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
um given given what you've just stated

534
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,440
here

535
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,799
oh i'm i'm fine with uh you

536
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,640
i mean uh we definitely um

537
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,960
we discussed this uh is to like

538
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,840
we we hope that a working group can have

539
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,559
more review on this because in that way

540
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,679
that will be more uh the text and also

541
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,440
the model will be refined so

542
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,000
i think uh from my viewer i'm buying

543
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,280
this so

544
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,720
if matt

545
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,679
and other authors don't have other

546
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,360
like

547
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,440
they don't have other opinions on

548
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,159
filemakers

549
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,840
okay

550
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
thank you

551
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,679
other comments got a few minutes

552
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,280
okay thank you bo

553
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,600
thank you

554
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,760
benoit

555
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,760
all right so i'm going to present the

556
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
same work

557
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,520
i'm trying to buy you some minutes

558
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,480
something to talk right now

559
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,559
well

560
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,799
it would have helped to put it in order

561
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,240
there you go

562
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,120
we did all right

563
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,159
so okay we produced new versions of this

564
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,159
this work uh i'm going to be quick here

565
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,240
and again by you some minutes so the

566
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,120
next slides i've got one intro

567
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,400
on what this work is about i printed

568
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,640
multiple times i don't plan to go

569
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,600
through it

570
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,400
if it's new to you quickly review the

571
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,240
the slides

572
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,320
now on the next slide joe

573
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,880
we added in in the version two of the

574
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
draft we added

575
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
information about circular dependencies

576
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,039
there were discussions with edius lear

577
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,000
and rob so we added that in this latest

578
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,840
version we added a specific example

579
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,400
of uh you know how to uh

580
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,360
prevent circular dependencies

581
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,279
okay

582
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,400
in the next slide please

583
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,159
what we've been adding also and that

584
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,960
came from our prototype is that

585
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
whenever we have like the health score

586
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,440
for a subservice

587
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,679
sometimes we don't have it yet because

588
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,840
we're busy calculating

589
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,480
in the prototype you're reporting zero

590
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,600
as a health and somehow it was a mistake

591
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,919
it was just missing right it was selling

592
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,679
the wrong information the service was

593
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,400
not

594
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,200
up and running so we could be waiting

595
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
until it's stable but what we choose to

596
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,159
do is the proper way in yang by having a

597
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,279
union

598
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,320
it's either missing or it's calculated

599
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,600
it's calculated it gives you the health

600
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
score

601
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,279
so that's an improvement

602
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,880
okay on the next slide please

603
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,880
i want to stress that we've got some

604
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,520
implementation of that

605
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,480
the day x agent by de lies university

606
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,679
has been presented already at the itf a

607
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,799
couple of

608
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,279
ideas ago

609
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,279
we have this picture from a prototype

610
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,520
that was done at cisco that was coming

611
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,919
it's coming from the

612
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,559
the presentation in the itf also and

613
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,399
we've got the huawei prototype as well

614
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,520
on the next slides

615
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,279
the status is that i want to thank the

616
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,120
people who provided feedback

617
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,600
there is no more issue except that there

618
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,159
is a discussion on the list with joe and

619
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,720
we need to update the the yang

620
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,760
module one more time with the counter 64

621
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,320
on the version

622
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,840
and after that i believe that we are

623
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,440
close to being done

624
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
and from the other point of view

625
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,640
we're close to a good last call

626
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,159
um as a contributor i i responded to

627
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,919
john today

628
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:58,720
i

629
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,960
yes okay the version i'm not in love

630
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,400
with it but whatever

631
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,520
the the example that the like

632
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,440
implementation suggestion i think would

633
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,720
also be a useful addition um

634
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,400
just for others who might want to

635
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,559
understand how best to

636
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,559
to implement some of the the health and

637
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,559
weighting

638
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,640
so we're going to post a new version

639
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,200
very quick yes

640
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,360
and after that

641
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,639
it's up to you guys

642
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,320
comments on sane

643
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,000
see anyone coming up so thank you benoit

644
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,879
wow cranking right along uh thomas

645
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,399
yes can you hear me

646
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,520
we can we can perfect

647
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,279
thanks a lot joe

648
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,440
so i'm talking about uh

649
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,440
yeah just one sec

650
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,440
so now is it better

651
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,880
is it better yes it's better thank you

652
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
okay perfect

653
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,279
so i'm thomas from swisscom so this is

654
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,000
about export of segment routing ipv6

655
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,960
information in ipfix

656
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,840
next slide please

657
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,279
so just to give some background so uh

658
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,000
segment routing uh can be leveraged in

659
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,399
the ampeles data plane and also in the

660
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,640
ipv6 data plane

661
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,679
so we have with rfc9160

662
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,399
uh the extensions needed for

663
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,520
adopting it on ampullar segment routing

664
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,240
just in a nutshell to describe uh

665
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,919
basically the ipfix entity 70

666
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,720
describes the mpls top label stack

667
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,760
section

668
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,480
which basically describes the label the

669
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,000
the the

670
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,080
experimental bit and the

671
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,880
bottom of the stack bit while the

672
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,520
basically the rest of the amplis label

673
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,720
stack is decomposed in ibifix entity

674
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,640
71 to 79 separately

675
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,880
the ibfx entity 47 basically exposes the

676
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,120
ample stop label ipv4 address while ib

677
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,520
entity for 46

678
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
basically from which

679
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,120
routing protocol

680
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,480
that

681
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,679
prefix and label has been coming from

682
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,080
and since this was the only change

683
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,399
between emperors and mpls segment

684
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,640
routing so basically there were new

685
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,559
routing protocols such as ospf isis and

686
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,520
also pgp and

687
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,000
pc being introduced

688
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,279
uh we are

689
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,799
updating the

690
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:09,480
the

691
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,360
ipfix top label type registry

692
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,240
next slide please

693
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,720
so in order to bring uh data plane

694
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,919
visibility in srv6 uh

695
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,720
basically in a nutshell uh we are um

696
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,000
uh

697
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,320
so in

698
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,080
so currently uh sov6 is already deployed

699
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,559
in service provider networks we have the

700
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,640
first few cases which are actually

701
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,080
providers are

702
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,399
migrating from mpls towards sov6

703
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,840
and we believe as autos it's

704
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,000
currently data plane visibility is

705
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,960
missing especially in such uh migration

706
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,320
scenarios

707
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,200
uh it's very beneficial that we can see

708
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,919
actually uh how much traffic is being

709
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,840
forwarded or dropped

710
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,760
towards a seat

711
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,519
so

712
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,799
in order to gain visibility into srv6

713
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,799
basically the segment routing header

714
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,200
needs to be exposed uh the segment

715
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,559
routing has

716
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,080
described in section 2 of rfc 8754

717
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,320
next slide please

718
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,480
and

719
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,760
when being

720
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
decomposed in

721
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,480
in ipfix we have the ipv6 srh

722
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,120
segments left basically describing at

723
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,559
which point

724
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,120
uh we are in the

725
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,960
in the segment list

726
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,399
while the ipv6 srh tech and

727
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:51,200
sfvsh flex basically exposing the text

728
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,919
and the flex from the srh header

729
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,760
and uh the ipv6 srh segment type

730
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,840
basically describes which routing

731
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,519
protocol

732
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,120
that the city is coming from

733
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,000
next slide please

734
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,600
the

735
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,760
ipv6 srh section is basically exposing

736
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,399
the entire srh

737
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,519
in a series of n octets

738
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,600
while the ipvx

739
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,039
srh segment list section is actually

740
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,519
doing the same thing but only for the

741
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,240
the segment list itself

742
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,919
uh we have also ipv6 srh segment and

743
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,120
segment basic list which is basically

744
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,880
exposing

745
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,880
the srh

746
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,679
seat list as an

747
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,799
ordered basic list

748
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,679
next slide please

749
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,240
so there is uh two ways how we are able

750
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,960
to expose the the the seat list either

751
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,080
as a

752
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,360
as a basic list as all the basic list or

753
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,880
as an entire

754
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,480
list section

755
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,279
uh we had some feedback from the mailing

756
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,960
list so depending on implementation

757
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,000
one could be more easily implemented as

758
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,760
the others and the difference is

759
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,039
basically

760
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,840
where the decomposition is done either

761
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,039
on the export or on the data collection

762
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,360
side

763
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,720
next slide please

764
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,399
there is some

765
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,320
some operational considerations

766
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,120
regarding the compressed seed container

767
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,440
so currently at the spring

768
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,960
working group the srh compression

769
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,279
is being discussed

770
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,039
so in context of ipfix

771
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,600
basically it has no direct impact

772
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,200
because the

773
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,480
c uh the the cc container is still a

774
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,919
128 bit long uh ipv6 address

775
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,560
but uh it contains basically multiple uh

776
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,159
seats in uh in a cc container

777
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,520
and they are mutually exclusive

778
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,480
uh it probably makes sense that we are

779
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,879
adding in the draft document an

780
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,679
operational consideration consideration

781
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,719
section to describe what needs to be

782
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,520
done on the iphix data collection site

783
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,119
to distinguish between an ipv6 sheet and

784
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,679
sees it container

785
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,639
uh

786
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,760
from what we as authors understood it

787
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,918
most likely doesn't bring much added

788
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,280
value if we are actually decomposing the

789
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
decisive container

790
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,480
in the compressed sit but here i request

791
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,320
feedback from the mailing list

792
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,359
next slide please

793
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,760
so the current draft status we already

794
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,880
received feedback from spring ops awg

795
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,760
and the ipfix doctor

796
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,520
for the feedback

797
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,400
we

798
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,800
introduced the ipv6 srh section and soh

799
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,839
section segment list

800
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,880
section uh

801
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,839
and

802
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,240
we added the ipv6 sfh segments left

803
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,640
so that we can express at which position

804
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,160
of the segment list

805
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,000
uh the forwarding is happening and

806
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,960
that's

807
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,240
useful for detecting forwarding loops

808
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,480
uh we updated the operational

809
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,119
conservative consideration section

810
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,280
to describe the difference between the

811
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,400
ipv6 srh section and the

812
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,520
srh segment list section uh in which

813
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,640
case which one makes more sense

814
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,359
and we over updated the iana

815
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,440
consideration section to be in line with

816
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,880
rfc 8126

817
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,359
the document doesn't introduce any new

818
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,839
protocols it's for documentation

819
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,599
purposes however

820
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,320
because new ibfx registry have been

821
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,839
introduced we specify the document as

822
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,400
internet standard to be in line with

823
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,599
other documents

824
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,160
next slide please

825
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,640
uh next step uh

826
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,879
so

827
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,760
do you recognize the problem statement

828
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,240
that data plane visibility is missing in

829
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,839
srv6

830
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,400
we as authors believe that this document

831
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,480
should progress quickly through itf to

832
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,280
void that private enterprise code points

833
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,440
are being used for srv

834
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,760
six deployments and therefore we would

835
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,560
like to call for adoption at ops awg

836
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,480
that's all from my side

837
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,160
any questions

838
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,160
comments

839
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,440
uh elliott

840
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,599
hi thomas

841
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,640
thomas

842
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
um

843
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,240
just uh

844
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,240
speaker is

845
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,079
if you want to try again elliot

846
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,320
yeah

847
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,040
my question was uh just you know people

848
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,520
who are implementing

849
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,960
can you repeat the question again

850
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,280
yeah

851
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,200
it i asked

852
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,560
do you know of any implementations yet

853
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,460
uh not yet we are

[Music]

855
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,280
we are aiming for having an

856
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,520
implementation in vpp

857
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,640
by itf 115

858
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,400
does that answer your question

859
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,680
yes thank you

860
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,919
yeah

861
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,880
okay thank you thomas

862
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,160
good thanks a lot

marisol

864
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,160
hello thank you cheers for

865
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,400
having the um

866
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,560
luxury to present here in itf first time

867
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,680
presenting live previous time we were

868
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,440
presenting

869
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,240
the mlmo a data model life cycle

870
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,720
management and operations the version 2

871
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,440
we are running actually version 4

872
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,599
which is uploaded already on the

873
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,079
data tracker

874
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,000
the authors we have been adding

875
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,480
developers who is also here

876
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,440
on the list of authors and

877
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,880
we can go to the next slide

878
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
i want to give an introduction on where

879
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,680
we left it in the previous

880
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,280
version we had been defining

881
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,880
several data sets

882
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
where they were looking more into the

883
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
assets assets if you remember the

884
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,960
definition and if you have been tracking

885
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,320
on the mlmo asset is referring to any

886
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,359
hardware software or virtual entity that

887
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,320
we could represent part of the

888
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,400
infrastructure infrastructure

889
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,599
running and we have not been adding any

890
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,599
new attributes as part of this new

891
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,240
version it is more on the flexibility

892
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,760
and the scalability that we have been

893
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,839
adding to the different young data

894
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,359
models modules

895
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,839
that we have been working on if we go to

896
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,640
the next slide please

897
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,319
if you can see and compare with the

898
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,839
previous version everything that is in

899
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,440
yellow is new

900
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,720
we have been

901
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,800
adding on this flexibility

902
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,440
and consistency on the structure where

903
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,400
we have been defining instances

904
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,800
and every one of the modules that we

905
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,880
were defining in previous version is

906
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,640
called an instance

907
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,880
now where they are called based on the

908
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,640
idf lmo module

909
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,119
we have

910
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,160
defined

911
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,280
those

912
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,119
jam modules based on the lmo and

913
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,119
the assets features

914
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,000
incident and licenses are part of it we

915
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,240
have been adding organization and lmo

916
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,040
users as well they were attributes as

917
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,880
part of the

918
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,280
licenses module and with this

919
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,520
flexibility that we are adding it could

920
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,119
be as well something taken by the

921
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,240
vendors as a specific implementation on

922
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,680
top of

923
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,359
the attributes that we are defining and

924
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,960
data sets

925
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,839
and

926
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,920
the flexibility that we are

927
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,200
talking to

928
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,640
is

929
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,040
adding a consistency how the structure

930
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,400
has been implemented on the young

931
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,359
modules

932
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,079
and we are playing with the augment of

933
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,720
the jump modules in order to

934
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,480
build more attributes on what we have

935
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
defined already

936
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,599
okay

937
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,839
if we go to the next slide um marisol

938
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,839
can you also just make sure that we got

939
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,839
people from remote systems your audio is

940
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,359
coming out

941
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,319
okay sorry no problem

942
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,200
perfect

943
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,000
and

944
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,200
in the way we reference one module

945
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,839
one young model to another we have been

946
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,839
um

947
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,160
including

948
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,440
the

949
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,079
on this structure how we call and how we

950
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,880
reference in previous version we were

951
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,359
defining assets and sub-assets as part

952
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,079
of a container same thing for licenses

953
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,319
and sub licenses features and sub

954
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,880
features here on this structure we

955
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,920
either adding and complimenting on how

956
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,480
we address different reference from one

957
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,359
to many in this case access to features

958
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,160
we can have uh many features in there

959
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,880
users to organization we have the

960
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,040
one-on-one relationship and this can be

961
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,280
very flexible on how it is

962
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,400
referenced with the new jam modules

963
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,720
if we go to the next slide

964
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,960
another example of what the extension we

965
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
have done with the flexibility and

966
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,960
consistency it is how we call

967
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,400
this combo

968
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,960
structure where we can reference

969
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,040
a previous instance in this case

970
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,000
licenses we can represent in a better

971
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,440
way that it was done before on the

972
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
on this example that you have here on

973
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,040
the licensing

974
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,520
on the next slide

975
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,640
for organizations here's an example but

976
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,240
it has it

977
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,079
it applies to the other

978
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,400
um

979
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,760
data sets as well we have this hierarchy

980
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,319
represented with a parent and child

981
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,319
structure and an organization you can

982
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,200
see clearly an example how to use it and

983
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,720
we can call organizations within

984
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,280
organizations as part of this hierarchy

985
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,240
structure and in the department on it

986
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,640
this is a an example of implementation

987
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,400
based on xml

988
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,240
it is not really important on the

989
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,319
content for it but you can see an asset

990
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,800
represented with different attributes

991
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,040
features are part of that assets and

992
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
licensing can be referenced as well

993
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,000
within that asset

994
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,960
our asks and next steps

995
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,760
we welcome and appreciate feedback

996
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,040
we have been

997
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,760
setting up these site meetings where we

998
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,920
have collaboration from huawei from

999
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,720
benue from telefonica as well from luis

1000
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,920
and we are open to get more feedback on

1001
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,839
it we have this

1002
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,280
meeting set up

1003
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,240
every two weeks we will be extending it

1004
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,480
to be every month just to make sure that

1005
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,800
the good work is addressed on the side

1006
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,720
meetings and

1007
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,960
as part of the next steps

1008
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,040
we understand and this has been

1009
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,599
discussed and we can ask the alias the

1010
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,480
actually the the working group here

1011
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,720
uh we have been discussing the licenses

1012
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,119
is a complex issue and we understand is

1013
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,680
a complex issue we are working to

1014
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,720
evaluate how to tackle licensing

1015
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,599
and

1016
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,319
we are working camilla specifically

1017
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,440
together with sweeta are addressing this

1018
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,119
licensing concept

1019
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,040
and we

1020
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,680
are addressing as well and for the next

1021
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,319
revision we have to really work on that

1022
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,000
how to iterate

1023
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,720
through the young modules going to more

1024
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,800
specifics on how we define the type of

1025
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,440
attributes going to the anoms

1026
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,160
against identities and also

1027
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,599
some of the

1028
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,599
attributes that are stuck tackled as

1029
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,920
mandatory and there are some specifics

1030
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,280
on how we define addresses as well as

1031
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,119
part of the assets but those are

1032
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,200
specifics that we can discuss

1033
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,480
further as well

1034
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,200
now we are open to questions

1035
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:27,920
and

1036
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,079
welcome your feedback on what has been

1037
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,079
done

1038
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,880
so um i spoke to you earlier about this

1039
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,319
and i just wanted to share some comments

1040
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,960
i've made to you here um i think this is

1041
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,480
a very interesting problem to be

1042
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,599
approaching

1043
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,680
and i think it has a lot of potential

1044
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,640
value the tricky things to solve is

1045
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,400
making sure it has both enough

1046
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,839
flexibility

1047
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,760
to be widely applicable to different

1048
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,319
vendors and things and at the same time

1049
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,200
having enough commonality that you can

1050
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,880
then um

1051
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,240
correlate that data together and make

1052
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,680
use of it it's not sort of too different

1053
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,200
so i think it's trying to solve those

1054
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,480
two problems together which is quite

1055
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,800
tricky but um it would be useful it can

1056
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,079
be solved

1057
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,839
now as to some practical suggestions for

1058
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,800
this for example i think that the open

1059
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,119
config platforms module is sort of

1060
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,319
trying to solve a similar problem in a

1061
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,839
very specific case it's not exactly the

1062
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,160
same and they've and the way that

1063
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,920
they've built their flexibility is to

1064
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,760
allow this sort of

1065
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,880
arbitrary

1066
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,760
parent child hierarchy to be set up and

1067
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,920
then flattened into a list and you have

1068
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,119
similar sorts of things with this sort

1069
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,480
of parent point or maybe children

1070
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,400
pointers so i think that's a good thing

1071
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,839
and then they're using identities to

1072
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,599
identify particular properties or sub

1073
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,920
properties and extending it that way so

1074
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,599
i think identities is probably better

1075
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,160
choice mostly than enumerations

1076
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,319
because it allows more flexibility

1077
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,240
i also think that

1078
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,599
trying to concentrate on the core

1079
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,599
subset of the functionality that is

1080
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,839
widely applicable would be a good

1081
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,480
starting point and then to try and build

1082
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,640
extra functionality honors augmentation

1083
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,400
young models or a separate draft might

1084
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,760
be a good way of

1085
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,920
trying to get a good common core that

1086
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,480
people can work on

1087
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,280
yes thank you rob i i think we as you

1088
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,280
mentioned before we were discussing on

1089
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,240
this it will be good to get the review

1090
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,760
on those specifics as well answering on

1091
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,079
the on the list just to make sure that

1092
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,800
we have a good review but agree agree

1093
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,480
with with all the comments

1094
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,839
and we could even

1095
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,720
reduce the modules just making sure that

1096
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,160
is common to more vendors right and this

1097
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,760
is kind of the exercise that we want to

1098
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,440
do on the iteration

1099
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,480
uh going forward i'm moving to call for

1100
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,280
adoption as well as soon as possible but

1101
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,640
yeah thank you for all the comments

1102
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,440
um bow

1103
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,359
can you hear me

1104
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,640
yeah

1105
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,319
yeah i have a

1106
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:14,880
clarification

1107
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,280
uh question on this so

1108
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,480
this model is the device model or

1109
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,359
like

1110
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,480
a

1111
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,200
noise bond interface model of like

1112
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,160
network controller

1113
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,359
so i didn't get the question her

1114
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,280
question was is this a device level

1115
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,520
model or a northbound interface model

1116
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,839
like on a controller

1117
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,480
we consider an asset to be as well a

1118
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,440
controller then it depends from where

1119
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,800
you look at it

1120
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,559
at the asset level

1121
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,559
right

1122
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,440
it is a representation of it could be a

1123
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,760
device physical or virtual or it could

1124
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,160
be even a controller right from a

1125
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,480
software point of view or even a service

1126
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,200
as well

1127
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,040
so this is not device model uh from your

1128
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,558
it's not a specific explanation

1129
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,800
okay thank you

1130
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,520
then

1131
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,640
one last comment

1132
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,760
so bernoullis so i want to address two

1133
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,880
points uh so first of all the inventory

1134
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,440
because we've seen that it was discussed

1135
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,119
multiple times we even learned today

1136
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,000
that there's a c camp uh inventory model

1137
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,440
so there are multiple definitions of

1138
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,000
inventory uh there is like the uh the

1139
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,839
inventory like the entity map in the

1140
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,119
past and you got the young male for that

1141
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,680
there is like the inventory for what is

1142
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,400
in the end a platform or device

1143
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,160
so to make the link with what beau was

1144
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,400
mentioning there is like device but

1145
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,680
whether you see this on top of a

1146
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,680
controller they still need to have the

1147
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,240
same characteristic device it's like an

1148
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,599
id it's like a vendor it's like an os

1149
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,839
it's like a type and all this and we

1150
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,000
start to have this in many different

1151
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,720
places so that would be good to have the

1152
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,760
same

1153
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,200
consistency

1154
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,920
uh okay maybe i'm dreaming of a grouping

1155
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,599
a grouping where we've got the same the

1156
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,280
same thing in yang right but that's

1157
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,880
something we have to pay attention to to

1158
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,200
not redefine the same thing over and

1159
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,079
over

1160
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,160
that's one point and the second one is

1161
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,480
about licensing so you you mentioned i

1162
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,720
was attending the course yes and my main

1163
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,359
feedback was that licensing is

1164
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,400
very complex i understand what we want

1165
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,599
to do that makes a lot of sense

1166
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,680
for multiple use cases

1167
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,480
but all this has to be multi cross

1168
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,000
vendor right that's why we are here to

1169
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,400
do standard and that will be

1170
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,359
very complex so my feedback in those

1171
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,200
calls were that

1172
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,119
maybe where

1173
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,079
this is too complex

1174
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,079
right

1175
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,079
and we have also addressed uh on that

1176
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,680
question or comment it is complex we

1177
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,640
want to

1178
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,720
see how far we could get on the use

1179
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,440
cases that we are operating and we are

1180
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,599
working on that and

1181
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,359
camilo and sweeta are the main people

1182
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,200
looking at that at the moment and we

1183
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,240
will be

1184
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,240
following up on the side meetings from

1185
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,280
that

1186
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,520
on the inventory we have been also

1187
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,680
discussed previously to this meeting on

1188
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,280
how to address that

1189
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,640
i

1190
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,040
would say that it's not a use case

1191
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,880
specifically from this dml mmo

1192
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,880
having inventory but we have to define

1193
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,040
somehow those entities that we are

1194
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,000
addressing what we call assets and there

1195
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,480
are some attributes already defined if

1196
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,680
the working group decide to go to an

1197
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,359
inventory

1198
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,760
approach we will be helping and

1199
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,440
supporting on that idea as well

1200
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,760
uh thanks marcel i ran a poll uh while

1201
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,839
you were talking uh of the participants

1202
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,920
20 uh decided to either raise or not

1203
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,599
raise their hand there were 14 in

1204
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,480
support of the work and i was curious as

1205
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,800
chair you're not asking for adoption but

1206
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,400
there does seem to be a lot of people

1207
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,760
working on this

1208
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,599
so i i think we do have to address some

1209
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,280
of the questions that that have been

1210
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,040
raised and see

1211
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,880
how we want to proceed

1212
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,800
but in

1213
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,160
interest of time i think we should

1214
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,920
probably have this conversation on the

1215
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,040
list

1216
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,480
and move forward but i appreciate you

1217
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,960
coming and presenting

1218
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,119
next up we have ken

1219
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,680
who i saw you online

1220
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,079
yes thank you

1221
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,640
and uh this is a already adopted work

1222
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,720
item i asked to go a little bit later

1223
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,400
because i had a conflicting meeting

1224
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,440
earlier

1225
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,480
so uh yeah just an overview

1226
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,599
as we are looking to update the tls

1227
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,040
transport model of snmp v3

1228
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,839
so next slide

1229
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,160
so the effort was approved after ietf112

1230
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,599
we've updated the fingerprint algorithm

1231
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,240
the big challenge there is that the

1232
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,599
existing algorithm references tls 1.2

1233
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,880
hashing table

1234
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,559
that hashing table will no longer be

1235
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,640
maintained now that they've migrated to

1236
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,200
1.3

1237
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,400
and that

1238
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,839
that's a hash of the x.509 cert

1239
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:30,559
the

1240
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,440
um

1241
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,280
we've received comments we've addressed

1242
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,200
all of those comments we've posted a new

1243
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,880
draft

1244
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,240
so i think we've resolved everything now

1245
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,960
and if you go on next slide the big

1246
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,160
change

1247
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,680
uh is that we figured out how to handle

1248
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,280
this hashing table

1249
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,160
um

1250
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,079
initially we thought thought about the

1251
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,680
concept for replacing the fingerprint

1252
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,880
algorithm

1253
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,720
that results in changing all of the mid

1254
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,480
op objects

1255
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,520
and uses the new identifier table that's

1256
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,920
a major overhaul to the nib so we wanted

1257
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,240
to avoid that

1258
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,640
the second option was to

1259
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,599
maintain using the 1.2 hashing algorithm

1260
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:12,559
table

1261
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,880
we talked to the

1262
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,760
people

1263
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,839
that are in charge of that table they

1264
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,680
did not want to continue maintenance

1265
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,920
that table because that would imply any

1266
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,200
new hashing algorithm could be used with

1267
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
tls 1.2

1268
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,760
so they wanted to avoid that

1269
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,119
the good news

1270
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,839
is that we determined that we could

1271
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,040
actually just revise the definition of

1272
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,200
our fingerprint algorithm

1273
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,480
to use

1274
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,200
a duplicated table if you will so take

1275
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,319
the tls 1.2 table as it exists today

1276
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,880
that is not going to change

1277
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,960
copy that to a new table

1278
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,880
revise the definition of our fingerprint

1279
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,440
algorithm to point to this new table and

1280
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,520
now we can extend that table as we need

1281
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,680
to

1282
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,319
the only question has been whether or

1283
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,720
not this would constitute a normative

1284
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,839
change to

1285
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,760
uh ken we lost you if you can still hear

1286
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,760
us

1287
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,880
it seemed to have timed out for some

1288
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,440
reason and

1289
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,079
flipped me on mute um

1290
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,920
okay so uh

1291
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,680
um

1292
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,280
the uh

1293
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,079
bit but we determined by consulting with

1294
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,079
nib experts that we would be able to

1295
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,559
make this change without having to go

1296
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,400
back and revise all of our table

1297
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,160
structure within the nip

1298
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,359
so this is a fairly easy fix and that is

1299
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,319
what the most recent draft reflects

1300
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,880
next slide

1301
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,720
uh there were some other items uh that

1302
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,440
we've updated compared to the current

1303
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,960
rfc

1304
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,559
we've clarified that authentication and

1305
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,040
privacy are always provided that's just

1306
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,319
the natural part of tls 1.3

1307
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,960
we remind your readers of the updates in

1308
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,480
8996

1309
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,040
which prohibits tls versions prior to

1310
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,880
1.2

1311
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,440
we are prohibiting the use of the zero

1312
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,119
rtt feature

1313
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,760
of 1.3

1314
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,000
clarifying tls compliance requirements

1315
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,440
and updating

1316
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,760
uh we made some minor edits to

1317
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,760
capitalize some keywords

1318
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,480
uh to be conformant with bs

1319
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,400
bcp14

1320
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,200
uh we also changed a couple of instances

1321
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,760
of may not with must not

1322
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,920
to be a little bit clearer

1323
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,880
and next slide

1324
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,920
so uh there are some edits that i've

1325
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,760
discovered uh

1326
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,000
since the last draft that will be in an

1327
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,040
upcoming draft shortly

1328
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,880
the first item is

1329
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,880
really given that this is just a simple

1330
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,040
update at this point we should probably

1331
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,160
revise the name of the rfc or the

1332
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,280
of the work

1333
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,960
to be updates to the tlstm rather than

1334
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,760
specifically citing version 1.3 of tls

1335
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,079
we should remove the double quotes that

1336
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,440
are within the description clause of s

1337
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,839
mp tls fingerprint

1338
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,839
just some other nets removing references

1339
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,680
that are not used in this document

1340
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,160
removing the appendix examples because

1341
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,480
they're just identical to the existing

1342
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,720
rfc

1343
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,839
and

1344
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,559
the the final change or a question i

1345
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,079
have i think

1346
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,640
is whether we should change the name of

1347
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,400
the proposed table

1348
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,160
so as i mentioned

1349
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,280
we are duplicating the existing tls hash

1350
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,280
algorithm table

1351
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,960
to create our own

1352
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,680
that is currently called snmp tls

1353
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,118
fingerprint algorithm table

1354
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,319
my thought is this might be a useful

1355
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:07,599
registry for other efforts within ietf

1356
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,599
so perhaps we should have a more general

1357
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,760
name such as infm multiversion tls hash

1358
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,799
algorithm registry

1359
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,680
justified

1360
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,799
next slide

1361
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,359
uh so that's pretty much where we are i

1362
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:30,160
think with those final edits we should

1363
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,599
be pretty close

1364
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,680
we will send it out for a final review

1365
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,680
and comment and then we can start the

1366
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,400
last call process i think

1367
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,920
um

1368
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,599
and we will also make sure we distribute

1369
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,160
this to the tls reflectors as well

1370
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,440
since it can impact them

1371
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,960
any questions

1372
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,880
okay i'm going to i'm going to draw a

1373
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,520
line in the sand oh sorry

1374
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,160
you just beat me

1375
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,480
without hats so sorry no had no chair

1376
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,760
head on um so i guess that also uh in in

1377
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,119
cozy

1378
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,520
uh they're working on uh uh hashing

1379
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,720
algorithm

1380
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,400
um index

1381
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,680
it's probably

1382
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,799
uh worth a look

1383
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
they want to do that so if if there's

1384
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,799
overlap just swing

1385
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,440
just make sure that the indices are

1386
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,359
equivalent i think that's the most

1387
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,480
important thing

1388
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,240
um i think the tls might have a

1389
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,200
different

1390
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,280
subset than the thing

1391
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,680
cozy wants to do but again there are

1392
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,200
indices in there today so if three would

1393
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,280
mean the same three the confusion would

1394
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,480
be way less

1395
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,240
so i think that would be interesting to

1396
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,680
think that's just from my side

1397
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,240
i was gonna say something maybe similar

1398
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,920
um

1399
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,960
as a contributor i i honestly i feel my

1400
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,440
gut my initial reaction was

1401
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,240
it might want to stay snmp is the name

1402
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,480
of the registry just because

1403
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,839
of what we ran into with tls where

1404
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,760
if if it does cause some sort of

1405
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,760
semantic change down the road if others

1406
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,920
want to add things to it that essent

1407
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,359
that this wouldn't support um but uh

1408
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,680
hank brings up a good point if there are

1409
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,240
overlap that that aligns maybe then that

1410
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,240
that can help inform your decision can

1411
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,280
okay

1412
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,720
uh i

1413
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,839
i think we would want to avoid

1414
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,520
any changes to the existing tls 1.2

1415
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,880
table

1416
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,480
uh

1417
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,799
any reassignment of those numbers

1418
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,040
on a simple basis that if we did it

1419
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,440
would break backwards credibility

1420
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,319
um

1421
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:46,880
but but but any if there are additional

1422
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
items that aren't in that table yet we

1423
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,760
can certainly add those

1424
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,760
yep absolutely don't want to change and

1425
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,720
rob is in the queue

1426
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,720
just to sort of i've not read this

1427
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,119
latest version of the draft so um my one

1428
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,240
question is and you may already cover

1429
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,880
this is if new items were added into the

1430
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,480
existing tls 1.2 io registry what

1431
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,319
process would be involved to make sure

1432
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:13,200
they also updated into this new registry

1433
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,559
is that some of the draft should have

1434
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:17,040
some text to update how

1435
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,119
that is processed to make sure they're

1436
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,720
copied here and that that doesn't have

1437
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,079
to be done as like a separate manual

1438
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,079
step

1439
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,160
does my question make sense

1440
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,960
i it i think so i think it's just uh how

1441
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,319
do we

1442
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,760
add a reg a new registered item

1443
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,559
uh i would assume that ayanna has formal

1444
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,119
processes for that i'm not sure

1445
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,200
that we need anything in our text but

1446
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,119
i'm happy to just

1447
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,880
happen to hear your comments so i think

1448
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,799
my question is more about and again my

1449
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,799
misunderstandings but is this this

1450
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,400
recipe is meant to be a superset of the

1451
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,680
tls 1.2 and 1.3 is that correct

1452
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,359
yes so so i think

1453
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,839
i kind of shepherded some of these

1454
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,319
questions to the tls alias

1455
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,200
um

1456
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,680
my understanding is they do not want to

1457
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,119
add any

1458
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,400
additional entries to this because tls12

1459
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,319
which is all that the original registry

1460
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:14,559
covers is not going to add any more

1461
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,079
protocol and apps are any more

1462
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,400
algorithms

1463
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,119
so adding 1.3 algorithms to here with a

1464
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,000
one byte uh registry value

1465
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,680
would uh

1466
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,240
imply that they work with tls 1.2 when

1467
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,200
they don't

1468
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,240
my under again my understanding

1469
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,319
is that there will not be any more

1470
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,280
additions to this registry and that is

1471
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,160
why um they recommended we

1472
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,520
fork our own

1473
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,520
okay so i'll phrase my questions like

1474
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,760
different ways if this is an snnp

1475
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,599
specific registry

1476
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,839
then it'll pick up some default values

1477
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,520
to start off with

1478
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,359
how does it need to make sure that if

1479
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,599
there's new entries added to tls1.3 they

1480
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,240
also get updated into this snmp registry

1481
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,160
and if so we want to make sure there's

1482
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,599
text to make sure that happens

1483
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,039
automatically

1484
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,799
and not having to be a manual step

1485
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,559
that's the thing i'm trying to get it no

1486
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,119
that's a good point yeah

1487
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,160
yep good point

1488
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,039
uh yeah elliott uh quick comment

1489
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:17,920
um

1490
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,240
yes uh just a question what is the

1491
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,440
registry policy for tls 1.2 for the tls

1492
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,880
102 registry in question

1493
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,280
uh it's an expert review um

1494
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,559
okay so

1495
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,400
what they're saying is are they shutting

1496
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,359
down

1497
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,440
so somebody should take an action if

1498
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,960
they think that this is going to be a

1499
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,319
problem like

1500
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:41,760
they should take a standards action to

1501
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,400
shut down new entries otherwise

1502
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,400
you know it's up to the experts right

1503
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,319
and

1504
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,880
the the experts are meant to be guided

1505
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,839
by

1506
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,920
you know whatever their

1507
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,359
their best knowledge is so

1508
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,280
it doesn't sound like you can absolutely

1509
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,960
affirmatively say that there will be no

1510
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,599
new entries

1511
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,160
that's fair point

1512
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,319
[Music]

1513
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:11,200
again i was going off the what the

1514
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,000
those experts replied to us with

1515
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,240
but that that is a fair point

1516
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,119
um

1517
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,280
and in that case the text would probably

1518
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,720
need to cover

1519
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,280
the addition to either the tls 1 2 or 1

1520
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,920
3 and registries

1521
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,880
thanks ken

1522
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,039
thank you

01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,559
all right so i want to present a draft

1525
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,319
which is about data manifest for

1526
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,559
streaming telemetry we changed the title

1527
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,119
we improved it thanks matt for that this

1528
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,240
is actually data manifest for

1529
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,799
contextualized

1530
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:03,359
streaming data

1531
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:06,079
and we posted a version two this week

1532
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:07,839
with a couple of updates so let me go to

1533
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,319
the next slides

1534
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,839
i want to make sure that you understand

1535
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,520
why we need this

1536
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,119
so the idea is not to expose new young

1537
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,319
objects

1538
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,480
but the rather to define

1539
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,440
what we need to keep as metadata

1540
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,760
what we call a data manifest as contact

1541
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,960
information

1542
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,039
to make sure the data could still be

1543
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,280
interpreted

1544
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,960
if the device is not accessible any

1545
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,559
longer

1546
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,799
or the device being updated

1547
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,280
or as new configuration

1548
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,079
the end goal is that from let's say a

1549
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,839
data collection point of view a big data

1550
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,079
lake we want to make sure that we could

1551
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,240
do the under my detection and the

1552
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,559
enclosed loop

1553
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,640
so on one side we have the product

1554
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,960
capabilities which mean that i could

1555
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,000
tell if a specific yang object supported

1556
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,920
unchanged or not

1557
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,480
though so i could configure it but what

1558
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,640
we don't have is

1559
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,960
that i don't know or it was actually

1560
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,319
metered

1561
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:09,200
right

1562
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,039
and under which circumstances

1563
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,720
specifically whenever the device is not

1564
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,640
there any longer so on the next slide

1565
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,640
let's take an example

1566
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,480
we see this from a data collection

1567
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,920
vantage point

1568
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,680
on the left we've got

1569
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,200
time one

1570
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,000
with a counter which is value is 42 it's

1571
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,520
always 42 right

1572
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,760
and the status is up

1573
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,240
now i'm in time which is now

1574
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,319
and there are no updates

1575
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,079
and i see this from a pure data

1576
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,839
collection point of view so what's

1577
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,760
happening well there is

1578
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,240
a problem because my telemetry has an

1579
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,559
issue or there is a bug

1580
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,839
or the sender the router is overloaded

1581
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,680
so can't send anything

1582
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,480
or

1583
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,160
there is no problem because there is

1584
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,240
just a long cadence

1585
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,839
in my telemetry

1586
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,039
or there is no problem because it's

1587
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,119
unchanged it has not changed

1588
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,680
or maybe there is this feature in my

1589
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,599
company which is super redundancy which

1590
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,400
means

1591
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,480
if they haven't changed don't say it to

1592
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,680
me

1593
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,240
and i've got no way to know this from a

1594
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,640
pure data collection point of view

1595
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,119
right so i will be i might be drawing

1596
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,680
the wrong conclusion in terms of anomaly

1597
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,079
and the connection this is the entire

1598
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,680
point here so on the next slide

1599
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,039
we want to propose data manifest so

1600
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,520
basically context information

1601
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,280
and there are two of them the first one

1602
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,680
is the platform manifest right

1603
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,839
characterizes the platform producing the

1604
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,000
data and you see it could be perceived

1605
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,599
as inventory this was the camera was

1606
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,119
making before

1607
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,000
the source router the source device

1608
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,920
and the other one is like the data

1609
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,920
collection manifest

1610
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,720
characterizes how and when the telemetry

1611
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,640
was metered

1612
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,760
okay

1613
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,799
the principles here is that whenever you

1614
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:01,359
stream telemetry

1615
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,920
this contact information must follow the

1616
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,680
data

1617
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,799
right

1618
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,480
and if the data are moved to a different

1619
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,760
place there still must follow the data

1620
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,240
because without the context we have data

1621
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,399
and we can't take much information about

1622
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:19,439
it much actions about it sorry

1623
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:21,919
next slide

1624
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:26,080
so that's the typical p yang tree and uh

1625
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,679
we've been adding at the top like the

1626
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:28,799
vendor

1627
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,040
and by the way we added a nacio from the

1628
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,120
madrid university as an author this was

1629
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,960
his feedback and this is aligned with

1630
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,759
the

1631
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,759
again the platform information coming

1632
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,158
from the young catalog because we always

1633
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:44,158
deal with the same type of tuples right

1634
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:46,319
we also included the the full yang

1635
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,080
library to get information about the

1636
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,080
data store

1637
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,399
we corrected a small mistake that this

1638
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,319
young module was read right no it's not

1639
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,238
it's only read-only

1640
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,679
along with the data you've got this

1641
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:59,279
contact information you're not supposed

1642
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,520
to change it it's from the source right

1643
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,600
and the package sets

1644
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,719
so on the next slide

1645
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,880
this is information about the data

1646
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,799
collection manifest right we're telling

1647
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:16,880
like well per subscription id

1648
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,759
well

1649
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,198
what is the

1650
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:22,080
requested period the actual period the

1651
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,520
unchain yes or no su presidency

1652
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,799
and we added also from widget.com there

1653
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,600
are some potential interesting use cases

1654
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,479
there

1655
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,158
comparing what is in intended or

1656
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,799
candidates

1657
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,080
on the next slide

1658
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,719
we could ask ourselves how frequently do

1659
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,439
you do we update those two manifests the

1660
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,839
platform one it's only one ever get a

1661
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:50,080
platform change typically a reboot chain

1662
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,679
of os okay so not very frequently

1663
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,320
now for a data collection one we update

1664
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,000
it whenever the collection condition

1665
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,040
changed typically i change the cadence

1666
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,120
i've got the new subscription

1667
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,600
orders the correction third is adjusted

1668
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,199
based on cpu

1669
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,120
all right

1670
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,840
on the next slide

1671
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,400
we're thinking well we should be using

1672
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,320
telemetry information well that makes

1673
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,159
sense because it's a information about

1674
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,640
telemetry and that should follow with

1675
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,880
telemetry and we could be using the

1676
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,800
unchanged so that we would make sure

1677
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,960
that if some information about the

1678
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,040
context changes

1679
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,920
then we would reliably receive it and

1680
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,760
automatically and directly receive it

1681
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:40,400
okay so let me go to the next slide

1682
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,159
let me just say on this one that you

1683
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,640
actually in a draft how to map the data

1684
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,560
to the data manifest

1685
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,920
let's keep that one and go to the next

1686
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,159
one

1687
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,800
so we identified a couple of uh

1688
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,800
improvements right and that's where if

1689
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,880
you want go to the mic at the end and

1690
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,760
discuss this well one of them was about

1691
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,080
uh the source of data

1692
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,040
and the self-assertiveness

1693
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,120
how do i know that actually if you are a

1694
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,199
vnf or router well

1695
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,360
can i trust you right and there's also

1696
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,440
the issue of data integrity what if

1697
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,760
someone would change this information

1698
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,600
now what we need to do here is actually

1699
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,760
analyze the threat model

1700
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,920
right which is basically management

1701
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,480
traffic inside your domain

1702
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,800
but we have any way to do it

1703
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,000
right

1704
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,280
personally i always believe

1705
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,800
pragmatically that if someone is

1706
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,360
changing just this source of data he's

1707
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,440
able to attack you on the front maybe

1708
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,960
you have bigger problem than just

1709
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,840
changing the contact

1710
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,600
information but you know we'll have to

1711
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,440
pass security 80s at some point in time

1712
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,080
so let's analyze the third model

1713
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,600
open questions

1714
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,560
uh

1715
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,320
well we could do that for other types of

1716
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,440
information

1717
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,640
the context right for snmp

1718
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,199
for ip fix well ipfx if you do sampling

1719
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,719
you want to know you're doing something

1720
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,560
to the same complex information type

1721
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,719
same type

1722
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,880
what about virtual devices

1723
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,840
what about vnfs

1724
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,640
right

1725
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,800
do we want to mention if there is missed

1726
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,640
collections

1727
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,400
that's also something pretty interesting

1728
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,080
to understand from a data collection

1729
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,320
point of view

1730
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,159
and what about the yank packages which

1731
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,960
is a topic in the the ops area that

1732
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,239
could potentially be included

1733
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,560
and i believe this is no maybe one more

1734
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,600
slide

1735
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,880
yeah

1736
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,640
so the conclusion got a couple of good

1737
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,199
feedback meteria nacio

1738
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:38,000
and i would like to understand from this

1739
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,360
working group if you recognize the issue

1740
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,320
and if you believe that we should work

1741
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,440
on this

1742
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,880
from an author point of view from

1743
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,880
different horizon we clearly believe

1744
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,800
this is a problem to be solved

1745
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,400
because we want to solve the issue of

1746
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,920
autonomous networks

1747
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,000
for which we must have closed loop for

1748
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,199
which you must have another detection

1749
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,480
thank you

1750
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,640
rob

1751
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,640
yeah rob is a participant uh thanks ben

1752
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,520
well

1753
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,760
i think to recognize the problem so

1754
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,400
absolutely um i definitely think this is

1755
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,520
a very interesting problem i think it's

1756
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,600
very hard one to solve and i think one

1757
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,360
of the key questions it looks like you

1758
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,920
are returning the metadata per

1759
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,320
subscription is that correct which i

1760
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,679
understand why you're doing that because

1761
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:23,920
otherwise it's going to be too much data

1762
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,760
but i wonder actually whether to really

1763
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,159
solve this you almost need the metadata

1764
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:29,360
per

1765
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,199
leaf field that's being pushed off the

1766
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,400
box because

1767
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,159
if for example

1768
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,679
you've got a subscription an interest

1769
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:37,600
goes away and it stops returning data

1770
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,840
that interface i'm not sure whether you

1771
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,640
would spot that but if you do it per

1772
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,719
the leaf node then you end up with too

1773
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,480
much data so i think it's an interesting

1774
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,320
problem to solve

1775
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,360
i don't know what the solution is so i i

1776
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,920
don't think it's good to work on it

1777
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,840
but i think it's tricky

1778
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,679
it's tricky there was an mrg like a

1779
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:59,679
comment about digital twin

1780
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,000
right and the gentleman there

1781
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
mentioned that somehow we start to be in

1782
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,040
the world of uh

1783
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,640
data

1784
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,040
oh forget it now

1785
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,760
data driven ai which is actually trying

1786
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,840
to find out because all it is sometimes

1787
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,760
they want to have all the data right we

1788
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,120
have to be slightly pragmatic

1789
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,280
specifically whenever we speak operators

1790
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,679
so this is trying to find out

1791
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,159
how much data do we need at the minimum

1792
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,640
to be able to solve the problem ideally

1793
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,159
everything per node

1794
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,320
all the time every single flow data

1795
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,600
plane

1796
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,239
in practice there is like

1797
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:37,360
uh

1798
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,600
middle ground so i agree with you with

1799
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,920
your statement and with the subscription

1800
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,600
id we could find that find out which

1801
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,000
notes are in there and that's a

1802
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,120
compromise

1803
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,840
but but in terms of wanting to know

1804
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,840
um both when a value was was actually

1805
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,760
written and how fresh it is those two

1806
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,320
properties i think are important so

1807
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,920
i think that is i think it's interesting

1808
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,239
problem

1809
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,679
so hi this is hank again uh

1810
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:14,719
with no heads on so um so your

1811
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,080
this manifests how i understand it is

1812
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,280
um combining quite a few of um different

1813
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,040
types of information so it's all from

1814
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,640
the subscription

1815
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,800
side so the subscription also deals with

1816
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,159
the same problem at the beginning you

1817
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,400
sell everything whatever you subscribe

1818
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,239
to you don't know what the receiver

1819
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,640
knows so you get a full iframe so to

1820
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,640
speak and that's the same with metadata

1821
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,640
you would give the full meta that i want

1822
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,960
but that can be slimmed down later and

1823
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,600
then outside of the subscription context

1824
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,480
as

1825
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,120
uh like uh integrity i heard and when i

1826
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,920
hear integrity sometimes i always always

1827
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,000
think remote attestation trustworthiness

1828
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
so i might have some

1829
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,920
future comments on that because i think

1830
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,400
that's also metadata that will change

1831
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,480
because especially if the identity of

1832
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,320
the composite system changes due to

1833
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,480
vital elements changing and then for its

1834
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,000
expressiveness and trustworthiness

1835
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,640
changes although the data and the leaves

1836
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,880
will remain the same so i think yes it

1837
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,440
sounds to me like an interesting problem

1838
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,759
thank you

1839
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,440
i'm sorry diego we're going to have to

1840
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,040
cut it off

1841
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:23,840
okay

1842
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,000
no no it's just what just say that uh

1843
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,280
developers developers yes thank you

1844
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,080
no it's precisely this we we are right

1845
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,760
now very much

1846
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,040
involved in

1847
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,960
projects that are related to this too

1848
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,360
not the data the metadata because we are

1849
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,360
right now when you analyze how the

1850
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,000
network is behaving we are

1851
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,199
feeling the deluge and we need

1852
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,960
and this this kind of initiative is

1853
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,040
something that is of extremely extreme

1854
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,040
interest to us just to

1855
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,040
as a as a node

1856
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,120
thank you

1857
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,280
thank you

1858
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,880
oh oh okay

1859
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,080
that's great

1860
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,640
okay um i thank you

1861
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,880
um so i'm misha wang from china

1862
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,760
chinamobile so i will present this work

1863
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,320
uh in-band flow learning framework

1864
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,920
also on behalf of uh louie and friend

1865
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:28,719
the courses so okay next slide please

1866
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:31,520
um so the network telemetry is uh

1867
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,719
provides a network visibility and tools

1868
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,280
to the state and behavior of a

1869
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,560
network so it is a crucial to

1870
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,080
network operations and load supervisions

1871
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,679
so from our

1872
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,760
operator's perspective

1873
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,719
it is important to monitor the live

1874
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,920
traffic

1875
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,920
including the delay and

1876
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,360
packet loss

1877
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,159
and

1878
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:59,520
previously we have presented

1879
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,320
the problem statement of the event flow

1880
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,159
telemetry deployment

1881
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,960
on the last itf committee

1882
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,040
so

1883
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,280
just mention that we really

1884
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,320
have a large scale of um

1885
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,760
5g backhaul networks like um like

1886
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,440
uh 40

1887
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:24,080
400 000 network nodes and um already

1888
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,040
have

1889
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,239
um fifty hundred thousand um

1890
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,239
base stations so

1891
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,080
so this um

1892
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,000
issue is really um

1893
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,320
important issue in our large-scale

1894
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,440
network

1895
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,520
and in this draft we are going to

1896
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,040
propose um

1897
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,040
a framework of the indent and flow based

1898
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,840
information learning mechanism to try to

1899
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,400
solve the problems in our deployment of

1900
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,679
the television

1901
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:53,520
okay um

1902
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,760
next piece

1903
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,400
also first the framework of the in-band

1904
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,679
flow learning

1905
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,719
includes three components of

1906
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:05,280
service discovery and telemetry

1907
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,480
deployment

1908
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,760
and telemetry adjustments

1909
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,400
so for each components there's many

1910
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,520
functions

1911
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,320
i like in service discovery um the main

1912
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,840
function is

1913
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,600
to do flow characteristic acquisitions

1914
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,159
and in commentary deployment the main

1915
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,400
functions are

1916
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,600
to figure the telemetry type policy and

1917
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,800
instance

1918
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,280
and for the adjustments um

1919
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:37,280
the most important function is for aging

1920
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,080
so

1921
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,600
um there are still methods to do uh

1922
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,440
those functions

1923
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,719
um

1924
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,800
so the differences between the methods

1925
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,360
we listed here

1926
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,640
and then the

1927
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,760
controller trigger or deploy

1928
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,560
all the device deploy or trigger and

1929
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,679
sometimes they work together to

1930
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:02,719
to complete a function

1931
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:07,040
so okay next please

1932
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,480
and here for the service discovery we

1933
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,760
consider is

1934
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,280
a process of

1935
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,000
sampling to the service flow which is

1936
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,400
being transmitted in the network

1937
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,120
and in order to further determine which

1938
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,280
flow should be monitored

1939
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,920
and depends on the characteristic of the

1940
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,440
service flow like

1941
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:31,360
ip source address ip destination address

1942
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,920
tcp udp port numbers

1943
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,440
vrf

1944
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,760
interface network nodes

1945
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,000
and also can be

1946
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,920
mac address or

1947
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,840
the combinations of these

1948
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,280
characteristics and to target the

1949
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,400
service discovery is to obtain these

1950
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,840
flow characteristics from the traffic

1951
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:54,719
and

1952
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,040
it can be configuration triggers

1953
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,280
you can based on the database of a

1954
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,000
planned service flow information

1955
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
which is stored on the central

1956
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,199
controller

1957
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:10,239
and uh we can obtain it from the network

1958
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:11,440
operations

1959
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:15,280
so um such as a table of services

1960
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,440
uh between the base station and co

1961
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,960
network equipment

1962
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,719
uh in our 5g backhoe scenario

1963
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,719
and we also can do

1964
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,880
device triggers

1965
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,360
like live traffic sampling

1966
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,679
and to relies on the capability of

1967
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,360
forwarding plane of a network node

1968
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,559
okay next piece

1969
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,880
the parametric deployment um

1970
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,000
functions are type policy and deployment

1971
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,440
so first type we should um consider is

1972
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,880
end-to-end type or hope i hope type for

1973
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,639
end-to-end um

1974
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:55,679
you can

1975
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:56,400
just

1976
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,120
got uh the report from the

1977
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,400
endpoint and uh egress node and for

1978
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,960
hobart hub um each node on the path

1979
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,520
should report the

1980
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,639
um performance monitoring yeah

1981
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,120
and for the telemetry policy is to

1982
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,760
determine which flow should be monitored

1983
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,560
um

1984
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,040
it can be um a lot

1985
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,159
a lot of strategies and policies um i

1986
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:25,199
just put an example like we do in the

1987
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,360
base station or mainly

1988
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,920
based on ip and port

1989
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:30,960
yeah

1990
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,960
and for the deployment it can be

1991
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,520
deployed by the controller or it can be

1992
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,199
deployed by the device itself

1993
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:40,000
so

1994
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,040
okay next please

1995
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:45,199
and for

1996
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:48,080
adjustment there's two scenarios um

1997
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,320
first is the route convergency

1998
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,480
so when the service flow

1999
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,440
uh switch to the other forwarding nodes

2000
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,040
um

2001
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,440
like in some protection or

2002
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,880
rock commodity

2003
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,080
scenario

2004
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,880
uh to monitor the same flow information

2005
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,760
a new telemetry instance is required to

2006
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,040
add on the new transit or e-grass node

2007
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:15,199
depending on the service telemetry type

2008
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,960
and for aging so regarding um iv or

2009
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,719
event or

2010
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,199
a performance monitoring running on the

2011
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,639
fourth pass

2012
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:28,000
or there is no flow that that meets the

2013
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,120
policy

2014
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,400
uh

2015
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,760
during

2016
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,360
a period so the aging of

2017
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,960
of the iv or

2018
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,440
in band performance mandatory should be

2019
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,320
supported in order to recycle

2020
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,199
the network resources

2021
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,520
and the instance should be delete or

2022
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,840
once it becomes still

2023
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,159
so it can be controlled by the central

2024
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,639
controller or um the network can do

2025
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,120
itself

2026
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,040
oh okay i think

2027
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,760
we can

2028
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,239
um so for the next step

2029
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,360
uh we will update the draft according to

2030
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,159
the feedbacks and we are

2031
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,159
warmly welcome any comments or

2032
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,120
contributions to this one

2033
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,280
okay um

2034
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,239
that's all thank you

2035
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,639
uh good evening uh thank you for your

2036
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,480
draft um

2037
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,760
the i i have to say in your presentation

2038
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,440
it was just a little too high level for

2039
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,480
me that is to say

2040
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,880
what are the triggers

2041
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,120
what do these triggers look like

2042
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,480
what functioning

2043
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,320
what functions are intended to be

2044
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,760
triggered

2045
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,000
um

2046
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,440
i guess

2047
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,810
the next step might be

2048
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:00,159
[Music]

2049
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:01,760
for everybody to go read the draft or at

2050
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,040
least for me too

2051
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,080
but

2052
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,320
uh what i'm looking for i'll tell you

2053
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,760
what i'm looking for

2054
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,080
will be a little bit more

2055
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,520
meat in terms of the technical steps

2056
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,440
that would lead to interoperability

2057
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,759
thank you

2058
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,480
okay i see um i will write it down and i

2059
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,800
will do to

2060
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,480
to specif specify

2061
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,280
the

2062
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,719
um methods and the functions

2063
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:34,159
with the colossus okay

2064
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:38,239
yeah hi uh this is charles eckel and

2065
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:39,120
um

2066
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,480
i have to confess i haven't read the

2067
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,320
draft yet but i appreciated your

2068
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,600
presentation

2069
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,120
and um

2070
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,040
one thing i was wondering is do you

2071
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,239
envision

2072
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,480
uh some of these flows just being

2073
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,719
configured like where

2074
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,560
the application or an operator or

2075
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,960
someone who knows certain traffic is

2076
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,280
expected to be on their network they

2077
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,159
they might actually want to

2078
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,080
just configure or let you know about

2079
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,520
ones that exist

2080
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,800
and could that happen in parallel to

2081
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,320
learning

2082
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,199
the flows as well

2083
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,840
question is that

2084
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,239
um uh so we can configure the

2085
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:27,199
flow learning and the same time um the

2086
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:29,040
customers can

2087
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,320
uh

2088
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,920
can um

2089
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,840
you know

2090
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,960
can start flow learnings themselves

2091
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,480
is that in that question

2092
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,760
yeah i guess so i was wondering uh

2093
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,480
explicit configuration rather than kind

2094
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,960
of autonomous learning

2095
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:49,900
oh yeah um

2096
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,520
[Music]

2097
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,400
that's a good vision i think i'll never

2098
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,400
thought about that before because for

2099
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,800
the fight back home is um

2100
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,840
more like the operator's uh

2101
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:07,199
privacy networks and it's not open to

2102
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:08,159
the

2103
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,800
real customers now it's just connecting

2104
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,120
the base stations and

2105
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,199
and our code networks

2106
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:16,480
yeah

2107
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,460
and um maybe if it is um

2108
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,880
[Music]

2109
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,120
in the near future um

2110
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,480
if there is uh some enterprise customers

2111
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,880
uh connecting in our

2112
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,679
networks and we can do that

2113
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:35,040
yeah

2114
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,840
okay thank you

2115
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,400
okay rob uh make a quick you're cutting

2116
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,280
into your time now uh fine okay so um i

2117
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,120
just wanted to basically and say thank

2118
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,880
you for watf

2119
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,719
and i may haven't read the draft on all

2120
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:50,560
i only skimmed it i think my

2121
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,320
one question concern i have is this work

2122
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,840
looks like it might overlap quite

2123
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,760
heavily with the ippm

2124
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,600
working group and i definitely think it

2125
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,320
would be useful for you to present there

2126
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,239
and get their feedback on this because i

2127
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:03,040
don't

2128
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,639
i'm not sure we should do much with it

2129
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:08,239
in upc if ippm aren't supportive and so

2130
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:09,679
i think i'd like to understand exactly

2131
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:11,679
what the scope is of here

2132
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:12,880
and how that relates to the ipp and

2133
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,920
working group that makes sense

2134
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,639
this question

2135
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:21,920
so we have proposed the uh problem

2136
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,120
statement in both ippm and

2137
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,800
ops awg

2138
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,520
and we think um

2139
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,679
so this work is not

2140
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:33,120
um

2141
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,800
so technical to

2142
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,080
how to do the performance monitoring but

2143
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,800
more related to how to manage

2144
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,960
uh or how to deploy

2145
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,159
the

2146
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:47,040
large scale network to support the

2147
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:50,000
performance mandatory so um

2148
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
so last in the

2149
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,960
112th ietf meeting

2150
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,000
um we discussed with drill and so i

2151
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,520
think it is

2152
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,719
can be done here of this work

2153
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,159
okay if we do that i think i need to

2154
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,440
shut the chairs but things would be very

2155
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,400
careful coordination

2156
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,638
thanks rob

2157
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,800
thank you

2158
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,679
uh germain

2159
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,360
can you hear me

2160
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,600
we can hello

2161
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,840
okay

2162
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,520
let me

2163
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,920
present um this

2164
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,320
chapter problem statement and the use

2165
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,480
cases of adaptive traffic that

2166
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,440
collection

2167
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,719
next slide please

2168
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,320
motivation

2169
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,960
first

2170
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,159
i t curry network network needs to

2171
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:02,480
provide real-time traffic visibility to

2172
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,320
help little work upgrade

2173
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,159
quickly and accurately look at the

2174
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:07,280
network

2175
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,760
congestion and packet loss

2176
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,320
make time timely pass adjustment for

2177
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,520
determining

2178
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,120
services to avoid congestion

2179
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,120
on the other hand

2180
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,719
this assistant simply at a mini second

2181
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,440
intervals will generate that constant

2182
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,920
variable amount of data which may claim

2183
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,040
smart transport advanced resource

2184
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,520
we will load the service service for

2185
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,040
data collection storage and analysis

2186
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:40,040
our object objective is to

2187
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,400
explore the adaptive traffic data

2188
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,199
collection mechanism so as to

2189
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,920
capture real-time network state at 10

2190
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,920
million minimal resource consumption

2191
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,840
let's next flight please

2192
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,840
yes

2193
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,600
problem statement

2194
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,960
uh iv network is of traffic-based

2195
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,159
calculation but a long-time

2196
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:16,639

01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:56,400
as long as that's your traffic data

and the longer

01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,920
long congested little conditions which

2255
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,199

interface

2258
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:54,560
so

2259
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,040
it is essential to explore the adaptive

2260
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,080
traffic data collection technicals to

2261

resource consumption

2266
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:14,280
let's start please

2267
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,920
next steps

2268
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,639
we will solid commands and find the

2269
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:24,960
draft accordingly

2270
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,880
possible

2271
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:28,719
implementation and verification that's

2272
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,280
what thank you

2273
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,639
hi xiaoming um thanks very much for your

2274
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,159
presentation

2275
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:43,040
um two comments the first is

2276
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,600
you may be able to do a fair amount you

2277
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,960
may be able to get a fair amount of

2278
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,320
information

2279
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,719
um if you're interested in particular

2280
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,800
thresholding

2281
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,920
activities by using the event map

2282
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,920
which is already defined in the itfs you

2283
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,400
might want to take a look at that the

2284
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:03,040
second point i want to make

2285
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:06,239
is that there was an excellent

2286
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:08,960
presentation earlier in the week

2287
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,040
at the irtf open

2288
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,360
meeting about

2289
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,639
a b

2290
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:17,040
comparisons for research

2291
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,400
which

2292
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,679
looks at

2293
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,000
monitoring

2294
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,840
methodologies

2295
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:24,800
and

2296
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,600
it might bear on how you want to look at

2297
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,560
this problem as well

2298
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,480
okay okay sorry

2299
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,520
i

2300
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,480
i

2301
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,280
don't

2302
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,800
understand what

2303
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:45,280
you can see okay i'll try my apologies

2304
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,320
um

2305
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,800
there exists a mib

2306
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,520
a management information base

2307
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,760
called the event mib

2308
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,760
and the event mib

2309
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:56,719
this is

2310
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:00,159
event as in an event happens

2311
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:02,560
it allows for threshold

2312
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,159
configuration

2313
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:05,280
so that

2314
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,400
when say a certain rate based counter

2315
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,239
exceeds

2316
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:12,480
something or a

2317
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:16,080
queue depth exceeds something you might

2318
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,960
decide to do additional reporting

2319
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,280
through that event map this already

2320
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,440
exists in the ietf and may

2321
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:24,800
help you i don't know if it solves

2322
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,880
completely your problem statement but it

2323
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,520
may help you address at least part of

2324
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,520
your problem statement

2325
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,000
the second point i was making is that

2326
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,719
there was a an applied network research

2327
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:37,760
award

2328
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,360
presentation

2329
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,840
that talked about

2330
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,040
ab

2331
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:47,760
comparisons um for uh traffic treatment

2332
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,880
um done by a a woman

2333
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,840
who was at least doing some work with

2334
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,480
netflix

2335
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,440
and i thought it was a very useful

2336
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,880
way to

2337
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,000
avoid

2338
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,320
buy a thing

2339
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,760
of results something you also may wish

2340
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,639
to to just have a gander at a look at

2341
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:12,239
excuse me

2342
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,480
thank you

2343
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,119
uh okay

2344
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:21,839
we are not okay and looking into that

2345
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:25,920
but my

2346
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,360
my easily ability is available

2347
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,960
please uh

2348
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:31,920
sometimes

2349
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,600
please send your

2350
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,679
comments and the question

2351
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:38,719
to me by email thank you

2352
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:40,159
elliot if you could summarize that on

2353
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:42,800
the list that would be fantastic thanks

2354
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,360
and thanks xiaoming for presenting

2355
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,559
we have our last presentation

2356
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,560
and on the floor is yours

2357
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,679
can you hear me

2358
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,360
we can

2359
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,719
yeah okay

2360
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:15,760
so uh hello everyone um we have our

2361
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,400
also on the call so this presentation is

2362
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,520
about a young model for data export over

2363
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,119
ipfix

2364
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:26,480
um next slide please

2365
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:32,480
so we have uh an existing model so

2366
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,000
sorry

2367
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,480
first of all we are looking at uh ipfix

2368
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,239
as the uh

2369
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:40,320
one of the options for bulk data export

2370
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,719
and one of the main options so

2371
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:45,679
mainly in the broadband access nodes

2372
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:46,480
where

2373
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,719
there is a great need to export a lot of

2374
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:52,320
data uh to the to a centralized location

2375
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,280
and

2376
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:56,239
there is also one more application where

2377
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:58,320
there is a need for exchanging data

2378
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,480
internally within the node so that is

2379
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,320
the ictp case

2380
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,400
where uh uh

2381
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,159
data for two channel terminations are

2382
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:09,840
exchanged between uh the two uh

2383
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,960
uh ng point or ng point of boots are

2384
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,520
within the same board so

2385
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,679
that is one more application next slide

2386
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,000
please

2387
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:21,679
um

2388
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:23,840
we have an existing uh yang model uh

2389
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,400
which was written by benbow

2390
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,560
but it it was in the early days of

2391
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,280
netconf yang and uh

2392
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,360
and meanwhile netconfian has evolved a

2393
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:34,159
lot

2394
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:35,520
and

2395
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,600
even the application of ipfix has also

2396
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,040
evolved from

2397
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,440
just packet sampling towards bulk data

2398
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,199
export so

2399
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:44,880
we have we see quite a lot of

2400
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,800
limitations there where

2401
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,719
it is closely related to packet sampling

2402
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:55,440
closely tied to package sampling and

2403
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:58,400
there is a mandatory uh requirement to

2404
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,639
support a ctp

2405
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:04,480
but satp is not used widely and we don't

2406
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,600
see a

2407
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,639
hope i mean or see a adoption in the

2408
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,880
future or two a wide adoption in the

2409
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,000
future too

2410
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,960
um

2411
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,280
apart from that we also had uh i mean

2412
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,760
have some uh outdated references to

2413
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:21,119
interfaces and uh

2414
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,679
uh statements which i mean uh leaves

2415
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:26,080
which are not no longer uh valid in the

2416
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,920
net confiyang world

2417
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,719
next site please

2418
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,880
so uh okay we already had three

2419
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,360
divisions of

2420
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,600
the previous

2421
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,880
draft so

2422
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,960
the draft underwent a name change

2423
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,280
because of the change in authors so the

2424
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,760
previous draft which we did

2425
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,280
had

2426
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,960
envisioned a replacement for the

2427
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,400
existing 6728 model so

2428
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,199
we

2429
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,520
had tried to update all the

2430
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,000
entire yang that was that in 6728 split

2431
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,239
them into three different models

2432
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:05,040
to for the ease of use in the

2433
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:08,639
uh deployment so iet ipfix had exporter

2434
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:10,480
and collector psamp had the peace and

2435
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,960
specific functions and bulk data export

2436
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,360
focused on the cache and the bulk data

2437
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,480
export related parameters so and we also

2438
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:21,119
made https optional instead of mandatory

2439
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:24,560
to allow for deployments that use tcp

2440
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,080
uh mainly uh with uh tls and also

2441
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,159
updated the referencing to reflect the

2442
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:33,360
current uh reference interface

2443
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,679
references and

2444
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:37,360
addresses

2445
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,519
so

2446
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:42,639
okay next slide please

2447
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,719
so we received a lot of comments on the

2448
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:49,679
uh model um one of the main comment

2449
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:51,520
being that it is too long and it is

2450
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,920
covering a lot of things that uh

2451
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,600
needle uh quite an extensive review so

2452
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,960
uh

2453
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,880
based on the comments we have revised

2454
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,159
the model uh so the new uh draft name on

2455
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,480
the new draft model is an updated

2456
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,199
version where we have uh removed the

2457
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:11,520
psamp and the collecting process and we

2458
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,440
have tried to focus only on the bulk

2459
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,119
data export part of it

2460
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:18,719
so which has the ipfix exporting process

2461
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,440
and uh

2462
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,040
ipfix exporting process and the bulk

2463
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,400
data export

2464
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,719
part of it so uh

2465
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:29,920
this is a

2466
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,119
shorter version of it uh plus we have uh

2467
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:34,960
stuck to only tcp as a transport

2468
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:38,400
protocol and uh removed the file uh

2469
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,480
operations and the file

2470
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,840
and

2471
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,480
http and

2472
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:48,000
udp so which udp is not secure enough so

2473
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,159
we have stuck to http uh sorry tcp here

2474
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:55,719
next slide please

2475
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:00,239
okay so so it's rather a small uh uh uh

2476
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:02,239
display of the young tree so basically

2477
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:04,400
we have the idf ipfix exporting process

2478
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,719
on the top and the bulk data export

2479
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:08,239
which is which is the configuration of

2480
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:10,480
the template ipfix template at the

2481
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,480
bottom

2482
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,280
next slide please

2483
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,440
so uh

2484
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,320
okay we uh we understand that this needs

2485
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,440
to be an ad document but

2486
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,719
after the

2487
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:26,560
comments were addressed and we called

2488
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,800
for an adoption in the mail mailing list

2489
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,840
but we have not received any feedback on

2490
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,760
that yet so

2491
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:36,239
we would like to know uh the comments

2492
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:39,199
and if there are any

2493
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:41,280
challenges in moving towards

2494
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,960
wg adoption for this draft

2495
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:47,119
i think the next slide also summarizes

2496
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:48,159
the same

2497
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:50,239
maybe one more point to add is that

2498
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:52,800
there is an open liaison request from

2499
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,719
bbf and uh

2500
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,080
uh the link to that is shared here so uh

2501
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:00,960
uh bbf is actively looking towards uh

2502
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:04,400
this draft getting adopted as an rfc

2503
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,800
yeah

2504
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,119
any questions comments

2505
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:11,040
we have a couple minutes for comments i

2506
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,880
tried to run a poll but it wasn't

2507
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,760
asynchronous i was trying to see who had

2508
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,760
potentially read this new version of the

2509
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,480
people who were able to respond five

2510
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,560
uh out of the 13 and out of the 18

2511
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,480
participants said they had

2512
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,320
so that doesn't leave a lot of people

2513
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:29,440
who maybe read it rob

2514
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,920
uh yes so thank you for thank you for

2515
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,600
persevering because i know this has been

2516
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,119
quite a long and

2517
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:36,560
quite hard process for you to try and

2518
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,480
get this work progressing so

2519
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:39,360
um

2520
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,760
as i understand it before i was an aed

2521
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,840
the previous um

2522
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,840
ops management lady agreed to ad sponsor

2523
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,920
it but it hadn't progressed at that time

2524
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,000
and there was concern raised that

2525
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,639
the previous version this was trying to

2526
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:56,080
uh obsolete uh the previous

2527
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,920
uh standard track rfc and i was thought

2528
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,600
that was inappropriate to do that

2529
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,040
through

2530
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,119
sponsored i personally i mean i don't

2531
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:04,880
have that much experience with ipfix

2532
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,719
myself and i'm keen to try and get these

2533
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:08,159
things through the working group as much

2534
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:10,400
as possible i'm really pleased that

2535
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,679
you've um

2536
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,119
cut down the size of the draft i think

2537
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:16,080
the previous 150 pages down to

2538
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,960
50 pages which mostly just yang now um

2539
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,280
with a bit more so i would please ask

2540
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,800
the working group if they can help give

2541
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,719
this attention and try and get this one

2542
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:25,760
through because

2543
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,119
i think it's important that we actually

2544
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:29,199
help the bbf who are trying to do the

2545
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:30,639
right thing here

2546
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:31,679
and i would rather try and get it

2547
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:32,960
through the working group and get more

2548
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,880
eyes on it and get a good document then

2549
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,040
they gave our the ad sponsor path which

2550
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,159
i don't think would get quite a good

2551
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:39,199
result

2552
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:41,920
so thank you for bringing this here

2553
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,159
yeah thanks rob

2554
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:46,080
sorry real quick and i think given his

2555
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,480
as chair i think given the restructuring

2556
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,920
we could do another

2557
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,719
uh call and see if there is

2558
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:56,960
renewed interest in picking up this work

2559
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:59,199
yeah just to reiterate uh we are no

2560
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:03,360
longer obsoleting rfc 6728 so it's an

2561
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,199
entirely new draft that we are proposing

2562
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:07,720
now

2563
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:10,899
[Music]

2564
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,840
uh elliott and sorry if we're difficult

2565
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,080
to hear i'm trying to

2566
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,199
get into the mind because it might

2567
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:19,599
express

2568
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,960
yeah you are a little faint joe i i

2569
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,560
don't know what's going on but

2570
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,199
um my suggestion here

2571
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:29,119
uh to the working group i like the idea

2572
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:30,719
of the call for adoption i would delay

2573
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:32,560
it by a month and then

2574
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:33,679
um

2575
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,679
maybe the chairs can harass us a little

2576
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,520
bit on ops area working group to make

2577
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,560
sure that we're reading because uh it it

2578
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,320
does sound like it's it

2579
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:45,040
anytime we see something that that

2580
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,960
you know there's clearly some value in

2581
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,320
the concept

2582
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,480
clear if bbf is asking for it that's

2583
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,000
even more important

2584
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,159
and you know to at least pay a little

2585
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:56,239
attention to it and

2586
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:57,440
um

2587
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,159
you know i i think though that the small

2588
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:01,440
number of people who read it as

2589
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:04,159
indicated on the um in the poll

2590
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:06,560
is a little bit concerning so just a

2591
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,080
little harassment from the chairs and

2592
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,480
giving a little extra time to read it

2593
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:11,679
um

2594
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:13,040
it could allow us

2595
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,000
to

2596
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
to get a better read on on whether it's

2597
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,480
ready for adoption

2598
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,960
[Music]

2599
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:27,040
yeah you can you can get any time joe

2600
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,480
with that

2601
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:33,599
hank anything to add

2602
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:38,000
so we had some uh um documents in the uh

2603
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,119
early agenda stage uh that uh

2604
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:43,520
might could we could be in the candidate

2605
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:46,239
state for last call at least for review

2606
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:47,280
i think

2607
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,159
they were mud related i guess and and so

2608
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,719
we didn't they didn't come up today

2609
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:54,320
we will take care of that if we press

2610
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,400
some review buttons here we will

2611
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,119
uh confirm the editors and then

2612
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:02,519
go from there

2613
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,800
thanks and with that uh rob and warren

2614
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:10,159
would you like to take us home

2615
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,000
i gave them more than 10 minutes i win

2616
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,840
how long how tall do you think i am

2617
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,159
anyway

2618
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:30,440
hatism that's too short

2619
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,920
well this is this is for the first time

2620
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,440
i've formally been standing in front of

2621
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,360
you as an ad which is sort of quite nice

2622
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,600
um and the first time

2623
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,119
so um

2624
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:44,800
i think it's really if you've got any

2625
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,719
questions for us it'd be lovely to hear

2626
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:48,320
them um normally when we ask this sort

2627
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,480
of question we get no response even in

2628
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,480
the uh plenary yesterday there was no

2629
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,560
questions to the isg so probably the

2630
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,000
opportunity to have no questions here

2631
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,960
but we would invite them um we'd also

2632
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:01,280
invite any feedback and comments back to

2633
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:03,360
warren i that's also something we

2634
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,840
actively like and look for um and the

2635
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,760
last point from my side is that if

2636
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,760
there's folks that are interested in

2637
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,560
stepping up and helping doing like um

2638
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,040
doc sheparding or they're interested in

2639
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,800
like working with chair roles that sort

2640
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,800
of thing then do email warren and i

2641
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,480
contact us and we'll see what we can do

2642
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:21,599
to help

2643
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:26,080
facilitate that sort of path in the itf

2644
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,560
and my turn

2645
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:29,360
so

2646
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:31,360
as you all probably know i've been doing

2647
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,760
this a.d thing for a while now

2648
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,840
and i am still enjoying it and it's

2649
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,280
still fun

2650
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,599
but at the end of

2651
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:42,400
this year slash march of next year

2652
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,920
i would have been i could have finished

2653
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,679
my third term

2654
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:47,679
and i think it would be good if there

2655
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:49,840
were other candidates for the nomcom to

2656
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,679
choose between and for the community to

2657
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:52,960
select from

2658
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,719
so i don't yet know whether our toss

2659
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,320
might happen in the ring again it's a

2660
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,080
nice hat though you must admit

2661
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,080
um but you know i would like to chat

2662
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,840
with some people about what it's like

2663
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,520
being an ad

2664
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,440
how much time it takes the fun bits the

2665
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,960
not so fun bits

2666
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,480
so if you think that you might be

2667
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:11,599
willing to run for op cd please let me

2668
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:12,480
know

2669
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,080
um and i think it's always good for

2670
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,760
there to be some new blood and

2671
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:16,960
changeover

2672
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:17,760
so

2673
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,239
you know this is sort of a plea for

2674
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:22,480
people to step up and be willing to

2675
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:23,360
serve

2676
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,400
it is fun

2677
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,159
um i mean you do have to work with rob

2678
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:28,239
but other than that it's fun

2679
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:30,800
crappy's right behind me

2680
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,880
um no i mean it's a fun job one of the

2681
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,199
nice things is you're expected to read

2682
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:37,119
all of the new drafts

2683
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:39,040
and so yep

2684
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,560
we all know how that goes but you know

2685
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,000
if you're forced to read them you

2686
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,360
actually end up learning a bunch of

2687
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,199
interesting things you're like wow i

2688
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:46,719
would never have read that if i wasn't

2689
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:48,000
forced to

2690
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,040
and

2691
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,400
it's actually

2692
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,159
it really is one of the better parts of

2693
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:54,800
it maybe not at the time but

2694
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,040
um

2695
01:50:57,119 --> 01:50:59,360
it's a reasonable time investment

2696
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:00,560
but

2697
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:03,280
you know the first what year is fairly

2698
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,560
unpleasant while you're trying to figure

2699
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,520
out what you actually have to pay

2700
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:06,960
attention to

2701
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,880
after that it becomes a lot easier when

2702
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:10,480
you're like this i don't care about this

2703
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,639
i don't care about that i'm gonna

2704
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:14,560
work on you know build up a structure

2705
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,000
and a system

2706
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:16,880
um

2707
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:18,800
and yeah once again you know please

2708
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,639
consider doing this

2709
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:23,520
um it doesn't have to be a full-time job

2710
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,840
if you let it become one it definitely

2711
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:26,880
will

2712
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:30,080
but no it really doesn't have to be

2713
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,920
and please come and chat with me chat

2714
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:33,119
with rob

2715
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:34,560
etc

2716
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,119
and open mic there must be at least some

2717
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:39,119
set of questions

2718
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:40,560
you can't possibly think that we're

2719
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,239
doing an awesome job

2720
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:44,400
all the time can you

2721
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,199
um

2722
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:46,880
alan the mike

2723
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:49,199
ah

2724
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,520
okay hi i'm trying i was trying to turn

2725
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:01,679
on my video here but i think i did the

2726
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:03,599
wrong thing all right here we go there

2727
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:04,719
we go

2728
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:05,840
hi

2729
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,040
hi

2730
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:07,760
so

2731
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:08,639
um

2732
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:11,440
uh here's the question and and um

2733
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:13,760
it's one that um

2734
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,199
folks who have been following the

2735
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:17,679
upstairs mailing list

2736
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:21,199
probably have some inkling about

2737
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:22,719
i was the

2738
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:25,360
stuckey reviewing the

2739
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,840
the quick manageability draft

2740
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:32,800
and uh in that draft i happen to find

2741
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,239
that uh

2742
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:37,760
there were statements where

2743
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,239
essentially the the authors and then

2744
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:42,719
ultimately we found out that

2745
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:46,000
it was a strong working group consensus

2746
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,280
that

2747
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,920
they wanted to at least recommend

2748
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,159
um

2749
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:53,199
network

2750
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:54,400
admission

2751
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,320
uh

2752
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,360
settings

2753
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,480
where we

2754
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:01,199
as operators network operators where we

2755
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:04,320
would not uh look at the version number

2756
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:08,400
uh and consider that as uh as part of uh

2757
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,480
admission control

2758
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,000
and

2759
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,679
that struck me as

2760
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:16,159
maybe out of bounds for uh

2761
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:18,719
uh for a draft to specify or a future

2762
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:20,639
rfc to specify

2763
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:22,080
because

2764
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:25,360
admission control is enforcement of

2765
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:27,839
policy

2766
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,199
and

2767
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:30,320
i don't

2768
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:32,400
as an operator

2769
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:35,520
i don't as an operator want any rfc

2770
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,440
to specify

2771
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:40,159
policy

2772
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:42,159
so i'm wondering if other operators

2773
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:43,760
agree

2774
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:47,679
and if the ops area in general agrees

2775
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:49,360
and it's going to take that kind of

2776
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,360
consensus i believe to do something

2777
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,639
about this

2778
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:55,040
because in my comments back

2779
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,159
uh

2780
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:57,760
what i've heard you know from the

2781
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,000
authors who are i consider both friends

2782
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:00,960
of mine

2783
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,040
um and other folks from

2784
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,440
the working group who are friends that

2785
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,599
this is this is working group consensus

2786
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:10,639
and we can't do anything about it

2787
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:13,119
so it's ultimately going to come to

2788
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:14,800
a head somewhere

2789
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:15,840
um

2790
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,840
i'm not getting much uh satisfaction

2791
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,760
with that particular point but that's

2792
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:21,599
the one i wanted to raise here today

2793
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:23,840
thank you

2794
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:32,400
so elliot is your comment on this

2795
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:36,639
uh it's a clarifying question um

2796
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:41,199
so hey uh uh how you doing al um

2797
01:54:41,199 --> 01:54:44,000
my uh my my clarifying question is is

2798
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,639
the is is that in the text because the

2799
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:49,360
information might be unreliable

2800
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,040
or is it in the text

2801
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:54,159
why is the recommendation made because

2802
01:54:54,159 --> 01:54:56,239
it it may be that they're saying this

2803
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:57,920
this is something that operators should

2804
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,080
not rely on for policy because it may it

2805
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,480
could be completely bogus or or whatever

2806
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:07,040
the case may be what was their logic

2807
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:10,800
well i've heard lots of feedback on that

2808
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,199
some of it is that

2809
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:16,880
the version numbers will change fast

2810
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,639
that there will be additional work on

2811
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:23,280
this and and a new version fairly soon

2812
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,400
and

2813
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,000
the

2814
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,840
the underlying

2815
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,320
uh sentiment that seems to come through

2816
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:31,199
is

2817
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:33,760
um you know treating operators like they

2818
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,480
were back in 1998 where there was you

2819
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:39,119
know you know very infrequent changes of

2820
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:42,000
network policy and they like to relegate

2821
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,440
operators to

2822
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:45,280
uh you know the fact that their only

2823
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:48,560
role is is ossification

2824
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:50,880
and and i think that's a

2825
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,880
you know

2826
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,760
it's a it's a very much a convenient

2827
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:58,239
view for uh the the particular working

2828
01:55:58,239 --> 01:55:59,760
group to take

2829
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,599
but i i would contend that it's very

2830
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:06,320
much of a view from the past thank you

2831
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,719
so so i mean this is warren i mean it is

2832
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:10,480
somewhat of a difficult

2833
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:11,840
question

2834
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,000
because i think some of it is also the

2835
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,320
belief that

2836
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,560
seeing as you can't really tell what's

2837
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,920
in the stream

2838
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:22,159
you're potentially blocking or you know

2839
01:56:22,159 --> 01:56:24,639
doing admission control on something

2840
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:26,960
which is somewhat arbitrary right like

2841
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:29,599
whether it's version x or version y

2842
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:31,440
you still don't really know what's in

2843
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:32,880
the rest of it

2844
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,320
and so

2845
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,880
what are you making this decision on

2846
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:37,840
um

2847
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,599
and then there's also the

2848
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:41,360
sort of what if we try and deploy this

2849
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:44,480
and realize that we get stuck because

2850
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,400
somebody has done admission control in

2851
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,239
this and now we can't deploy a new

2852
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:49,280
version

2853
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,920
so i don't actually know what the right

2854
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,760
answer is i mean i think it's perfectly

2855
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:57,520
fine to raise it as a concern and

2856
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,520
after a few back and forths

2857
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,800
you know you could only just throw your

2858
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,880
hands up and be like well

2859
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:05,119
this is what i as an operator and other

2860
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:06,560
operators think

2861
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:07,440
and

2862
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:11,199
let us know and you know rob and i can

2863
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:12,800
try and do something like put a discuss

2864
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,000
on it

2865
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,920
or something

2866
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:18,080
um right if they end up in the position

2867
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,440
where

2868
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,800
you express

2869
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,840
you do upstair review

2870
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,639
it's incredibly helpful if you try and

2871
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:30,159
push the position and get too consensus

2872
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:32,400
but if you can't you know

2873
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:35,199
let us know and we can try and do the

2874
01:57:35,199 --> 01:57:37,599
this is what the operators are saying

2875
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:39,920
and it's a valid concern

2876
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,239
and it needs to be addressed

2877
01:57:42,239 --> 01:57:43,199
um

2878
01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:45,199
you know we'd prefer not to be left kind

2879
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:47,040
of holding the bag but that's kind of

2880
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:48,480
what we're here for

2881
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,239
and then i'd prefer if rob does it

2882
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:54,718
because after all say wg is his side

2883
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,920
so one follow up to that uh quickly

2884
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:01,920
warren um i i'm raising it here that the

2885
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,239
the question in the topic because um i

2886
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:06,800
mean right now it's my opinion uh as an

2887
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,520
operator i'm trying to find out as if as

2888
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:10,639
you said

2889
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:11,920
um

2890
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,239
are there more operators that share this

2891
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:15,920
opinion

2892
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:19,119
and we have some time to figure that out

2893
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:21,520
um and then and then the other the other

2894
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:23,119
side of this is i i think it's a

2895
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:25,599
perfectly reasonable policy for

2896
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:27,840
operators to decide on

2897
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,920
uh that they admit

2898
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,440
of

2899
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,199
traffic with

2900
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:38,400
version numbers that has a published rfc

2901
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,920
and then i don't you know and then if i

2902
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,239
want to see what's inside

2903
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:46,880
i can do active testing i don't have to

2904
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:49,520
do uh i mean the other the other point

2905
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,840
of view that that was inherent in this

2906
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,560
in this draft uh as it moved forward but

2907
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,320
was an implicit part of the scope and

2908
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,639
we've discovered this in the comments

2909
01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:00,639
is that they really felt all that

2910
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:02,960
operators would do would be the passive

2911
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,840
on the wire monitoring and that's not

2912
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,000
that's no longer true and and it's it's

2913
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,199
not it's particularly uh untrue in this

2914
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:13,119
case i mean you know we've been

2915
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:16,960
challenged to find new methods to manage

2916
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:20,080
our traffic and and one of those methods

2917
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,080
is apparently you're going to have to be

2918
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:25,280
uh setting up our own endpoints and

2919
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,440
terminating the traffic ourselves and

2920
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:28,880
trying to figure out what's wrong with

2921
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:31,599
it all this and this is all under the

2922
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:34,080
assumption that the operator wants to

2923
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:36,400
support quick

2924
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,480
and that seems to be anathema to this

2925
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:41,360
working group as well

2926
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:43,040
yeah i mean i think you've identified

2927
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,880
sort of one of the key bits here which

2928
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:48,560
is there's definitely a tension between

2929
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:51,199
some of the views in you know certain

2930
01:59:51,199 --> 01:59:52,800
working groups like quick and some of

2931
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,280
the views of operators

2932
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:56,880
like there's a tension of

2933
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,119
a belief that operators are out to be

2934
01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:01,360
difficult and no information should ever

2935
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,360
be exposed to them ever because they

2936
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:05,840
will just do bad things

2937
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:08,159
versus the operator view of like well if

2938
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:09,520
you want to pass the

2939
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,440
traffic over my network i kind of need

2940
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,520
to know what it is so i can protect my

2941
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,040
network from it

2942
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:16,960
and you know that was somewhat discussed

2943
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,239
discussed and

2944
02:00:18,239 --> 02:00:20,480
kathleen's effect and crypt and a few

2945
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,920
other ones

2946
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:23,280
and

2947
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,040
it's definitely

2948
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:26,880
the tension is definitely stronger in

2949
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:30,080
certain groups and areas than others um

2950
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:31,920
but yeah i mean i

2951
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,440
i think it's perfectly reasonable for

2952
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,119
operators to want to be able to force

2953
02:00:35,119 --> 02:00:38,719
policy on whatever they like

2954
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:42,159
um i guess one thing that i'll note is

2955
02:00:42,159 --> 02:00:44,480
even if the rfc says you know you can't

2956
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:45,679
do this

2957
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:48,239
if your box has the knob your box has

2958
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:49,520
the knob

2959
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:50,320
um

2960
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,000
this sounds very much like the nuclear

2961
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,520
option of like i don't really care what

2962
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:55,920
urfc says i'm gonna do x

2963
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:58,480
which definitely doesn't help

2964
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:00,560
repair any of the tension but yeah like

2965
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,080
i'd like to know what other operators

2966
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,840
think on this topic if they've been

2967
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,599
following the discussion etc and i think

2968
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:08,000
i stepped in front of rob

2969
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,760
yes i was just going to continue from a

2970
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:11,360
different perspective i think that one

2971
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:12,639
thing's important they're saying that

2972
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:14,159
this has working group consensus on this

2973
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:16,000
decision but the documents that we

2974
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,320
publish have to have itf rough consensus

2975
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,239
so i don't think that that alone is

2976
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:22,480
sufficient to say you can't discuss this

2977
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:23,520
has already been decided that's

2978
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,000
definitely not in scope and as warren

2979
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,159
says we will help support you in that

2980
02:01:28,159 --> 02:01:31,040
the the the side of it that the ops the

2981
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:32,800
ir reviews are really important from us

2982
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,480
because you help offload a bit of the

2983
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,920
work from warren and i that we've had an

2984
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:38,000
opt-i review it means that we don't have

2985
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,280
to necessarily spend quite so much time

2986
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:40,800
reviewing those documents

2987
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,480
and when we have 400 pages of documents

2988
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:44,480
to review uh along with everything else

2989
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,480
that's really helpful so so abd all the

2990
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:48,719
ops dr reviews are great and really

2991
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:50,960
helpful on this particular point i think

2992
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:52,960
the other thing that might be worth

2993
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:55,040
pushing back on is saying can this be

2994
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,560
expressed in a different way so rather

2995
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:58,719
than saying you should not do this field

2996
02:01:58,719 --> 02:02:00,480
you should shouldn't do this filtering

2997
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,239
say these are the problems that can

2998
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:04,320
arise when this if you do this filtering

2999
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:06,560
and then so it's not enforcing a policy

3000
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,480
it's just saying consider this when

3001
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:09,920
you're when you're applying this that

3002
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:11,760
that might be a sort of compromised way

3003
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:13,760
that gets the message across without

3004
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,599
putting any rules in place

3005
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:18,080
yeah and i tried some alternate text and

3006
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:20,400
and it was rejected uh i don't you know

3007
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,080
the answer was i i don't want to change

3008
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:24,320
the consensus text

3009
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:25,760
there you go

3010
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:28,000
sorry and just one quick note i mean yes

3011
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,159
as rob said you know upstairs really

3012
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:31,119
helpful

3013
02:02:31,119 --> 02:02:33,360
if you run into issues like this it's

3014
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:35,840
also extra helpful to just drop rob and

3015
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:38,400
i a note so that we know to be paying

3016
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,719
attention earlier and more attention and

3017
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:42,159
not just sort of look at the upstairs

3018
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:44,080
thing and be like well

3019
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,599
there was some discussion and it got

3020
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:47,280
resolved so yeah

3021
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:49,199
yeah sorry man but i think i already did

3022
02:02:49,199 --> 02:02:49,570
that

3023
02:02:49,570 --> 02:02:53,280
[Laughter]

3024
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,679
well uh just a couple of things oh hello

3025
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:56,960
this is diego

3026
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,400
hi diego

3027
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:00,480
good to see that you have a so well

3028
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,719
decorated wall behind you it's uh it's

3029
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:04,880
amazing

3030
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:08,800
yeah it gets them out of my drawers

3031
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:12,560
well no yes you were asking for for the

3032
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:14,400
opinion of more operators and for us

3033
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:16,000
it's a it's a concern and you know it's

3034
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,520
a concern and we have been talking about

3035
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:19,840
this uh quite often

3036
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:22,159
um precisely probably i remember some

3037
02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:24,480
time ago there was in the in the

3038
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:26,480
transfer group there was a

3039
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:29,040
draft that was

3040
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:31,360
promoted by uh

3041
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:33,520
gauri fanhurst from the university of

3042
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,280
edinburgh that was very much involved in

3043
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:37,679
this precisely about the operational

3044
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:40,560
implications of the use of transport

3045
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,320
transfer pervasive encryption and all

3046
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:43,280
the like

3047
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,840
and uh my impression is precisely they

3048
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:48,239
don't they don't fly as they should but

3049
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:51,679
probably this group is one two this is

3050
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:53,679
one that is very adequate to raise these

3051
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:55,280
concerns because it's about we're

3052
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:56,480
talking about operations we're not

3053
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:58,320
talking about anything else we're not

3054
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:00,560
questioning at all the right of everyone

3055
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:02,639
to have a privacy in the communications

3056
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:05,280
or whatever it is about well but we want

3057
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:08,239
to run properly the damn networks and

3058
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:10,159
this is something something again that i

3059
02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:11,599
had tried to

3060
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:13,760
raise these uh going in some

3061
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:16,000
conversations with people from icehock

3062
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
is about the implication this would have

3063
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,079
in the sustainability in the economic

3064
02:04:20,079 --> 02:04:23,360
sustainability of the internet ecosystem

3065
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:24,719
not when talking about sustainability

3066
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:26,159
i'm not talking about green things or

3067
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:27,760
whatever that is important as well but

3068
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,920
it's about that there is a

3069
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:34,320
group of different uh um

3070
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:37,679
entities that have been making money and

3071
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:40,079
earning earning a decent life from from

3072
02:04:40,079 --> 02:04:41,920
operating the internet

3073
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:44,400
if we push in in a single direction this

3074
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:46,960
would be would make

3075
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:48,880
the internet unsustainable in the

3076
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,280
current terms and for example the basic

3077
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:53,520
network service would become i mean the

3078
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:55,199
only way if the if we go in that

3079
02:04:55,199 --> 02:04:57,840
direction it will become as a state

3080
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:59,679
monopoly and i think

3081
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:01,360
that very few people would like to see

3082
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:03,679
this happening here and in many other

3083
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:05,599
places in the at least in the western

3084
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:07,840
world

3085
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:11,520
i know it's a fully political

3086
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:13,280
opinion i know but

3087
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:15,520
things have consequences and we have to

3088
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:19,159
learn to live with that

3089
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,079
so five minutes over closing your marks

3090
02:05:27,199 --> 02:05:28,719
my only closing remark is thank you for

3091
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:30,960

3092
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:34,400
yep and extra thanks to upstairs and

3093

3094
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,920
willing to you know consider running a

3095
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:40,320
cd

3096
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:46,119
have a great evening everyone

3097
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:52,320

3098
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,719
wg

3099
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:59,599
