get started

11
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,040
i see that we have at least one of our

12
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
speakers in

13
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
the meeting so

14
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,360
um so welcome everyone we have to start

15
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
unfortunately by

16
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,440
revising this very first slide on the

17
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,640
agenda

18
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
because i didn't update it um but we

19
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,400
have

20
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,840
um

21
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,120
on the agenda um an aob that i'm

22
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,360
allocating 15 minutes to not five so

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,519
we're going to reduce the time on the

24
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,400
two drafts like five minutes each sophia

25
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
welcome

26
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,680
okay so first um

27
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,760
i if i could ask we don't actually have

28
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,040
anyone in vienna um from from neither of

29
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
sofia and i are there um so we see a

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
very sad empty chair

31
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,920
um

32
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,440
there are a few people in the audience

33
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,239
so in the mic the mic line is actually

34
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,200
rather far away so if um there could

35
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
just be a little mindfulness in the room

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,159
help us uh thanks meetup folks now we

37
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,599
can see the mic line better so if there

38
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,439
are folks that need to speak you just

39
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,040
walk up to the queue and

40
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,080
we can

41
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,400
um call on you from there

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,879
um also if i could ask um if there's

43
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,080
anyone willing to take notes

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,959
for us um i think sophia may be able to

45
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,360
do that but she would like some help as

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,360

together to

61
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
um create amazing

62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,320
drafts um proposals so very happy for

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,240
this work as well and thank you very

64
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,160
much

65
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,479
yeah thank you and thanks to colin who

66
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,360
um worked hard to to get you on boarded

67
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
so we're really appreciative of that

68
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
effort as well

69
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,280
um and it's really nice as well to have

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
a balance so we have you coming from a

71
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
private sector

72
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,320
as cloudflare and then um

73
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,400
the civil society balance is good

74
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,840
so um

75
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,600
with that we will just go through the um

76
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,840
the usual welcoming slides i'm going to

77
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,800
spend a little bit more time on the

78
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,400
hrpc history um because we have some new

79
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,520
folks joining us today

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
um but first obviously the notewell this

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
is the slide that explains um the

82
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,320
intellectual property piece

83
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,720
you've probably all seen this

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,960
many times already um

85
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
i separated out the specifically the

86
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,319
privacy and code of contact piece

87
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
because that's really important as well

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,880
um

89
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,759
for this meeting

90
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,400
in the irtf um

91
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
which is where this research group is

92
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
situated where we're really focused on

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
the long-term research issues related to

94
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,199
the internet

95
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,240
um

96
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,759
and of course we're trying to our best

97
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,440
to conduct research we're not developing

98
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,880
standards

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,199
trying our best to conduct good research

100
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,960
we're now developing standards

101
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,479
and and also to that end

102
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,919
our documents are informational

103
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
um so then hrpc was

104
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,759
chartered

105
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,400
in order to look at

106
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,319
the human rights

107
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,199
as it's it's explained in the universal

108
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
declaration of human rights

109
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,199
and iccpr so

110
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,319
um

111
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,960
specifically we call out in our charter

112
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
to human rights the right

113
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,680
to

114
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,919
freedom of expression and freedom of

115
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,599
assembly

116
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,280
although there are others including the

117
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
right to privacy which is

118
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,919
more aligned with the privacy

119
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,520
enhancements and assessments research

120
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,840
group so there's definitely some

121
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
some overlap and collaboration between

122
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,440
the two research groups but we do not

123
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
focus specifically on that human right

124
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,880
um

125
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,680
we are trying to provide guidelines for

126
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
those working in the ietf and on

127
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
protocols so

128
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,759
one of our current documents

129
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
does that very well

130
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
and and then

131
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
there is just the um

132
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,080
raising awareness of the issues in

133
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,000
this community of human rights we do

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,080
that through bringing in speakers to our

135
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,960
sessions um and we're excited for those

136
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,800
um talks today which i'll go over when i

137
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
go back to the agenda slide

138
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
so far we do have

139
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,000
a um an rfc 8280

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,199
our other internet drafts

141
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
have covered variety of topics some that

142
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
are no longer active but um are really

143
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,479
looking at um

144
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,680
the the

145
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,919
overlaps between the human rights space

146
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,360
and the protocol development space um

147
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,080
there have been others as well that have

148
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,120
presented hrpc or

149
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
who have started work here that are

150
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
publishing elsewhere so they're taking

151
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,199
their work and their papers into

152
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,199
academic journals and

153
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,680
academic conferences so recognizing that

154
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,759
that is actually an explicit goal of

155
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,840
hrpc is to have

156
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,559
publications go elsewhere not just

157
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
in the rfc series

158
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,399
and there's actually a film that was

159
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,200
done

160
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
so it's an interesting opportunity for

161
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
us to think about other media that might

162
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,640
reach some of these goals for us

163
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,959
you can watch the film on hrpc.io

164
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,399
that was

165
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,440
launched

166
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,000
some years back

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
and we've also talked a lot about data

168
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,959
and visualization um through big bang

169
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,640
and other things i think sebastian

170
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
presented last session on big bang and

171
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,440
how to do analysis of mailing lists and

172
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,800
things like that so

173
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,680
again

174
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,760
really fits in with our with our

175
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,080
research um and then against i think

176
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,519
some of the guidelines and and

177
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,519
suggestions we make about the

178
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,040
relationship between human rights and

179
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,440
protocols um others have been able to

180
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
take that guidance and actually review

181
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,720
um

182
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,800
other other work

183
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
um

184
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,959
in in the ietf and elsewhere so

185
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,200
um i've probably gone through a lot of

186
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
this but our charter was was from 2015

187
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,440
the rfc 8280s from 2017.

188
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,600
um

189
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
and then here's our the current state so

190
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
actually the only two that are active on

191
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,519
this list are guidelines and freedom

192
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,800
association

193
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
the feminism and protocols in the

194
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,120
political draft are inactive but i put

195
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
them on there because i do think that

196
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,040
there are folks interested in that work

197
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,640
it just hasn't progressed recently

198
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,600
so let me slide all the way back to the

199
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,720
agenda

200
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,440
so after that um intro we're actually

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,519
really good on time now which is great

202
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,720
so um just checking to see if john is

203
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,920
here because if not we can always have

204
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,040
i'm here

205
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,560
oh great john welcome so um

206
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,040
you should be able to present yeah okay

207
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,079
good so i will

208
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
i will welcome you

209
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,240
and go off camera while you present

210
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,600
so i guess you can see my slides yeah

211
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,800
so this is an update of the presentation

212
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,839
i held in 2019 here in hr pc

213
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,760
about privacy and surveillance and

214
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
security in fighting this is an update

215
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
that presentation talking about what was

216
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,920
actually done what was not done and

217
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,640
the new things consequences of that and

218
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,440
new things that had happened since then

219
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,240
uh

220
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,600
first a little bit about 3d pp so as you

221
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,440
know 3dpp operates in this 10 years

222
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,360
generations 2d 3d 4d 5d60

223
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,240
uh a little bit less known is that three

224
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,800
3d people also works in five year half

225
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,560
releases of these the prs and hspa are

226
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,440
maybe the most known and then 3dpp works

227
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,560
in this one to two year releases

228
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
currently 3d people are working on

229
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,079
release 17 and 18 in in in parallel

230
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,640
and right now i think 2d to 5d are still

231
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,600
active

232
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
and in use 2g in 3d will be in just a

233
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,320
few years it will be shut down in most

234
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,440
places of the world around 2025. i think

235
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
at least in africa

236
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
asia europe in america

237
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
north america it will be shut down by

238
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,279
them in almost all countries africa

239
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,079
african countries are still planning to

240
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,639
to use 2d treaty for maybe a decade more

241
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,880
or so

242
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,160
so one of the things i talked about 2019

243
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,120
was the battle against mc catchers and

244
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
false base stations

245
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
and i'm happy to report that basically

246
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,399
everything i

247
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
said was

248
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,600
planned at that time actually happened

249
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
everything was

250
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,519
approved at least in the standards then

251
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,720
how much it's actually used in

252
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
practice for example detection force

253
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,880
base station that's harder to answer

254
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,920
uh so is this an end to the battle

255
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,880
against that false base station

256
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,839
well

257
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,959
maybe maybe long term but there are some

258
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,560
things that are

259
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,200
still not perfect i think these slides

260
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,399
summarize

261
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,760
all of them

262
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,839
one thing is that this

263
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,839
so in 5g the mc which is the identifier

264
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,120
for the subscriber it's encrypted when

265
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,040
you send it over the air

266
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,600
but this is mandatory to support but

267
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,320
optional to use optional security is not

268
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
really considered best

269
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
practice anymore but 3d people really

270
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,000
like to make things optional

271
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,839
to use

272
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,600
even given that

273
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,399
my understanding is that this will be

274
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,519
turned on and used in in large part of

275
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,519
the world but i don't have any exact

276
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,880
details of

277
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,680
where and when if you want to know more

278
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,800
i think contact your home operator or

279
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
operators in in general

280
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,160
if your home operator supports this your

281
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,199
mc will be encrypted even when you are

282
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,240
roaming

283
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,800
globally

284
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,040
another limitation is that the

285
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,959
identifier mc consists of a country code

286
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,360
a network code and a subscriber

287
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,279
identification number

288
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,480
and the encryption only encrypts the

289
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,519
subscriber identification number

290
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,920
similar if if you use an i which is a

291
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,199
probability in 3d only the username is

292
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,600
encrypted and the realm is sent in clear

293
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,720
text

294
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,600
so potentially when you're roaming

295
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,639
you can track and identify users by

296
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,199
looking at the country code network code

297
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,000
or by looking at the realm um

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,920
and this is very similar to iotf

299
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,880
standards as eap where you also

300
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,040
send the realm in in clear text where it

301
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,440
might be more of a problem in 3d people

302
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,360
where rooming is very

303
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,519
common

304
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,000
this is however hard a problem to solve

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,079
gdp discussed this a couple years ago

306
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,959
but did not agree on any

307
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,320
trade-off

308
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,160
might be discussed more in the future i

309
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,959
think more academic research on this

310
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,800
but on the problems and potential

311
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,479
solutions would be welcome

312
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,600
another problem is legacy interrupts

313
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,560
even if this is encrypted in 5d it's not

314
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,000
encrypted in in earlier standards

315
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,440
5g introduces new protection so a

316
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,000
false base station or a stingray cannot

317
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,480
trick a phone to downgrade to for

318
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,800
example 2d 3d or 4g

319
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
but when you turn on your phone if the

320
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,360
only thing you see is the 2g fake base

321
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,759
station your phone will connect to that

322
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,920
and similarly you could theoretically

323
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,959
jam for example 5d frequencies or not

324
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,199
but i don't think we have seen that in

325
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,440
in in practice anywhere that's

326
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,880
complicated

327
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,240
uh

328
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,680
android 12 is introducing it to the or

329
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,839
have introduced it to the kill switch

330
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,920
you can turn off 2d i think this is

331
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,759
great news i've personally been

332
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,480
requesting this for for a long time i

333
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,079
think if you have any other phones like

334
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,000
an older android or an appley

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,519
unfortunately out of luck

336
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
one recent example of

337
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,360
mobile identity tracking was in the war

338
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,399
in ukraine where allegedly this is just

339
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,560
me the information

340
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,880
russian troops were

341
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,600
tracking british um

342
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,440
mobile identities to to do artillery

343
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,600
strikes um

344
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,279
unclear how this was done could have

345
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,440
been done by hacking the mobile networks

346
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,160
but

347
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,880
theoretically you could do this even in

348
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,920
5g by just eavesdropping on the country

349
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,440
code and mobile network code

350
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,079
over there and then then you can see

351
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,639
where this and then with triangulation

352
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,399
you could see where these phones are

353
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,560
uh

354
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,639
3dpp has

355
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
also introduced started some new studied

356
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,920
studies

357
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,160
uh there's an ongoing

358
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,279
release 18 study it just started so

359
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,000
there's not much um

360
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,799
content in that study yet

361
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,880
and by the way you can find references

362
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,720
to a lot of information

363
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,079
at the end of this presentation um

364
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,720
so 3dpp has a lot of other identities

365
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,599
then

366
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,359
most of these are

367
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,599
temporary there's also a lot of

368
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
parameters in this

369
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,559
uh

370
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,120
this study was started by the academic

371
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,840
paper nori concealing the concealed

372
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,120
identifier in 5g written by me and a

373
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,039
colleague

374
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,760
which identifies that the variable

375
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,880
length nice leaked information with the

376
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,200
current encryption there is no padding

377
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,240
this will be one of the things the study

378
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,480
looks at but it will also it will take a

379
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,160
broad approach looking at all the

380
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,360
identifiers and and parameters looking

381
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
what an attacker can do by combining

382
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,600
different

383
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,080
identifiers or combining identifiers

384
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,160
with things like location or or time and

385
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,200
how an ident attacker the attacker in

386
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,160
question is supposed to use artificial

387
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,520
or intelligence or machine learning

388
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,799
so i think this is very good study

389
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,720
hopefully there will be

390
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,960
even if everything might not be fixed

391
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,080
now it will be stored and fixed later in

392
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
60.

393
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
the industry has

394
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,200
already started to look at what 60 will

395
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,440
be like and one of the study items that

396
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,960
we are studying right now is to look at

397
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,360
identifiers in the core network

398
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,840
haven't really

399
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,200
gone where got them very far in this but

400
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,679
the aim of the study is to take a broad

401
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,000
look look at all the identifiers and see

402
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,039
if there's

403
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,440
if there's any privacy

404
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,039
sensitive information that doesn't

405
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,520
really need to be there

406
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,840
the plan for 60 at least erickson's plan

407
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,799
is that privacy sensitive information is

408
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,160
sent on a

409
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,960
as needed basis and then deleted when

410
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,080
it's not needed

411
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,679
another thing i talked about in 2019 was

412
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,960
zero trust architecture inside and

413
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,400
between networks um

414
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,200
and i can happily report that this also

415
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
basically everything was

416
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,880
approved

417
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,600
at least inside the networks

418
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,840
so there is

419
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,440
tls1.3 between all the

420
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,760
nodes in this sba architecture

421
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,720
what to exactly use between the networks

422
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,880
which has been a major weakness in the

423
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,039
past with this ss7

424
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,200
attacks and so on it's still a bit

425
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
unclear this json interface that was

426
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,600
standardized

427
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
seems to be a little bit complex to

428
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,000
actually deploy so it might be replaced

429
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,360
with something

430
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,559
simpler like like plain tls tunnels but

431
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,159
that's still

432
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,559
a bit under discussion in gsm measures

433
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,840
several sdus involved in in stylization

434
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,880
mobile

435
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,440
networks

436
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,559
uh

437
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,039
thirteen also this that i presented in

438
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,640
2019

439
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,440
and

440
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,440
uh go back to the 2019 presentation if

441
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,200
you want more information

442
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,280
about what i discussed then um

443
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,760
so the problem here was that in the

444
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,840
snowden

445
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,679
revelations it was

446
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,960
allegedly

447
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
us and uk

448
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,840
intelligence hacked the sim

449
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,520
manufacturer yamato and stole a lot of

450
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,440
of the keys uh we don't know if that's

451
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
really happened but i guess we can

452
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
assume that it did

453
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
it doesn't really matter just that

454
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,960
the possibility that it happened

455
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,360
millions of billions of keys is bad

456
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,760
enough there's also the possibilities

457
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,640
that

458
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,000
some of this

459
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,240
there's collaboration between

460
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,400
vendors and and intelligence

461
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,280
so this was

462
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,240
erickson was proposing here that to

463
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,280
introduce divi helman to get so-called

464
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,360
forward secrecy

465
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,559
uh this was unfortunately declined

466
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,159
uh and

467
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,159
to summarize what you can do with this

468
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,559
this this is called what's called this

469
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,000
great sim heist in media

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,840
uh extension of is usually it's not very

471
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,440
known

472
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,240
but

473
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,080
the potential is this that is a disaster

474
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,440
um

475
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,600
according to media potentially billions

476
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,240
of secret keys were compromised what you

477
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,159
can do with these keys is that you can

478
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,000
impersonate the mobile phone you can

479
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,320
impersonate the network you can

480
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,200
passively eavesdrop on all

481
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,520
information to and you can track users

482
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,640
you can also

483
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880
connect users to a false base station

484
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,320
and inject malware all things discussed

485
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,000
in in media and all theoretically

486
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,320
true

487
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,960
we proposed ericsson proposed

488
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,799
to study this

489
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,640
existing authentication procedure

490
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,200
lacking pfs property was the name of

491
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,559
this

492
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,960
yesterday study and fortunately

493
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,320
he has to study this topic was objected

494
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,679
by companies from france uk and u.s

495
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,600
there was also strong support from

496
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,360
swedish finnish chinese german and u.s

497
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
companies

498
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,600
they're not really any technical reason

499
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,760
give them um

500
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,320
would not like to speculate in why these

501
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,840
companies

502
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,159
objected to study this i think you have

503
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,520
to ask them

504
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,880
yourself

505
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
but this is a very

506
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,960
current situation is very bad and i

507
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
think any

508
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,280
highlighting and discussion and making

509
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,760
this public whole discussion on this

510
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,200
topic is good i think

511
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,280
situation right now to use the words

512
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,159
from

513
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,039
keith martin is that there is

514
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,000
no authentication method in public 5g

515
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,440
with acceptable security norms

516
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,360
uh ericsson is currently driving the e

517
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,080
aka pfs standard in idf emu

518
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,720
but this is currently only

519
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,360
approved for use in private networks

520
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,600
we'll discuss a little bit what that is

521
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,080
later

522
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,440
so

523
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,679
the access authentication in 5d is

524
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,640
called primary authentication

525
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,120
5d networks comes in two different

526
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,919
flavors there are public 5d networks

527
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,200
these are the

528
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,279
mobile networks that you all know and

529
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,000
use every day these are the public

530
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,320
ones where you can as a private person

531
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,760
can sign up to

532
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,880
5d introduce also what is called private

533
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,840
5d networks these are meant for

534
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,799
use by single organizations like

535
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,200
industries or verticals they can be

536
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,320
completely standalone like the industry

537
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,559
is operating them without the help of a

538
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,279
mobile operator or there can be

539
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,000
many various degrees of interaction

540
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,799
between an industry and the current

541
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,158
mobile operator

542
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,279
and

543
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,559
another thing pointing out is that the

544
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,919
normal authentication in 5g is

545
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,480
is a using a using containing a

546
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,919
pre-shared key

547
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,720
and in media you often see the term sim

548
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,679
card

549
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,880
is not really accurate use them is an

550
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,840
application and it can be

551
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,760
implemented reside on a removable uicc

552
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,039
this is what

553
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,279
is typically referred to as a sim card

554
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,880
can also be on embedded uicc this is a

555
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,240
little ship that exists in most modern

556
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,640
phones and recently i've also been

557
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,559
approved that it can be implemented in a

558
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,039
trusted execution environment like

559
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,880
inside the cpu

560
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,120
of the phone

561
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,360
and these are all the authentication

562
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,400
methods that can be used in 5d and as

563
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,760
you can see

564
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,799
the ones

565
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,360
for public networks are not really

566
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,399
following best practice

567
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,400
also the current idf authentication

568
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,200
methods like

569
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,400
epls102 is is better but it's not really

570
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,360
good

571
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,440
tls103 was standardized just a few weeks

572
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,559
ago by itef it's already implemented and

573
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,159
with that and

574
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,039
ttls 1.3 which will hopefully be

575
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,360
standardized later this year then you

576
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,879
get the best practice

577
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,240
security and privacy meaning client

578
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,000
identity protection and forward secrecy

579
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
forward secrecy i would say is also a

580
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,320
must for so-called zero trust

581
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,559
um

582
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,520
so a little bit more about why you want

583
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,159
to use diffie-hellman and why forward

584
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,240
secrecy itself is not really enough

585
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,919
so there has been a lot of discussion

586
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,400
about forward secrecy in idf in recent

587
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,760
years

588
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,799
forward secrecy protects your keys from

589
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,360
compromise in one direction so if your

590
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,320
keys

591
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,679
key are compromised at time t to here

592
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,840
the attacker cannot

593
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,159
compromise any previous keys

594
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,559
on the other hand the attacker can

595
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,320
compromise all

596
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,279
future keys this is a good start but

597
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,679
it's not really yes it's not as good as

598
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,679
we can do

599
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,880
if you frequently do diffie-hellman

600
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,520
like every hour or so you get much

601
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,440
better protection then you get

602
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,159
protection from a passive attacher

603
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,640
passive attack attacker also in the

604
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,360
future as you can see here you have an

605
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,480
attack at t2 in this second picture here

606
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,600
and

607
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,799
all your previous and future keys are

608
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,000
secure against a passive attacker

609
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,679
using terminology from the excellent rfc

610
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,399
7625

611
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,080
for the secrecy

612
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
if you have forward secrecy an attack

613
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,279
you can still do static key exfiltration

614
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,520
that means that they they get the key

615
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,960
once and then they can use it for for

616
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,360
forever in the future they don't need to

617
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,640
extract any new keys doing frequent

618
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,760
diffie-hellman every hour or so forces

619
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,159
an attacker to do dynamic key

620
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,679
exfiltration or content exfiltration

621
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,840
and i would say that forcing attacker to

622
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,279
do this should

623
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,279
definitely be considered

624
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,240
best

625
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,559
practice

626
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,240
the reason for this is that this

627
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,000
increase the risk for the attacker to be

628
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,480
detected much much more they need to be

629
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,679
active

630
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,279
frequently like every hour or so

631
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,520
this rfc 7625

632
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,279
read that um

633
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,080
it's an excellent piece of uh

634
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,559
document unfortunately has not been used

635
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,960
very much in idefs it will reference

636
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,320
since it was published

637
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,320
another thing why you want to do

638
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,120
frequently hellman is to align with zero

639
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,919
trust principles

640
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,760
assuming breach

641
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,159
like key exfiltration is

642
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,080
an essential part of zero trust

643
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,600
summarized by these two statements here

644
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,080
zero trust assumes that breach is

645
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,480
invaluable or likely already has

646
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,600
happened this is a statement from nsa

647
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,000
and then from in some company

648
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,960
if breach occurs minimize the impact of

649
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,720
breach

650
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,679
and this

651
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,480
i would interpret this as

652
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,640
as forward secrecy is absolutely a

653
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,039
baseline requirement and frequent

654
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,720
development is probably what you need to

655
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,640
do to align with your trust principles

656
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,559
french government has had this as a

657
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,279
requirement from 2015 for ipsec

658
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,720
you and i require div helmet every hour

659
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,120
or every 100 gigabits

660
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,440
gigabytes i would say this should be

661
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,720
considered best practice for

662
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,039
for when possible for constrained iot

663
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,600
this is not really

664
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,880
possible

665
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,840
but ipsec is not really special this

666
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,919
should apply in general

667
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,320
if you're using the signal protocol this

668
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,799
is achieved by the double ratchet

669
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,840
algorithm

670
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,000
that is not really doing ephemeral

671
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,760
ephemeral different is doing something

672
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
called ephemera static diffie-hellman

673
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,360
but it's doing them in different

674
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,679
direction frequently and basically

675
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,880
achieves the same thing

676
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,000
so how is tls 103 doing in this aspect

677
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
actually not so good i would say um

678
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,399
tls 1.3 standardizes this psk key

679
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,080
key exchange method

680
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,799
and they made it look like it looks like

681
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,399
recommended it's actually recommended to

682
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,200
implement and not use but that's very

683
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,760
unclear

684
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,480
3dpp i have forbidden

685
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,880
everything without forward secrecy in

686
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,760
for

687
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,919
tls 1.2 and with the introduction on tls

688
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,039
103 this unfortunately got into 3dp

689
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,600
specs again and when i tried to forbid

690
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,760
it i got the reply from some company

691
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,640
that

692
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,399
we should not remove this because it's

693
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,880
recommended by the iaf

694
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,039
these things this might

695
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,679
see like a small technical

696
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,679
editorial thing but it has great

697
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,919
practical impact

698
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,720
i think idef needs to be much better as

699
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,600
marking everything that is weak as

700
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,640
not recommended i think idea sometimes

701
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,159
care way too much about companies

702
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,399
caring about their

703
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,799
what they have implemented even if and

704
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,120
don't want it to be not recommended even

705
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,519
if it's apparently is

706
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,159
all facts points to it being very weak

707
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,960
tls

708
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,559
the updated tls document will have some

709
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,960
consideration regarding frequent use of

710
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,159
dv hellmann uh i just got a pr approved

711
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,360
there

712
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,480
uh

713
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,519
a point with tls

714
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,399
quite a strict profiling to make it

715
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,760
secure

716
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,279
if tls 1.3 for example forbids the psk

717
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,000
key a key exchange and also for bids

718
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,360
cypher suits without confidentiality

719
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,679
so tls also removes the possibility to

720
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,120
do frequent

721
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,279
divi helmet in insider connection

722
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,519
if you want this in tls103 you need to

723
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,720
set up new connections that might be

724
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,519
simple in in some web applications but

725
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,760
in some other cases it's

726
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,000
can be very very hard

727
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,760
one example of this is dtls over http in

728
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,799
3dpp where setting up a new connection

729
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,399
would mean to

730
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,440
disconnect the cell tower for

731
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,960
for

732
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,600
for a long time all the phones connector

733
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,519
cells are reducing connection which is

734
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,399
like

735
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,240
not possible to do

736
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,519
uh

737
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,960
this leads to the dtls satp

738
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,799
specification even a complete rewrite

739
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,960
i would not be surprised if there are

740
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,519
more cases where setting up a connection

741
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,559
is is very problematic i think we will

742
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,840
see in the future

743
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,000
a new thing that is coming in 5d data

744
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,200
did not talk about last time is

745
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,240
authenticated encryption in the user

746
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,440
plane

747
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,039
so 2g only used unauthentic encryption

748
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,640
so encryption without any integrity

749
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,440
protection no authentication tag

750
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,919
at the end 3dm ford we introduced

751
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,039
authenticated encryption for the control

752
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,000
plane the 3d 3dp standards had two

753
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,239
different planes it's a user plane where

754
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,280
all your

755
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,040
if your web browsing it sends in the

756
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,480
user plane

757
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,960
but all the control messages are sent in

758
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,399
another plane

759
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,599
5d release 16 you have authenticated

760
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,599
encryption for also for the user plane

761
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,679
and this is not only needed to get

762
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,159
integrity protection authenticated

763
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,879
encryption is also used to get

764
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,839
best practice confidentiality

765
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,599
and protect against issues and

766
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,639
ciphertext attacks

767
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,000
but only use the plane most of the

768
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,280
information here is is already encrypted

769
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,359
at the application level using for

770
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,119
example https

771
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,760
or transport layer

772
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,640
here's an overview of the algorithms

773
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,839
used in

774
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,480
3dpp and

775
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,280
all all the weak algorithms you all

776
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,359
there's been a lot of media attention

777
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,800
about the algorithms in gpp at least

778
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,200
previously all the weak calories are

779
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,399
from the 2g generation

780
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,480
and everything from 3d and on this i

781
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,480
would say is strong and secure and 3dbp

782
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,119
and xsh are working on new

783
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,240
256 high performance software friendly

784
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,520
algorithms for

785
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,200
5g late definitely releases and 60.

786
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,960
pdp is also looking at a user consent is

787
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,040
also something that happens since 2019

788
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,119
and this is inspired by the european

789
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,760
gdpr law and other similar privacy laws

790
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,800
around

791
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,119
the globe that has very strict

792
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,040
requirements on

793
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,520
user consent for processing or storing

794
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,400
personal data

795
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,200
some applications in 5d use

796
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,720
of course use the data to do

797
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,560
to do different things such as

798
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,839
optimizing the networks or

799
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,960
some location services and so on

800
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,960
uh to the pps studies in tr 33 867.

801
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,560
it started consent in general to raise

802
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,079
awareness

803
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,800
on the operators also gives concrete

804
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,560
recommendations in in some use cases and

805
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,480
the overall conclusion in in 5g in 3dpp

806
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,839
is that user consent should be stored

807
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,160
with the subscription data this means

808
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,400
that any consent is given for the

809
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,280
for the subscription and then

810
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,680
anybody using that

811
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,680
subscription you could also think of

812
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,119
other things where for example the this

813
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,200
cookie law

814
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,240
when i'm browsing browsing the web in

815
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,440
at least in europe i need to accept

816
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,560
cookies

817
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,480
cookie pop-ups all the time i can say i

818
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,480
don't really read them i just try to

819
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,560
click them away so i don't think that's

820
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,520
very

821
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,560
good model either but of course there's

822
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,839
trade-offs here

823
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,480
and then you have a lot of references i

824
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,400
think that was

825
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,160
a little bit less than 30 minutes

826
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
hopefully we have time for some

827
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,440
questions if there are

828
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,200
uh

829
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,000
go ahead nancy

830
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,079
hello thanks so much for this excellent

831
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,119
presentation could you uh let us know on

832
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,599
which 3gpp mailing list the discussion

833
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,760
on pfs takes place because there are

834
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,839
many and not all are easy to follow so

835
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,000
could you perhaps point out what are the

836
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,680
best uh

837
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,400
lists to follow these discussions

838
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,520
yeah so this was any discussion here was

839
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,119
done on the essay 3 mailing list

840
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,240
i can send out uh you you need to be a

841
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,680
member of 3dp to subscribe to the lift

842
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,640
list but the mail archive is open and

843
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,760
public i can send out the link

844
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,880
to the hr pc email list

845
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,920
to the mail archive and then some things

846
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,560
are of course discussed during the

847
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,800
meetings at least before corona they

848
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
were discussed in face-to-face meetings

849
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,280
the meetings are not recorded and

850
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,720
sometimes the minutes are a bit uh

851
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,920
limited for the pfs discussion eriksson

852
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,720
was asking for a raise of hand

853
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,520
to to note which company objected to

854
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,040
introducing

855
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,280
pfs so that you can find

856
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,320
exact companies that was supportive and

857
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,119
objective to this you can find in the

858
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,520
meeting minutes that there is a

859
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,839
reference to in in the presentation

860
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,760
thanks so much for that answer and i

861
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,440
would really appreciate those resources

862
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,320
and thanks again for that uh overview

863
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,280
could you elaborate perhaps a bit more

864
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,599
on privacy but also other human rights

865
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,280
implications of

866
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,079
private 5g networks as well as edge

867
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,839
computing in 5g networks

868
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,520
private uh

869
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,280
private 5g network will only be used for

870
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,599
for industries i don't think there is

871
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,200
so many and most of these the devices in

872
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,839
these networks will probably be internet

873
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,520
of things

874
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,839
devices um

875
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,040
so i

876
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,200
don't think it will have so much human

877
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,640
rights implications and

878
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,920
i think and

879
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,880
the use cases will vary very very much

880
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,119
depending on industries i think if there

881
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,520
are any implications you need to

882
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
look at each industry

883
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,200
uh

884
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,640
in

885
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,000
as a special case um

886
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,760
don't remember there was some other

887
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,520
question

888
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,680
uh the comp the implications of edge

889
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,960
computing

890
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,200
uh it's computing um

891
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,560
i don't it will of course be uh

892
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,839
more

893
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,560
there will be some some information

894
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,240
available in in in the edge

895
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,280
in more

896
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,280
places but i think

897
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,839
with more than technology these are also

898
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,359
more

899
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,240
more protected on a hardware

900
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,640
level

901
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,880
one discussion is at least to use

902
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,160
trusted enclaves for edge computing but

903
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,040
what will actually be deployed in in

904
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,800
practice and when

905
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,720
um

906
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,160
i don't know but

907
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,359
there's

908
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,200
i think the risk is that more

909
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,680
information is spreading in more

910
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
notes but i think it can be done in a

911
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,960
secure

912
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,599
secure way

913
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,440
thanks so much this was really useful

914
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:32,800
um

915
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,480
if no one else is in the queue may i ask

916
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,359
in the follow-up question

917
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,119
well uh

918
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,560
oh there is someone in the queue so i

919
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,359
stopped hugging the mic sorry

920
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,920
um thank you

921
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,000
the way i understand it there is a lot

922
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,280
of slack in the definition of 5g with

923
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,680
some security and privacy features that

924
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,319
can be deployed or not

925
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,040
is there a worldwide survey of what is

926
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,160
the actual state of the deployment of

927
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,760
these techniques i mean

928
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,160
how many for instance are still really

929
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,119
using the poor algorithm and things like

930
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,880
that

931
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,000
uh

932
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,440
which algorith did you say in

933
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,680
you you mentioned that in it's still

934
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,560
possible to use poor uh encryption

935
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,760
algorithm in 5g but they're still

936
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,599
authorized but

937
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,960
my question was do we have an idea how

938
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,359
common it is to have this algorithm

939
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,319
no i

940
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,079
i think

941
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,079
i think that algorithm it's not so

942
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,599
common but i think

943
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,440
i don't think there's any public

944
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,880
resources that say how

945
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,560
how which operators globally is using or

946
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,240
not using

947
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,200
what i think that such a resource would

948
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,160
be

949
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,680
very

950
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,079
good uh would be it would be great if

951
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,880
somebody made such a website and

952
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,560
actually did that

953
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,599
research i think of course some of the

954
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,240
vendors might have some information was

955
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,880
a bit limited we know who we have sold

956
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,599
to but we might not know if they operate

957
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,000
to turn it on or or not

958
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,599
i think this may might have some service

959
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,640
but

960
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,839
not

961
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,400
i don't think csma has the

962
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,599
broad understanding of exactly

963
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,240
maybe for specific topic they might do

964
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,240
some internal service and so on but

965
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,040
these are typically not public either i

966
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,480
don't think they sit with all the

967
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,800
information but for example

968
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
one thing that would be interesting

969
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,520
right now is that where which operators

970
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,400
has

971
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,960
implemented and turn on this

972
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,440
sucky encryption of the mc that would be

973
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,560
maybe a

974
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,839
starting point there are some

975
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,359
researchers

976
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,680
doing um

977
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,760
doing some researching like encryption

978
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,079
algorithms and so on very soft often a

979
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,680
bit specific and it quite quickly gets

980
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,839
old if it's a 10 year old or 5 year old

981
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,480
paper it's not really up to date anymore

982
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,480
um

983
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,280
great um

984
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,720
i just had a question and then i think

985
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,440
we'll um move on to the next speaker but

986
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,319
um you had mentioned that you've uh

987
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,960
proposed some changes in tls are there

988
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,359
other places in the ietf any working

989
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,079
groups where um sort of actively

990
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,599
following discussion or others who are

991
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,839
interested in this work could also

992
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,000
subscribe to lists and follow

993
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,240
work

994
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,400
i think

995
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,240
it needs to be act

996
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,520
i think

997
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,400
good security and privacy affect all

998
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,440
idf

999
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,480
groups i think itafa had at least in tls

1000
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,119
there's maybe been a bit too much focus

1001
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:01,920
on

1002
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,880
forward secrecy and so my

1003
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,040
somebody that that will solve

1004
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,240
everything i think tls removed

1005
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,040
the possibility to do frequentify

1006
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,680
hellmann just when that started to

1007
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,319
become best practice in in the rest of

1008
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,400
the world but it might also be a little

1009
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,079
bit

1010
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,760
tls is maybe a bit too deb focused and

1011
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,800
don't always understand where it's used

1012
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,960
in other places and but that's awesome

1013
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,599
3d people started using tls much more

1014
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,920
for long-term connections

1015
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,720
at the same time as tls was developed so

1016
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,759
we should maybe have been

1017
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,040
active and then it might be possible

1018
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,200
it's a little bit unfortunate but

1019
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,200
you can't solve it by setting up new

1020
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,040
connections and if

1021
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,000
um

1022
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,119
i think tls is maybe one of the

1023
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,880
in a good

1024
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,640
position i think the problem is more

1025
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,880
when security is used in other groups i

1026
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,520
think there needs to be a

1027
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,599
constant focus to improve

1028
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,960
privacy

1029
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,319
and security

1030
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,359
everywhere

1031
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,599
itf is maybe doing the best in the in of

1032
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,480
all stos but there's still

1033
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,119
a lot of weaknesses in idf portugal that

1034
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,079
should be worked on

1035
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,359
wonderful

1036
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,400
um thanks very much john for joining us

1038
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,280
if there are other questions um it was

1039
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,839
just a very useful overview of of where

1040
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:38,640
that

1041
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,319
standard is at um from privacy um thank

discussion or information about

1045
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,119
5d networks and so on yeah and privacy

1046
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,040
fantastic thanks again

1047
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,680
um so yes checking our agenda

1048
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,560
as folks had noted before it has changed

1049
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,800
actually so the um

1050
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,520
items four and five only have 15 minutes

1051
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,079
for the drafts and we'll have 15 minutes

1052
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,119
then under aob for lenny to present on

1053
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,440
the ip blocking draft

1054
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,880
next up then

1055
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,079
is jacobo from witness who is going to

1056
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,400
be talking about content provenance and

1057
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,440
so go ahead um jocobo there is a button

1058
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,640
that looks like a document um on the on

1059
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,880
the top that you can click and then your

1060
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,319
slides

1061
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,640
should be available to you to load

1062
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,079

okay good morning everyone afternoon um

1067
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,920
so first just uh quickly apologize if

1068
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,559
you see me grappling for air i'm in

1069
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,040
quito ecuador for the first time in a

1070
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,280
couple of years and the air is very thin

1071
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,000
here we're almost at 3 000 meters above

1072
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,079
the sea level

1073
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,640
so my name is jacobo castillanos and i

1074
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,280
work with witness

1075
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,559
in the technology threats and

1076
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,400
opportunities program

1077
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,599
for context witness is a human rights

1078
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,040
organization that works with activists

1079
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,880
citizen journalists

1080
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,880
human rights defenders that use video

1081
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,839
and technology in crisis and conflict

1082
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,280
situations

1083
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,160
so

1084
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,520
for today um i'd like to talk to you

1085
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,599
about the harms modeling work that we've

1086
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,920
done within the c2pa so the con the

1087
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,599
coalition for content

1088
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,960
provenance and authenticity

1089
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,960
another a quick caveat also before

1090
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,359
starting witness is not

1091
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,040
an organization that works normally

1092
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,880
within standard development

1093
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,359
organizations so i appreciate the

1094
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,160
opportunity to speak here and get any

1095
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,400
thoughts or comments that you may have

1096
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,800
i work in the c2pa and i'll talk a

1097
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,720
little bit about more about that in a

1098
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,880
second it's just really informed by our

1099
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,400
previous work in

1100
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,839
content provenance and authenticity

1101
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,200
um so

1102
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,319
um

1103
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,640
let me

1104
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,040
hear this so for today i want to cover

1105
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,520
three uh topics as long as time permits

1106
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,440
so first just a quick background on

1107
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,280
witness and our work on providence and

1108
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,280
authenticity infrastructure

1109
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,839
the second is an overview of the c2pa

1110
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,760
and the specs

1111
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,920
and then the third thing and the bulk of

1112
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,440
the time on the harvest modeling work

1113
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,559
that's happened within t2pa

1114
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,240
so just to start off on the same page

1115
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,040
um i wanted to offer this

1116
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,559
general definition of provenance and

1117
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,000
authenticity infrastructure which is

1118
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,200
it refers to the tools the services or

1119
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,079
the frameworks that facilitate capturing

1120
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,640
processing and presenting information

1121
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,800
about the source and the history of

1122
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,800
digital assets in a way that is

1123
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,599
verifiable and tamper evident

1124
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,079
so here we have an image that comes from

1125
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,720
the c2pa but it's illustrative of the

1126
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,400
broader

1127
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,319
providence and authenticity ecosystem i

1128
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,119
think so we have here an image

1129
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,480
with its metadata and

1130
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,800
background information about the source

1131
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,000
of this image the history if um

1132
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
the size of the image was changed or the

1133
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,359
colors were altered for example uh this

1134
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,240
provenance uh information uh this

1135
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,599
province authenticity infrastructure

1136
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,599
refers to the tools that allow capturing

1137
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,119
this information and processing it

1138
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,240
so

1139
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,000
so a quick overview on witness

1140
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,520
so witness has been part of this work

1141
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,599
for a number of years now it's in many

1142
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,599
ways been pioneered by human rights

1143
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,359
organizations

1144
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,079
and so witness work with the guardian

1145
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,599
project on on proof mode which is an

1146
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,960
application

1147
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,680
that creates signed visual evidence with

1148
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,880
images and videos we've also

1149
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,960
researched and drafted this report that

1150
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,200
takes so it didn't happen report

1151
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,359
that pin points to

1152
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:14,240
14 key issues that should be addressed

1153
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,319
at an early stage which is where we

1154
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,160
still are now

1155
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,599
when thinking about providence and

1156
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,119
authenticity infrastructure instead of

1157
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,880
trying to deal with at a later stage

1158
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,359
once this has been deployed and and

1159
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:29,359
perhaps be more widely used

1160
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:30,880
so just to mention a couple of things

1161
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,800
that have come out of this previous work

1162
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,520
uh witness has been advocating for

1163
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,040
provenance and authenticity

1164
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,000
infrastructure to always be opt-in

1165
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,880
recognizing that there are reasons

1166
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,800
there are legitimate reasons for people

1167
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,680
not to want or not to be able to use

1168
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,680
these tools

1169
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,160
also thinking about privacy

1170
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,480
witness has been thinking or advocating

1171
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,280
for mechanisms of redaction of

1172
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,079
information so once this providence and

1173
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,920
authenticity trail of information is

1174
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,240
created what are the mechanisms by which

1175
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,319
information could be redacted and or

1176
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,720
sensitive information be

1177
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,480
protected

1178
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,280
so

1179
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,839
based on this work and also previous

1180
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,079
work with adobe's

1181
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,200
content authenticity initiative witness

1182
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,599
made the decision of being part of this

1183
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,319
uh

1184
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,839
uh of the c2pa this coalition

1185
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,599
um i think the next slide talks about

1186
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,359
the coalition

1187
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,160
no not yet but i'll explain i'll

1188
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,400
introduce the coalition in a second

1189
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,920
so

1190
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,240
one of the things that we have been

1191
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,280
seeing is that this uh provenance and

1192
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,920
authenticity infrastructure is moving

1193
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,720
from a niche from niche tools

1194
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,880
again that have been primarily pioneered

1195
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,040
by human rights organizations and it's

1196
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,599
starting to become

1197
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,520
more systematic efforts are starting to

1198
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,000
appear and these are led by you know the

1199
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,319
c2pa this coalition but also content

1200
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,640
authenticity initiative project origin

1201
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,880
which focuses on news media and it's

1202
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,000
been led by larger companies such as

1203
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,880
adobe microsoft bbc trooper amongst

1204
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,400
others

1205
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,599
and so as we have been seeing this uh

1206
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,920
just this shift from niche tools to more

1207
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,760
systematic use so witness has been um

1208
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,559
asking so as we see this shift how do we

1209
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,400
prevent how do we avert and mitigate

1210
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,359
harms

1211
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,280
and how do we enhance freedom of

1212
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,079
expression and trust

1213
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,920
and so this takes me to the c2pa

1214
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,160
so the coalition again the coalition for

1215
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,119
content

1216
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,680
provenance and authenticity is this

1217
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,000
group of companies primarily that have

1218
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,800
come together to create these technical

1219
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,079
specifications uh that

1220
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,800
are meant to create this interoperable

1221
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,119
ecosystem of capturing and processing uh

1222
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,400
authentication

1223
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,280
and provenance information so the c2pa

1224
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,040
is led by the companies that are listed

1225
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,720
here adobe arm bbc intel microsoft

1226
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,400
trooper twitter now also sony but there

1227
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,960
are over a dozen other general and

1228
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,880
contributing members and

1229
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,680
witness is one of these uh contributing

1230
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,559
members

1231
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,680
um

1232
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,040
as of january 26th of this year

1233
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,920
version 1.0 of these specifications have

1234
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,920
been published

1235
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,760
we are now heading uh in the coming well

1236
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,319
soon in the coming weeks perhaps uh

1237
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,839
going into version 1.0 of these

1238
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,520
specifications and so we're moving past

1239
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,280
the design stage and now into the

1240
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,040
implementation and the development of

1241
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,599
these tools

1242
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,280
so here i have a very quick overview of

1243
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,400
of the design of the specs uh this

1244
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,680
overview will by no means do it justice

1245
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,559
but hopefully it'll give a very general

1246
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,599
picture uh at least enough to go into

1247
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,040
the next part of the conversation which

1248
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,799
is the harms modeling

1249
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,040
so

1250
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,720
the way that

1251
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,920
these

1252
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,839
specs have been designed and i'm going

1253
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:16,960
to be using

1254
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,119
c2pa terminology here

1255
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,880
there are three actors

1256
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,799
in this example in this hypothetical

1257
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:23,839
example

1258
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,440
three actors are

1259
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,760
doing three different actions with three

1260
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,680
different c2pa enabled tools so here we

1261
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,799
have actor one that takes a picture say

1262
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,720
with a nikon camera

1263
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,520
the moment that this picture is taken

1264
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,319
a manifest is created as it is called in

1265
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,799
the c2pa um

1266
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,319
i don't know if you can see my cursor

1267
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,799
when i i think not but i'm pointing at

1268
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,079
the first uh the first column

1269
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,640
so this manifest includes

1270
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,520
certain metadata or assertions which in

1271
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,040
this case could include information

1272
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,880
about the location where the image was

1273
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,440
taken or the date that it was taken

1274
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,680
this information is cryptographically

1275
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,680
hashed to the image

1276
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,119
and then signed

1277
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,680
here by the signer which could be nikon

1278
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,960
or a third-party service

1279
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,559
i'm just getting a little bit ahead of

1280
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,200
myself here uh the trust model or the

1281
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,559
the the the way that the c2pa promotes

1282
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,040
trust is really tied to this signer

1283
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,079
right here the signer is a notary of

1284
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,160
sorts that vouches for the information

1285
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,400
that is included here

1286
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,480
designer cleveland it could be said that

1287
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,480
it's more than that really because the

1288
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,559
signer determines what information is

1289
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,480
included in these manifests and what

1290
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,079
information is not included for that

1291
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,760
matter

1292
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,799
so

1293
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,200
let's say we go to here to action 2 this

1294
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
picture now has been taken it includes a

1295
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,799
manifest it goes to actor 2 actor 2 is

1296
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,799
going to edit this image

1297
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,720
on photoshop

1298
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,880
the editor might change the color of the

1299
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,440
image or the size of the image thereby

1300
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,760
creating another manifest right here so

1301
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,480
like another little uh rectangle this

1302
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,640
information is cryptographically hashed

1303
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,880
to the image again and signed in this

1304
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,040
case it would be signed probably by

1305
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,520
adobe which is one of the

1306
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,119
steering committee members in these

1307
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:18,960
efforts

1308
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,799
and then the third

1309
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,599
actor would might publish it in the new

1310
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,599
york times

1311
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,160
the edit here the the publisher might

1312
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,400
compress the image out of captions

1313
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,960
this creates another

1314
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,760
uh manifest again cryptographically

1315
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,799
hashed and signed

1316
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,000
here the sign it could actually

1317
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,079
determine if all the manifests are

1318
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,079
included or just one

1319
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,720
but the point of this all is so that

1320
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,599
once

1321
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,000
uh it gets to the consumer the image or

1322
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,920
the video or the digital assets gets the

1323
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,280
consumer

1324
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,559
ideally

1325
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,799
they would be able to look at all of

1326
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,520
this provenance information

1327
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,319
and

1328
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,280
with that additional information be able

1329
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,000
to have a better sense of whether or not

1330
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,640
they will trust this image or they will

1331
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,000
decide to

1332
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,280
believe in it

1333
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,799
um

1334
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,160
before

1335
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,400
going past this quick summary i'll just

1336
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,680
highlight that the c2pa is not intended

1337
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,920
to determine what is true and what is

1338
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,359
not true

1339
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,240
it

1340
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,119
you know as it's established it merely

1341
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,599
gives this verifiable information

1342
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,920
additional verifiable provenance

1343
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
information so that consumers users

1344
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,240
could make more informed decisions about

1345
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,200
what they're consuming

1346
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,400
so

1347
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,680
with that

1348
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,520
quick overview

1349
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,559
i want to

1350
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:47,920
skip to

1351
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,240
witnesses involvement in this and how

1352
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,920
we've been thinking about

1353
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,599
bolstering a human rights framework

1354
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,920
around these specs

1355
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,680
we've had two

1356
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,359
main objectives i think it would be fair

1357
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,640
to say within the c2pa

1358
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,640
so for one thing uh we have been looking

1359
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,400
at the the design of the specs and

1360
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,799
thinking about the potential harms and

1361
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,480
how they could be prevented how they

1362
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,240
could be averted how we could mitigate

1363
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,839
uh harms

1364
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,880
and on the other hand we also

1365
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,960
see the authenticity and providence

1366
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,440
infrastructure uh bringing a lot of

1367
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,000
opportunities uh in you know from our

1368
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,920
perspective to human rights defenders to

1369
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,000
activists to journalists you know how

1370
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,480
could this help create more trustworthy

1371
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,520
content how could for example

1372
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,280
human rights defenders use this

1373
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,319
infrastructure to create visual evidence

1374
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,799
of human rights violations

1375
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,760
so how do we foster these usages

1376
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,839
so

1377
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,680
a witness being a general and

1378
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,240
contributing member of the c2pa we work

1379
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,839
mostly

1380
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,000
under the technical working group so the

1381
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,880
bottom purple box

1382
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,240
in a technical working group is where

1383
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,640
these specs are being designed and

1384
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,119
uh witness is the co-chair of the

1385
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,440
threats and harms task force where we

1386
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,599
have been leading the harms modeling

1387
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,799
efforts that i'll get to in a second

1388
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:15,040
however considering the broader

1389
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,040
objectives that we have

1390
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,280
we have also been uh

1391
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,400
informing the steering committee uh on

1392
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,440
various issues so perhaps uh most

1393
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,240
importantly at least at the start

1394
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,640
by establishing the guiding principles

1395
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,400
of the c2pa

1396
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,720
and i have another slide just to talk

1397
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,880
about the guiding principles because it

1398
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,599
really has set the foundations

1399
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,640
for the work on harm's modeling

1400
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,240
but beyond that also we've been

1401
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,960
having conversations on how to continue

1402
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,119
a harm's assessment

1403
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,760
beyond the the design stage or before

1404
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,319
1.0 and onto

1405
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,319
the next stages of these specifications

1406
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,079
and then also more broadly again

1407
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,920
thinking about how how we promote

1408
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,640
critical usages uh we've been having

1409
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,880
conversations about resourcing and

1410
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,520
supporting the creation of tools that

1411
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,240
are

1412
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,920
directly focused on

1413
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,400
human rights defenders journalists

1414
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,119
amongst others

1415
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,520
so

1416
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,119
as i mentioned the guiding principles

1417
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,520
really uh have been the foundation for

1418
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,599
the work that we have

1419
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,200
uh been doing

1420
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,319
um

1421
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,160
as mentioned we have not been working

1422
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,359
within standard development

1423
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,839
organizations so it's been unclear to us

1424
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,839
how at least from the start that it's

1425
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,440
been an evolution for us

1426
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,640
and a growth curve um

1427
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,760
but

1428
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,839
by having established these guiding

1429
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,520
principles from the start of having

1430
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,200
advocated for these guiding principles

1431
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,119
from the start it has really paved the

1432
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,599
way for the harness modeling work so

1433
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,799
when the c2pa was created a witness was

1434
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:02,000
advocating along with other companies to

1435
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,039
really think about privacy concerns so

1436
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:06,559
based on the report that i mentioned at

1437
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,119
the start for example we were really uh

1438
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,280
advocating for there to be redaction

1439
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,799
mechanisms um we were also thinking uh

1440
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,319
advocating for it

1441
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,920
for the specs to be designed thinking

1442
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,480
about global audiences so how could the

1443
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,839
specs be

1444
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,240
useful and pertinent and

1445
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,200
avert harm not just in

1446
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,319
in

1447
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,240
normally in europe or the united states

1448
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,000
but how it could be relevant in

1449
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,920
marginalized communities in africa or

1450
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,839
latin america

1451
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,240
how we could make sure that it be simple

1452
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,200
and not a cost burden and then perhaps

1453
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,559
most importantly

1454
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,760
that

1455
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,559
one of the principles be that the

1456
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,200
the standard the specifications be

1457
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,000
assessed for their capacity to result in

1458
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,559
harm or for their capacity to be misused

1459
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,640
or abused

1460
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,359
so i've i've numbered here a couple of

1461
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,319
principles i'll just read the first one

1462
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,640
t2pa specifications must respect the

1463
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,599
common privacy concerns of each of the

1464
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,599
target users

1465
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,520
onto the second point the

1466
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,480
second subpoint c2pa specifications must

1467
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,640
allow content creators editors and

1468
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,640
publishers to remove sensitive

1469
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,799
information before sharing with others

1470
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,720
and subsequent participants must be made

1471
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,039
aware of such removal

1472
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,760
c2pa specifications must not require

1473
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,400
identity of the person or organization

1474
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,960
making any assertion or claim about an

1475
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,880
asset to be documented the

1476
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,400
specifications may allow that

1477
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,319
information to be represented provided

1478
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,799
the representation is optional so here

1479
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,200
you know there's a list of other guiding

1480
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,400
principles

1481
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,359
as i was highlighting in this box um

1482
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,119
but here the second point i just want to

1483
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,599
emphasize on this point that again

1484
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,599
thinking about privacy that

1485
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,400
manifests never at least not

1486
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,280
not as at the standards level require

1487
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,359
individual identifiers to be connected

1488
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,599
to manifests

1489
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,640
so based on these guiding principles uh

1490
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,280
as i was mentioned witness has been

1491
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,240
leading this harm's modeling efforts

1492
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,599
which really has revolved around

1493
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,039
a harms misuse and abuse assessment

1494
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,200
that i'll explain the process in the

1495
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,359
coming and the next slides so there's

1496
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,640
been really three areas of work or faces

1497
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,240
if you will though they have been

1498
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,480
iterative um

1499
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,079
so on the one hand and this has been

1500
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,240
connected to the work with the twg with

1501
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,520
the technical working group and not just

1502
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,359
the threats and harms task forces well

1503
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:42,319
thinking about the purpose of of this

1504
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:45,119
infrastructure what are the use cases

1505
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,039
who are the users and also very

1506
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,760
importantly who are the stakeholders

1507
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,640
so with that foundation we went on to

1508
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,039
think about the assessment right so so

1509
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,280
what are the actual or the potential

1510
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,760
harms that could come that could result

1511
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,599
from um

1512
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,119
from these specifications and this

1513
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,799
systematic use of provenance and

1514
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,240
authenticity

1515
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,599
infrastructure

1516
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,839
and here i've just um

1517
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,640
mentioned that this assessment was very

1518
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,720
much inspired or it was adapted from

1519
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,960
microsoft's harms modeling framework so

1520
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,480
a taxonomy

1521
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,520
excuse me a taxonomy that um

1522
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,359
that frames the thinking around

1523
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,440
identifying potential harms

1524
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,760
and then the third area very importantly

1525
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,760
is thinking about mitigation strategies

1526
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,319
so so once we've identified these

1527
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,960
potential harms how we think these could

1528
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,599
be addressed

1529
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,680
there's two elements to this work that

1530
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,200
are very important to highlight first of

1531
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,960
all that it's ongoing and this is

1532
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,760
something that we've been

1533
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,240
repeating different

1534
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,319
instances that it's important that it

1535
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:52,480
start at the design stage it really it

1536
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,400
gives us a head start when thinking

1537
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,799
about human rights issues

1538
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,720
but it has to be continuous especially

1539
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,480
now that it goes into

1540
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,680
beyond 1.0 because it's starting to be

1541
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,280
implemented and tools are starting to be

1542
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,760
created and we're going past the realm

1543
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,400
of potential harms to actual harms so it

1544
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,240
has to be continuous

1545
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,240
and then the second is that the

1546
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,359
assessment

1547
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,599
has to include multi-disciplinary and

1548
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,359
diverse range of stakeholders um

1549
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,119
it's really important to think about how

1550
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,720
this could impact stakeholders and get

1551
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,960
ascendant and get them in being involved

1552
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,799
in these conversations uh to get a

1553
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,640
better sense of what the

1554
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,839
implications may be

1555
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,280
um yeah so i'll just

1556
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,039
explain this a little bit further so

1557
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,160
there's two

1558
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,119
uh

1559
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,200
areas where we've been having these

1560
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,240
discussions so on the one hand within

1561
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,559
the the c2pa within the technical

1562
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,079
working group and the threats and harms

1563
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,880
task force where as you may imagine

1564
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,920
there's a a group of experts mainly

1565
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,480
coming from tech companies and news

1566
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,680
media

1567
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,839
organizations

1568
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,200
that offer

1569
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,400
that offer

1570
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,280
their expertise and insight to get a

1571
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,480
sense of what the human rights

1572
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,000
implications are

1573
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,559
but also recognizing the limitations of

1574
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,599
this group the lack of representation

1575
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,760
and also the understanding of

1576
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,200
of broader society societal issues

1577
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,680
witness

1578
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,680
began an outreach process reaching out

1579
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,160
to as many folks as possible

1580
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,160
from different parts of the world

1581
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,799
with different lived technical uh

1582
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:35,920
professional

1583
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,880
experiences in order to get a sense of

1584
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,680
of how they think they thought that that

1585
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,200
this infrastructure could affect them

1586
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,599
how it could help them and and based on

1587
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,240
these uh conversations you know identify

1588
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,960
these harms and the potential

1589
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,599
mitigations

1590
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,319
so this is an overview of the results uh

1591
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,319
in the next slide i'll mention a couple

1592
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:01,039
of

1593
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,839
examples but uh to get an idea again and

1594
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,280
this is an adapted version of

1595
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,400
microsoft's harms modeling framework um

1596
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,799
the potential harms identified which is

1597
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,119
uh just under 60.

1598
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,119
there's different types of harms that

1599
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,880
have been identified not just because

1600
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,040
they fit under different categories but

1601
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,238
because

1602
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:22,479
some are very specific to

1603
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:25,839
the the impact that the c2pa could have

1604
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,719
others are more general about potential

1605
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,719
harms that could come from provenance

1606
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:32,399
and authenticity infrastructure starting

1607
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,319
with the fact that it's a

1608
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,000
data capturing system at the end of the

1609
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,759
day and then there are other harms that

1610
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,439
may not be directly connected to uh

1611
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:42,880
provenance and authenticity

1612
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,679
infrastructure or the c2pa uh that they

1613
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,158
may not be a result of this but they

1614
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,880
that they may be worsened or the issue

1615
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,600
may be deepened by the more systematic

1616
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,319
use of this of this

1617
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,080
infrastructure

1618
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,319
so there's been four categories of harms

1619
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,799
identified so for one

1620
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:05,198
denial of consequential services

1621
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:07,839
so we looked at the losses of

1622
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,679
opportunities how people could lose

1623
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,600
opportunities what are the economic

1624
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,399
losses that people could have

1625
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,198
coming out of the standards

1626
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,640
what are the infringements on human

1627
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,600
rights so how could people how could how

1628
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,600
it could affect people's dignity their

1629
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,759
liberty how can affect their privacy or

1630
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,040
their constraints on freedom of

1631
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,158
expression

1632
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:30,479
freedom of association and environmental

1633
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,479
impact

1634
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,560
would there be an erosion of social and

1635
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,560
democratic structures would there be

1636
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,120
manipulation uh here we saw questions

1637
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,759
around miss and this information uh

1638
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,600
could there be an over reliance on

1639
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,158
technical systems or any other social

1640
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:47,198
detriment

1641
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:49,120
and then lastly risk of injury so

1642
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,679
emotional or psychological distress or

1643
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,040
physical harm

1644
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,800
so the number that accompanies each one

1645
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,080
of these uh

1646
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,080
refers to the

1647
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,840
the potential harms identified

1648
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,760
um i'll i'll mention a couple of

1649
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,719
examples here in the next slide um

1650
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,880
so one of these one of the things that

1651
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,400
could come out of

1652
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,880
the c2pa

1653
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,960
and we recognize that this is

1654
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,960
these are only technical specifications

1655
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,440
yet uh once you go into the tooling this

1656
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,520
harms modeling work could be even more

1657
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,560
uh at least directly relevant but by

1658
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,719
thinking again from the standards level

1659
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,640
we we feel like we can get a head start

1660
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,000
and and also inform the actual specs so

1661
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,920
one of the harms that could come out of

1662
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,280
the cgpa is a redux a reduction in

1663
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,560
options for anonymity and pseudonymity

1664
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,360
so

1665
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,159
we

1666
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,040
based on how the the specs are designed

1667
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,280
uh we feel that

1668
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,800
for one thing there is a possibility for

1669
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,080
um

1670
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,800
for people to inadvertently uh share

1671
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,239
sensitive information um and this refers

1672
01:10:58,239 --> 01:10:59,679
back to questions around the user

1673
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,600
experience you know so what if the specs

1674
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,120
have been designed to allow for

1675
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,199
confidentiality but what if the user

1676
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,960
experience is not uh

1677
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,800
designed in such a way that it really

1678
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,480
allows the user to

1679
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,520
maintain control of that um

1680
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,719
and then there's also the questions

1681
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,880
around the the fact that although the

1682
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,360
specs allow for confidentiality

1683
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,560
they don't uh demand it you could have

1684
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,960
compliant uh tooling that does require

1685
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,920
individual uh identifiers

1686
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,840
and so that takes us

1687
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,199
that takes me actually to the second

1688
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:35,520
point that the c2pa could result on

1689
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,760
attacks on journalistic freedoms and

1690
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,600
independence

1691
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,480
so

1692
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,400
again if the c2pa is abused

1693
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,480
in countries where there's no checks or

1694
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,679
or control on government surveillance

1695
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:52,640
and

1696
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,960
laws are enacted that require individual

1697
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,199
identifiers to be attached to manifests

1698
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,880
of images and videos published by

1699
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,520
journalists then this could really have

1700
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,600
a negative impact on on freedom of

1701
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,800
expression

1702
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,120
and the third example here that i'll

1703
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,679
mention is requiring participation in

1704
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:11,760
the use of technology or surveillance to

1705
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,719
take part in society so

1706
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,679
for example what if the c2pa is

1707
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,480
implemented in social media platforms

1708
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,880
and the further down the line social

1709
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,280
media platforms decide that um

1710
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,480
images and videos that contain manifest

1711
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,199
c2pa manifests or contain provenance

1712
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,840
information have a higher algorithmic

1713
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,640
ranking than those that don't then there

1714
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,880
are questions about well what happens to

1715
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,480
those that again as we men as i

1716
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,360
mentioned earlier to those that decide

1717
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,199
for legitimate reasons that they do not

1718
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,360
want to use uh this providence

1719
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,719
infrastructure or that they can't

1720
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,000
because they just don't have access to

1721
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,719
it

1722
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,960
um so these three are just examples of

1723
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,000
the potential harms that that have been

1724
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,360
identified

1725
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,560
um

1726
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,040
and then and then this is connected to

1727
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,600
certain to some uh mitigation strategies

1728
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,800
but uh

1729
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,640
there are others that there's still gaps

1730
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,840
that that witness and and the c2pa uh

1731
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,640
are working on and i'll actually just in

1732
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,480
the interest of time

1733
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,280
uh i'll skip these two slides which talk

1734
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:22,320
about specific more specific harms and

1735
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,199
jump to this one right here

1736
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,239
um so all of this information that i

1737
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,719
have been sharing with you has been

1738
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,320
published alongside the specs so if you

1739
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,040
visit the website c2pa.org and go into

1740
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,880
the specifications

1741
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,239
tab

1742
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,400
you'll find that along with the actual

1743
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,120
specifications there a list of other

1744
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,640
documents that have been published with

1745
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,000
the specs so

1746
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,440
one of them is the security

1747
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,440
considerations one is user experience

1748
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,960
consideration

1749
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,520
another is guidance for implementers and

1750
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,840
there's the harms modeling work

1751
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,080
and so in that harm modeling document

1752
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,000
you'll find detailed information about

1753
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,040
the the process that it was carried out

1754
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,760
and

1755
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,360
you'll also find

1756
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,520
this table right here this is just a

1757
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,560
snapshot of that table and this includes

1758
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,480
all of the the potential harms that have

1759
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,159
been identified they've been categorized

1760
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,159
they've been described and

1761
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:23,040
with a contextual example and then uh

1762
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,880
most importantly perhaps

1763
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,600
tied to a specific existing and

1764
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,520
potential

1765
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,600
mitigation

1766
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,320
so

1767
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,360
uh i'll end with this last slide right

1768
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,800
here on existing and potential

1769
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,719
mitigations so the outputs of our harms

1770
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,440
modeling work so based on on on the

1771
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,280
assessment and based on the potential

1772
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,000
harms that have been identified uh what

1773
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,920
witness has been doing as co-chairs of

1774
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,400
the threatened harms task force is

1775
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,360
to inform and shape these three areas of

1776
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,080
the c2pa so first and and most

1777
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,239
notoriously the actual specifications of

1778
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,400
course so that the specifications in

1779
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,239
their design they already include all of

1780
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:05,920
these considerations around privacy

1781
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,239
accessibility uh misuse etc

1782
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,320
the second area are the accompanying

1783
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,360
documents that i mentioned before so

1784
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,280
based on this harm assessment what does

1785
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,280
the user experience guidance need to

1786
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,320
include

1787
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,800
so here for example we just emphasized

1788
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,199
on the need for there to be guidance for

1789
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,920
content creators uh or also for

1790
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,760
consumers but also for content creators

1791
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,000
to be able to to know what information

1792
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,679
they're sharing and and how the

1793
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,520
information is being shared

1794
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,520
what the rejection redaction mechanisms

1795
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,199
are etc

1796
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,920
what are the harms considerations that

1797
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,719
should be offered to implementers as

1798
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,199
they build these tools

1799
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:48,880
and then another

1800
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,199
big one that witness advocated for was

1801
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,679
an explainer

1802
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,280
so

1803
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,480
very often

1804
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,719
these

1805
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,960
standards development groups are not

1806
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,600
necessarily very very representative

1807
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,600
so how could we get more people to know

1808
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,440
about what's happening how we could get

1809
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,760
more input and so to that end an

1810
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,000
explainer is has been drafted and

1811
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,840
published and this is

1812
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,800
is to be continuously uh updated

1813
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,159
and then the third area uh that that

1814
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,480
is affected by the work that that

1815
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,920
witness has been doing are the

1816
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,560
non-technical and multilateral harms

1817
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,159
response actions

1818
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,560
uh so for one thing as mentioned before

1819
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,320
this includes thinking about resourcing

1820
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,040
and supporting a diverse c2pa ecosystem

1821
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,120
right so so the specs have been designed

1822
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,120
how do we now create the tools that

1823
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,440
actually human rights defenders will use

1824
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,520
in conflict zones how do we use how do

1825
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,679
we create the tools that citizen

1826
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:48,000
journalists might use in countries where

1827
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,880
you know there might be a lot of

1828
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,840
government surveillance uh we've

1829
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,840
started to think about uh about the

1830
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,239
governance of the c2pa uh we're not

1831
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,000
steering committee members so it's it's

1832
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,840
a tricky area but mostly around

1833
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,640
questions around the red flags what are

1834
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,640
the really compliance issues that we

1835
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,480
need to think about should they be

1836
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,719
addressed within the c2pa or beyond

1837
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,960
where we're thinking that this

1838
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,760
compliance should go beyond the c2pa not

1839
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,120
part of this youtube but then how does

1840
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,199
that look like or what is that what does

1841
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,360
that look like and then lastly this

1842
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,040
ongoing assessment that i mentioned

1843
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,880
before um

1844
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,600
i hope that i've that i've stayed within

1845
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,800
my time frame uh mallory but um

1846
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,760
i'll leave it open for their questions

1847
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,600
thanks so much excellent excellent

1848
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,320
presentation um we've got folks joining

1849
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,840
the queue there were lots of really good

1850
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,679
questions in the chat which i hope you

1851
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:42,960
weren't paying attention to as you

1852
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,560
presented but um

1853
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,960
why don't we go and take patrick in the

1854
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,199
remote queue and then we've got a couple

1855
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,759
people at the mic

1856
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,679
we can't hear the mic in the room meet

1857
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:05,000
echo folks

1858
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,679
hello can you hear me

1859
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,640
yes yeah okay hello uh i'm patrick uh

1860
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,719
tarpy from ofcom uh it's very

1861
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:21,760
interesting

1862
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,440
presentation thank you

1863
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,760
uh just a query here

1864
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,920
imagine a scenario say i don't know 10

1865
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,600
years in the future

1866
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,800
and the metadata isn't available

1867
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,159
for a piece of content just to verify

1868
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:37,679
its providence

1869
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,159
would we be looking at a situation say

1870
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,239
future researchers or people doing legal

1871
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,679
research or whatever

1872
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:45,520
if it can't be verified

1873
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,600
it then has a kind of like a secondary

1874
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,840
status in terms of the

1875
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,920
and you know ultimately who pays for i

1876
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,600
know i'm kind of combining two questions

1877
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,760
but that's the you know how will this

1878
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,440
sustain itself i guess really it's a

1879
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,239
great idea thank you

1880
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,920
yeah so

1881
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,360
so this

1882
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,280
top or two-tier

1883
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,600
issue is is really

1884
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,960
one of the things that witness has been

1885
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,040
thinking about and and then i believe

1886
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,640
your comment refers to uh legacy media

1887
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,239
perhaps we could say so what happens to

1888
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,520
the media that was created pre uh

1889
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,679
pre-content uh authenticity and

1890
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:24,239
provenance um yeah there's questions

1891
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,920
around that so so

1892
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,280
in the design of the specs there's

1893
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,000
something called an update manifest

1894
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,040
so it is possible to include uh

1895
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,840
provenance information

1896
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,760
in work in digital assets that were

1897
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,440
created beforehand

1898
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,560
obviously

1899
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,320
the information that would be contained

1900
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,000
within these manifest would say well

1901
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,080
this was created before and then if you

1902
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,400
trust the signer as i mentioned this all

1903
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,560
revolves around designer if you trust a

1904
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,520
signer that created this uh uh

1905
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,520
manifest then you might be tempted to

1906
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,600
say okay you know even though this was

1907
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,320
created after uh the the moment after

1908
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,280
the fact that the image was taken

1909
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,120
i decide that i'll believe in it because

1910
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,719
it was signed by the designer that i

1911
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,120
choose to believe in um

1912
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,880
even then i think there's still issues

1913
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,199
that need to be addressed and and uh for

1914
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,639
us

1915
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:16,560
one of the most concerning areas one of

1916
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,639
the areas that we want to work on is not

1917
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,639
just for legacy media but what happens

1918
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:22,800
to again people that for legitimate

1919
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,400
reasons cannot uh or or do not want to

1920
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,880
use uh providence information

1921
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,880
and then the second question has to pay

1922
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,239
for this

1923
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,639
so the coalition is is organized by

1924
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:36,639
these companies and they're building

1925
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,440
these specifications the actual tooling

1926
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,159
will

1927
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:42,800
depend on whoever wants to create these

1928
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,280
tools and be part of this ecosystem and

1929
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,280
there on that on that note witness is

1930
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,960
thinking okay well how do we create

1931
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,199
tools for the people that we work with

1932
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:52,480
for our constituents human rights

1933
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,920
defenders activists and journalists and

1934
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,920
there there's a big question there too

1935
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,440
and it's something that will hopefully

1936
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,600
work with the c2pa but also beyond the

1937
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,239
c2pa

1938
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,400
great so stephen you were in front of me

1939
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,799
go ahead

1940
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,120
um

1941
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,679
i have a technical question which may be

1942
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,679
actually a political one

1943
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,360
when someone uh

1944
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,000
modify a picture with photoshop for

1945
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,120
instance

1946
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,120
uh how are people supposed to verify the

1947
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,000
close i mean how do you get

1948
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,400
the public key of the person modified

1949
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,280
which is

1950
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,280
certainly the most difficult problem in

1951
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,920
cryptography so is it covered by the

1952
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,199
specification or

1953
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,000
how do you verify the identity of the

1954
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,400
signer is that the question no i would

1955
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,719
how do i get the public key

1956
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,320
the guy modifies the picture he signs

1957
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,040
with

1958
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,280
his private key i assume

1959
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,679
so how do you get the public key to to

1960
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,960
check the signature

1961
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,679
and of course how can you be sure that

1962
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,600
it's a correct public key

1963
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,199
a typical hard problem

1964
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,040
so

1965
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,080
so the the specs inc

1966
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,239
they're tied to the

1967
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,960
they're connected to the use of of

1968
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,360
certificate authorities that verify the

1969
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,840
identity of the signer but on the public

1970
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,239
key aspect to be honest i can't tell you

1971
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,159
that i don't i don't work on the

1972
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,159
technical side of this um

1973
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,360
so i can't tell you i'm sure there's a

1974
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,040
very easy answer to that but i can't

1975
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,639
answer that

1976
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,880
because it may turn into a big political

1977
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,520
problem because who will issue the key

1978
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,199
we keep the keys etcetera etcetera

1979
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:45,280
i'm actually taking note of this and

1980
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,520
hopefully i'll be able to answer this to

1981
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,760
you very shortly if i can reach out to

1982
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,840
you somehow but um

1983
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,719
thanks and we can also drop the link to

1984
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:57,520
the

1985
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,480
the version one spec which is published

1986
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,080
um the white paper i think that might be

1987
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,440
useful

1988
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,600
um i put myself in the queue actually

1989
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,360
because i okay um

1990
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,280
i think i i've heard

1991
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,800
the response for this before but just

1992
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,360
wanted to verify if you are currently

1993
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,880
working or other folks from the

1994
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,639
technical working group are currently

1995
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:17,920
working on

1996
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,600
um standards i think that there's an iso

1997
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,639
group maybe that deals with um image

1998
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:25,679
data

1999
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,719
that may be impacted by

2000
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,400
this

2001
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,040
this design

2002
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,719
so if there's more folks that are

2003
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,480
working other standards developed

2004
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,000
organizations

2005
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,080
yeah

2006
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:45,120
yeah so so i yeah i mean i i can't speak

2007
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,320
for

2008
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,920
what other people do really but i know

2009
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,560
that the chair uh leonard hofstadter

2010
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,320
works in various uh

2011
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,400
standards development with uh

2012
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,040
jpeg i believe and then

2013
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,960
the iptc there's folks that have been

2014
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,840
working closely with iptc

2015
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,000
um but yes i i know there are but i

2016
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,560
can't mention specifically no no worries

2017
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,800
and actually the main question i i was

2018
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,320
so i compared this in my mental model to

2019
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,880
um website certificate authorities or

2020
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,280
domain subjects authorities and one of

2021
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,920
the stop gaps in abuse

2022
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,159
that we've seen enacted in the current

2023
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,639
ukraine russia situation for example is

2024
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:25,440
um

2025
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,360
certificate authorities not being

2026
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:30,080
recognized by the browsers

2027
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,480
um and and that being again like a

2028
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,600
measure to ensure um there's no abuse of

2029
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,480
the trust system and i'm just it's maybe

2030
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,400
a comparable question to what stefan

2031
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,880
just asked which is i don't

2032
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,639
have like what would be the equivalent

2033
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:45,840
then of

2034
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,800
say you know a c2pa

2035
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,920
certificate authority issuing assurances

2036
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,239
um was doing so on bad faith like how do

2037
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,400
you kind of stop

2038
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,719
those verifications from entering into

2039
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,199
the ecosystem like is it through the

2040
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:02,639
software developers that are

2041
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,320
implementing it is it through the

2042
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,880
publishers who are

2043
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,480
publishing it is there um

2044
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,159
how does that work or do you have to be

2045
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:14,000
part of the coalition

2046
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,239
to be able to be a ca

2047
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:18,879
just wondering

2048
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,560
uh no so so the

2049
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,880
the specifications have

2050
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,080
uh a segment on trust lists

2051
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,679
and there's no

2052
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,280
there's not much guidance and trust us

2053
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,960
because once uh you start creating uh

2054
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,560
parameters for what's trusting and

2055
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,880
what's not then it opens a can of worms

2056
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,320
and then considering that this has so

2057
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,760
many uh

2058
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,840
uses in so many different industries

2059
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,719
then it's hard to define uh who is

2060
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,480
accepted and who's not part of this

2061
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,719
trust list so all it says in terms of

2062
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:53,280
guidance to that end is that

2063
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,760
claim generators so these cr

2064
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,480
those that create these uh manifest

2065
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,000
uh maintain certain uh trustless of

2066
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,239
certificate authorities that they work

2067
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:04,960
with

2068
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,480
and that they accept

2069
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,600
for signing these manifests i don't know

2070
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,120
if that answers the question mallory

2071
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,960
yeah yeah i mean i think it's something

2072
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,040
maybe to be further explored because i

2073
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,880
do think that there's on the one hand

2074
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,040
like the trust which could be about

2075
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,760
content it could be about identity like

2076
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,360
that's kind of a thorny issue that's

2077
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,440
harder to resolve but then there's the

2078
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,080
issue like if you've got an actor in

2079
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,920
your space who is acting in bad faith or

2080
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,760
not you know

2081
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,280
doing the right thing i mean that should

2082
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,760
also be actionable right so that that

2083
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,840
entity is no longer sort of accepted in

2084
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,280
the ecosystem and

2085
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,719
in the in the so so anyway that's um

2086
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,560
it's a difficult one for sure but i

2087
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,639
think that'll probably need to be

2088
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:52,800
addressed at some point

2089
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,880
yeah and that's the to the compliance

2090
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,880
issue that that we've been thinking

2091
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,000
about yeah

2092
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,120
we're very open to that client

2093
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,839
okay nick

2094
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,560
center for democracy and technology uh

2095
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,480
thank you so much for this presentation

2096
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,280
i have

2097
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,880
i have lots of questions that i'm not

2098
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,760
going to i'll ask right now i'm kind of

2099
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,280
curious just about this

2100
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,440
more sort of uh process thing including

2101
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,199
this slide that you're showing right now

2102
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,440
i really like this idea of using uh

2103
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,320
explainers of the idea that not everyone

2104
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,080
is going to understand all the

2105
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,000
specifications or not everyone is going

2106
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,120
to be able to participate that's just a

2107
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,760
fact at the moment um and that's

2108
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,880
something we also face with itf and w3c

2109
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,360
other technical standards bodies

2110
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,040
uh and so i am curious about this idea

2111
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,880
of explainers and i would just i would

2112
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,480
just be curious to hear if you've heard

2113
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,000
from people who have

2114
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
used those explainers or other groups

2115
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,840
that were interested but weren't um

2116
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,920
actively participating have you gotten

2117
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,080
any feedback about oh because of the

2118
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,760
explainer i understood how this worked

2119
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,520
or i had this question or i had this

2120
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,880
concern

2121
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,800
do you have any examples of how those

2122
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,360
have gotten used

2123
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,000
yeah so first i think the

2124
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,159
i'm not sure where the idea of the

2125
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,440
explainer came from i don't know if this

2126
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,360
is standard i actually would love to

2127
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,600
know if creating explainers is part of

2128
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,040
the standard within a standard

2129
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,520
development organization um but i but at

2130
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,679
least the idea of it is tied to this too

2131
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,120
much of the work that many of you may be

2132
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,600
involved with and and the notion that

2133
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,719
that sdos are not very representative so

2134
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:34,000
on that with that context the the idea

2135
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,400
of creating an explainer was it was very

2136
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,880
important uh from witnesses perspective

2137
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,760
um and and the way that the explainer is

2138
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,520
drafted and it's something that you

2139
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,639
could check it's hopefully very

2140
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:48,000
um

2141
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,159
very open and and very

2142
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,400
accessible to the general public to

2143
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,440
people that have no idea about sdos and

2144
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,920
have no technical background whatsoever

2145
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,520
so that is the way that it has been

2146
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,520
drafted uh hopefully that's the way that

2147
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,480
it's been it's been read

2148
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:08,639
when we present the c2pa to folks

2149
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,159
that are not part of these uh

2150
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:12,320
environments they have pointed to the

2151
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,120
explainer to say you know because we

2152
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,199
read the explainer we get a better sense

2153
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,760
of what this is for sure uh the fact is

2154
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,199
when you look at the specs it's just

2155
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:23,360
very very overwhelming it's very very

2156
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:26,880
technical and definitely not uh

2157
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,840
not it's not it doesn't invite people to

2158
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,520
comment on them and the explainer has

2159
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,440
been and they have we've had several

2160
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,239
people mention that uh nick uh that this

2161
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:39,040
is their access to this um to these uh

2162
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,600
discussions

2163
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:47,040
that's like uh really admirable and and

2164
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,560
i'm i'm kind of excited that you do have

2165
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,040
some at least some positive feedback

2166
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,960
maybe maybe we can try that in some

2167
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,360
other settings to have that more human

2168
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:58,080
readable version

2169
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,639
excellent

2170
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:05,199
thank you again so much for joining us

really nice to hear about this and and

2173
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,639
i'm glad you brought it to hrpc for

2174
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,400
folks to reflect on so you can always

2175
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,000
contact um

2176
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,080
each other on if anybody has questions

2177
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,080
on on the mailing list or through email

2178
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,679
so i encourage folks that still have

2179
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:22,239
lingering questions to to do that so

2180
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:26,000
thanks again for joining us yeah

2181
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,560
okay

2182
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,080
i

2183
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,880
will um i will not pull up the agenda

2184
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,159
again um if i remember correctly

2185
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:39,120
um we have the draft guidelines to

2186
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,639
present so

2187
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:44,159
um grad if you are ready

2188
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:46,719
you can come on up

2189
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:49,719
virtually

2190
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,480
okay

2191
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,400
are you able to load your slides or

2192
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,719
would you like me to control them okay

2193
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:58,960
good

2194
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
thanks

2195
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,320
perfect and uh if someone can help take

2196
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,239
notes during this part that would be

2197
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:09,040
great

2198
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,320
um

2199
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,560
so yeah uh this is a quick update on

2200
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,199
where uh draft guidelines is

2201
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:17,679
um

2202
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:20,639
so uh just to recap for folks who

2203
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:22,639
haven't uh who don't know about the

2204
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:24,000
document it's

2205
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,360
it's an update to rfc 8280 which

2206
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,280
uh talked about generally uh guidelines

2207
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,360
for assessing how a protocol or

2208
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,080
specification affects human rights and

2209
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,920
this is updating the guidelines part in

2210
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,400
that document

2211
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,880
and and we hope that it so it is based

2212
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,960
on practice in the sense that we've had

2213
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,800
some practical experience like people

2214
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,960
applying and assessing

2215
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,800
uh standards with these guidelines and

2216
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,719
helping us improve them

2217
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:53,679
and

2218
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:56,159
it's also written in a way that you can

2219
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,400
hopefully you can easily use them to ask

2220
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,320
questions of the protocol that you're

2221
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,000
designing or assessing

2222
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:02,880
uh

2223
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,520
currently the document is at its 12th

2224
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,440
version of

2225
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,320
after the last meeting the two

2226
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,719
major things have been that it was moved

2227
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:14,960
from last call to irtf chair review

2228
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,920
which happened thanks uh for the

2229
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,080
detailed review this feedback was

2230
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,960
addressed in january and

2231
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,560
you may see some changes in the

2232
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,080
structure the sections have been

2233
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,840
reordered and

2234
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,400
the changes are too uh

2235
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,199
the

2236
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,120
changes in the content are too numerous

2237
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,600
to detail now but uh

2238
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,320
if you like that list i can send send a

2239
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,639
link in the chat where uh

2240
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,159
i mean at least the list not not a

2241
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:43,120
summary

2242
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,880
um

2243
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:45,760
so

2244
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,600
uh

2245
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,080
in uh now i get to the part where i'm

2246
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,480
stating mostly my opinion of how i see

2247
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,639
things so i i think we've addressed most

2248
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,639
of the feedback that has come on the

2249
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:59,840
list uh there is one part that

2250
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:00,719
uh

2251
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:03,040
may may still seem a bit controversial

2252
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:06,080
which is the the section on attribution

2253
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:09,199
uh my personal assessment is that we

2254
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,360
we've had some requests of making minor

2255
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,120
changes to that section but i think

2256
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,199
we've uh

2257
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:17,679
labored it on quite so long that

2258
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,000
i don't see any serious objection to it

2259
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,400
but any modification

2260
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,800
invites serious objection so i'm i'm

2261
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,880
quite happy with what the current text

2262
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,800
is which is that

2263
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,360
it's advising against attribution and

2264
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,239
protocols it's saying

2265
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:37,920
that overall uh privacy security and

2266
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,639
censorship resistance and anonymity and

2267
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:43,040
pseudonymity are values in conflict with

2268
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,120
attribution and it's advising against it

2269
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,800
for now so

2270
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,719
uh personally i suggest not making any

2271
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,800
further changes to this section

2272
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,960
um

2273
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,880
yeah so i i

2274
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,480
for

2275
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,320
now uh

2276
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,320
i actually would love to hear from

2277
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,560
mallory or if colin is in the room as as

2278
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,280

2283
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,400
i i'm not sure i can do this

2284
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,920
through the meeting of interpretive

2285
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,320
dance like uh niels did

2286
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,000
but

2287
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,400
uh so um

2288
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:44,000
thank you um for um

2289
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,280
uh updating the draft and um

2290
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,400
taking uh my concerns into your account

2291
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,360
so i

2292
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,360
i see you you've

2293
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,360
put put a lot of effort into this and

2294
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:58,159
there's been a a lot of changes made and

2295
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:02,480
it appreciate the work you put in here

2296
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,718
um

2297
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,080
sorry i'm just trying to to uh juggle

2298
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,600
windows here um wait for the

2299
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,880
um

2300
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,679
comments on remedy and attribution which

2301
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,000
i think you mentioned on your previous

2302
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,639
slide um

2303
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,960
i mean that this this is clearly

2304
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,600
an area where um

2305
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,119
that there's been some difficulty

2306
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:32,080
reaching consensus in in the group

2307
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,760
um

2308
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:34,639
and

2309
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:35,840
um

2310
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,080
you know i i'm i'm certainly not a human

2311
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,400
rights expert and and i don't understand

2312
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,159
that the legal aspects here so i'm not

2313
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:45,199
going to push hard on this

2314
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:50,159
as a protocol designer though um i i

2315
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:52,239
sort of struggle to see what that

2316
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:55,280
section is getting at

2317
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,920
i i don't know if you know i i suggested

2318
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,080
an example as a way of helping me

2319
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:03,360
understand what that meant and um maybe

2320
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,520
that's that's difficult to provide and

2321
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,600
maybe there's um

2322
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,360
some other clarification that might be

2323
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:12,000
possible and maybe you know maybe we

2324
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,520
just have to accept that that section is

2325
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,480
just

2326
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,360
you know

2327
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,600
it's just going to be as it is and

2328
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,840
you know if the group is it does have

2329
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,600
consensus this is the best it can get

2330
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,679
then i'm happy to go with that but that

2331
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,199
was my my real concern there

2332
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:30,000
if that makes sense

2333
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:31,679
thanks uh

2334
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,480
if if if i may just quickly respond i i

2335
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,400
think that

2336
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,040
again a remedy and attribution are part

2337
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,119
of the human rights framework they find

2338
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:43,840
mentioned in the guiding principles for

2339
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,239
uh business and human rights as well so

2340
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,639
i think john kuran made like

2341
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,159
specifically pointed this out that's

2342
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:52,639
where the section also came from that

2343
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:54,239
may perhaps it's not the best decision

2344
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:56,639
to just shy away from it and to include

2345
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:59,360
it and discuss the trade-offs in this

2346
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,280
particular case like when it comes to

2347
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,600
designing protocols and

2348
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,960
i

2349
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,679
i also think uh

2350
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:10,480
i i would say like largely if i get the

2351
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,678
consensus right is that

2352
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,560
having an element in the protocol that

2353
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:19,040
provides attribution is overall against

2354
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,400
the other values we're discussing of

2355
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,000
privacy security

2356
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,360
and uh

2357
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,199
there's so much on on that side of

2358
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:27,600
privacy security anonymity so uh

2359
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,360
pseudonymity that

2360
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,440
attribute is and what we say here is

2361
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,440
that attribution is probably again like

2362
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,480
so you should

2363
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,400
it's not important to include this

2364
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,719
considering the other factors

2365
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:40,800
that's this consensus i sense on the

2366
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,679
group

2367
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:42,960
i think

2368
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:43,679
uh

2369
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,000
in favor of inclusion including this at

2370
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,159
all was the fact that it is in those

2371
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:49,840
documents and we shouldn't shy away from

2372
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,719
mentioning it but i think it accurately

2373
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,440
represents the consensus i

2374
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,000
i think that making any other changes

2375
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,119
would

2376
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:00,000
uh

2377
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,600
i mean we've discussed this like four or

2378
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,719
five times now i i i don't know

2379
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:06,960
yeah if any better solution is possible

2380
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,239
so i i

2381
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:09,920
but

2382
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:12,880
uh but yeah uh mallory if you think like

2383
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,880
i'm or also

2384
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,480
like you think i'm not capturing the

2385
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:20,080
consensus as well please let me know

2386
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,400
i mean my

2387
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:23,679
impression

2388
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:25,440
of obviously you know

2389
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:28,000
from from hillary and sophia to to judge

2390
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,080
the contestants but my impression is

2391
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:30,800
that

2392
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,840
you are judging the consensus correctly

2393
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,760
um

2394
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,320
my comment was much more of a

2395
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,639
i'm not sure i understand as a protocol

2396
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:43,040
designer what this section

2397
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:46,080
means to me

2398
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:49,280
um and i think it i think i

2399
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,199
it sort of ties a little bit into those

2400
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:55,199
broader comments uh i i had um about the

2401
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:59,280
interpretation of the rights and how

2402
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,360
you know i made a comment about how the

2403
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,119
rights interpreted differently in

2404
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:05,040
different parts of the world

2405
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,560
um and

2406
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,639
i i get the

2407
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:10,880
idea that the the authors have a

2408
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,639
particular view

2409
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:15,520
of how to interpret the various rights

2410
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,960
and have some understanding of what's

2411
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,280
what's meant by

2412
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,360
these various concerns

2413
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,040
but as someone who is coming to this who

2414
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,600
is is not a human rights expert

2415
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,840
and you know to the extent i see human

2416
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,760
rights discussed it's in the context of

2417
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,600
the national laws and

2418
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,679
you know the regulations i need to apply

2419
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,600
to it's hard for me to necessarily

2420
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,600
understand what what you're meaning by

2421
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,280
some of these rights

2422
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:45,280
uh and you know my comment about

2423
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,440
trying to give some examples was was not

2424
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:48,880
because i wanted an exhaustive

2425
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,400
discussion of how different countries do

2426
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,400
it it was just because

2427
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,239
i was finding it hard to relate the

2428
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:56,880
quite abstract discussion into concrete

2429
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,040
principles that i need to

2430
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,679
uh apply when i'm building uh a protocol

2431
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:04,320
or of designing a system

2432
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,320
and i i think this this section is one

2433
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,800
of those where that's especially uh an

2434
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,400
issue

2435
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,880
i understood so so to go in sequence i

2436
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,880
think the first part on

2437
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,119
attribution for in terms of practical

2438
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:19,280
guidance it means

2439
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:20,880
don't consider it like there's no need

2440
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:21,760
to

2441
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,080
that that's that's my reading of it like

2442
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,679
don't consider attribution while

2443
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,000
designing it because it goes against uh

2444
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,600
the other values discussed in the

2445
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,560
document on the second part i i fully

2446
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,280
understand what i mean i think perhaps

2447
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,000
slightly more basically um tell me what

2448
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,679
what you mean by attribution and what

2449
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:42,000
you mean by remedy before you then go

2450
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,440
into that discussion

2451
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,840
so i've pasted the text in the chat

2452
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,080
because i think sometimes it gets lost

2453
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:51,040
where this appears why in a human rights

2454
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,159
document will be talking about

2455
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:55,679
attribution it's because there is um a

2456
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:57,040
right to remedy

2457
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,040
so that means

2458
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,000
you

2459
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,600
you sort of give

2460
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,600
people the some recourse to harms

2461
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,679
and one way that you might do that is

2462
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:09,760
through attribution but

2463
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,760
you wouldn't necess so that's a balance

2464
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,159
so once you are faced with two rights

2465
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:16,400
that might come into conflict with one

2466
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,400
another there's got to be some kind of

2467
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,560
balance balancing act and so in the

2468
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,360
context of a protocol

2469
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,520
because of the greater disproportionate

2470
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,400
harm

2471
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,000
of attribution even though it might give

2472
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,480
an individual right to remedy it would

2473
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,040
potentially place

2474
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,600
like disproportionate harm on all users

2475
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,360
because of that additional identifier

2476
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,520
and that would violate both rights to

2477
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,080
privacy and security for for most people

2478
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:43,440
for the um

2479
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,360
remedy of one so that's what that's

2480
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,119
that's where it's situated in that

2481
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,520
section and i think otherwise it

2482
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,800
wouldn't come up because i don't think

2483
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,159
there's there's no like right to

2484
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:53,920
attribution that's a sort of that would

2485
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,199
be

2486
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:57,040
not included in here but it's related to

2487
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,560
the right to remedy so it's actually

2488
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:01,199
kind of minor in the grand scheme of

2489
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,800
things it's really not it doesn't

2490
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,239
feature that large and so um

2491
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:08,000
i wonder if

2492
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,360
there would be

2493
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,960
text that maybe better explains that i

2494
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,199
mean i think it's it the the amount of

2495
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:16,719
text that's there now seems to fit with

2496
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:18,639
you know the the sort of tone of the

2497
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:20,480
rest of the thing but if there's maybe a

2498
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,679
um

2499
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:24,159
because it it also it links i'm looking

2500
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:25,360
at the um

2501
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:28,239
the the references in that text they're

2502
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,960
a bit vague so it could be that that we

2503
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,880
could bring forward some text from the

2504
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,400
the david k

2505
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:37,360
um reference maybe one sentence or we

2506
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,000
could um just leave it as is because i

2507
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,320
think that reference would probably

2508
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,639
explain it better but anyway point taken

2509
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,080
i

2510
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,239
yeah it's just you know th this is this

2511
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:51,040
is written from the point of view of a

2512
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,800
set of authors who who have a clear

2513
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,199
understanding of what these rights mean

2514
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:57,360
um and how how they believe they're

2515
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,159
interpreted uh i i'm just not sure of

2516
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:02,400
the the protocol designers reading it

2517
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,960
have that context in that background uh

2518
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,040
and and that's where where i'm i'm

2519
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,119
struggling with it in places

2520
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:10,639
and there's a bunch of technical nuance

2521
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:12,480
which we can follow up on the list and i

2522
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,480
think that that's been you know

2523
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,239
greatly improved and

2524
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:18,560
you know i i yeah i apologize i haven't

2525
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,080
had time to go through all the details

2526
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,760
of that but i will follow up on the

2527
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,679
technical things but

2528
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:25,679
conceptually it's just just make sure

2529
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:27,840
the context and how the rights are

2530
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,480
interpreted what those rights are is a

2531
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,239
little clearer for people who don't have

2532
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:35,679
the background in human rights

2533
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:38,000
and so for next steps colin i think that

2534
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,400
it would be good to

2535
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:43,840
have your sort of re-review um and make

2536
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:44,960
sure that there aren't any other

2537
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,639
outstanding issues because as far as i

2538
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,480
understand as well from my perspective

2539
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,800
sort of the doc shepard chair and it

2540
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,719
seems to me that that is

2541
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:54,719
that that was the sort of last sticking

2542
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:56,320
point and then i think everyone

2543
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,560
everything else has been resolved but

2544
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:01,040
that um that depends on you and and

2545
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,280
whether or not this draft would uh

2546
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,320
progress

2547
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,560
quickly thereafter yeah

2548
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,199
yeah uh i i do have some technical

2549
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:10,639
comments i haven't had a chance to write

2550
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:13,040
them up properly but uh it is certainly

2551
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,199
going in the right direction and it's uh

2552
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:17,119
that the changes made a big improvement

2553
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:18,159
i think

2554
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:21,199
but yeah i i will try and

2555
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:22,639
review it carefully in the next few

2556
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:24,320
weeks

2557
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,000
thanks a lot great

2558
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,040
um

2559
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:31,119
any other comments anyone else oh sorry

2560
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:34,159
um i was going to say the same as the

2561
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:36,400
mallory and i was thinking maybe the

2562
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,400
same as making the reference clear or

2563
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,040
maybe moving it a little bit

2564
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:44,000
somewhere so it's more clear prior to

2565
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,119
just say using attribution in the text

2566
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:49,360
rather just maybe moving it a little bit

2567
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:50,560
further

2568
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:55,199
yeah so take a look at that

2569
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,719
yes perfect no note it so i'll uh

2570
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:00,560
we'll work on that and push an update to

2571
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,639
the remedy section and and

2572
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:04,080
call and look forward to your other

2573
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:07,519

niels i'm going to ask you to come in

2577
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:14,400
you're going to

2578
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,040
present on think on draft

2579
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,840
association

2580
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,440
here we go um

2581
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:34,080
uh talking about draft association

2582
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,199
uh

2583
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:36,719
me giles perez

2584
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:38,800
gizella president

2585
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,360
mallory we've all been working on this

2586
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,360
to expand and deepen the relationship

2587
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,280
between specific rights and protocols

2588
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,960
that's the second part of our charters

2589
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,199
are trying to implement that

2590
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:51,440
what we're not trying to do explicitly

2591
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,600
is analyze specific protocols for their

2592
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,679
human rights impact or produce new

2593
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:57,440
guidelines because new guidelines were

2594
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,679
in the document that we discussed before

2595
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:01,920
and analyzing specifical protocols is

2596
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,280
what we're doing in

2597
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,520
impact assessments

2598
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,960
so what we've been working on is that

2599
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,320
we've been working on this for five

2600
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,000
years now

2601
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,159
so we have a little birthday of this

2602
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:13,280
draft

2603
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,239
excellent

2604
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:16,639
so this has been an rg document for

2605
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:18,159
three and a half years

2606
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:20,880
with authors from academia civil society

2607
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,600
in different geographies and disciplines

2608
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,199
and uh

2609
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:28,159
now we've had a review and a new doc

2610
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:29,760
shepherd that we've been waiting for a

2611
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,400
while welcome nick thanks so much for

2612
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,480
agreeing to be the document shepard that

2613
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,000
is excellent

2614
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
so what happened since zero seven we've

2615
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,480
added definitions the abstract has been

2616
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:43,360
cleaned up uh and added conclusions as

2617
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,040
suggested by nick

2618
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,520
removed explanation methodology from rfc

2619
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,320
8280 to make things less messy

2620
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,560
many nits many language things where you

2621
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,760
can also see

2622
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,280
the different geographies and the

2623
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:56,719
different mother tongues that were not

2624
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:59,199
english shining through in the text

2625
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:00,560
sorry about

2626
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,800
all the dutchisms and all that and then

2627
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,719
spanglish and yeah it was beautiful

2628
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:05,920
thing

2629
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,080
but now more uh um

2630
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,880
a bit better grammar bit better language

2631
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,880
uh

2632
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,360
better language on accessibility

2633
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,560
uh

2634
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,560
added emphasis to the documents about

2635
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,880
human rights as per the hrpc charter and

2636
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,920
not implementation in national laws that

2637
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,760
could definitely be another document but

2638
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,119
we've talked about this before

2639
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:33,760
what could be done for

2640
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,360
10

2641
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,280
is work together with the shepherd of

2642
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,119
course because uh based on the shepard's

2643
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,920
review i post a new review so uh uh

2644
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,320
happy to discuss with the shepherd what

2645
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,480
could be done but what i think that

2646
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,400
could have more

2647
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:49,280
work

2648
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:53,600
is clearer connect the case studies

2649
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,560
uh

2650
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,480
no clearer connect the questions that

2651
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,600
arise from the literature review to the

2652
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,159
case studies because that is the

2653
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:04,159
the direction we went on and we try to

2654
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:05,760
fill in that is not necessarily as

2655
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,760
strong as it can so perhaps we should

2656
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,000
make that stronger but happy to work on

2657
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,159
that with the uh with the document

2658
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:13,920
shadow part and follow the document

2659
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,320
shippers and the chairs and the rg's

2660
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:21,199
opinion on that so that's where we are

2661
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:30,639
thanks a lot thanks a lot niels

2662
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:34,880
any comments on that um i mean i i

2663
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,440
i'm an author so i think with the author

2664
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,239
hat on i'm really grateful for the

2665
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:42,000
review from nick because i think it's

2666
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,679
making the smooth the document much

2667
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:46,400
stronger um

2668
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,360
and

2669
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:50,159
we've already been

2670
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:53,360
yeah okay nick go ahead

2671
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,719
i i don't want to interrupt you mallory

2672
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:03,760
my thought was not fully complete so i'm

2673
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:05,360
grateful for the interruption

2674
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:07,520
okay great um

2675
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,360
thanks niels for the very quick summary

2676
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,280
and i know we're short on time so i i

2677
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:15,520
won't i won't go into depth right now um

2678
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:18,400
uh thanks for doing those uh very

2679
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,320
quick responses and i'm certainly happy

2680
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,880
to help with those um

2681
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,040
steps i think that's a reasonable plan

2682
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:25,840
for

2683
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,840
what our next step should be i think

2684
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,000
there probably are still some more edits

2685
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,239
we can make and um

2686
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,719
and i do like uh yeah trying to make

2687
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:36,800
those clear connections between both the

2688
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,639
lit review which is you know something

2689
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:41,280
that's useful out of the document um and

2690
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,880
the direct cases

2691
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,360
uh and then i'm sort of curious for the

2692
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,719
for the

2693
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:49,040
chairs and for the research group as a

2694
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,800
whole it seems like we have been talking

2695
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,560
about this document for a long time once

2696
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,400
we've done those edits maybe we're ready

2697
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:57,760
for a last call and um and then as

2698
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,000
shepard i would just try to help us with

2699
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,920
any last comments we get from going

2700
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,880
through that process

2701
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,719
it seems to me as well that that

2702
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:11,119
would be the next step because i i feel

2703
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:13,679
that um

2704
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:15,679
sort of once we did the redesign and i

2705
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:17,280
can't remember if it was a year ago or

2706
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,800
two years ago i think it was two years

2707
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,880
ago um the sort of reworking of the

2708
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,480
whole thing it's really flowed quite

2709
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,560
smoothly from that point forward so i

2710
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:28,080
wouldn't think there would be

2711
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,239
a lot of hang up after

2712
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,000
we smooth that out

2713
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,560
but we'll see

2714
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,639
all right let's take it to the list um

2715
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,960
so yeah lenny i would love to invite you

2716
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:44,080
up um because we have 10 minutes left

2717
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,159
i'm sorry you didn't get your full 15.

2718
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:48,560
um but i'm just really glad to have you

2719
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,119
here to talk about a draft that i know

2720
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:54,080
you've presented elsewhere as well

2721
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,920
um so

2722
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,560
yeah welcome and um are you able to i

2723
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,960
don't know if you have slides or if

2724
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,239
you'd just like to

2725
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:03,280
i do

2726
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,159
uh

2727
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:05,760
sorry i didn't i didn't submit them to

2728
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,840
you did i that's okay you might be able

2729
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,760
to just screen share in the interest of

2730
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,199
time then

2731
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:12,159
yes

2732
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:13,760
uh

2733
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:16,080
which button is that

2734
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,239
it's the middle one

2735
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:20,560
okay that should work maybe

2736
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:21,920
no wrong

2737
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,040
wrong button uh

2738
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:28,440
there you are

2739
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,320
okay how about that

2740
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,800
yep we can see it thanks

2741
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,040
great

2742
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:45,760
so um

2743
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,960
gonna briefly go through uh a a recent

2744
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,240
draft on um considerations for

2745
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:52,639
[Music]

2746
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:54,320
regional internet blocking this was

2747
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,880
presented at ipeg and

2748
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,679
uh int area and given some of the

2749
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:02,239
overlapping themes thought it might be

2750
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:04,159
interesting to present here and get some

2751
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:06,159
of the feedback of the folks

2752
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:07,760
in this

2753
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,119
group

2754
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:11,760
to start with disclaimers this is

2755
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:14,960
the content is solely the views and

2756
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,280
ideas of the authors and doesn't reflect

2757
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:19,920
those of any of the uh organizations

2758
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,560
with which we are affiliated

2759
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,520
also to be very clear this was um

2760
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,360
it's kind of obvious for those familiar

2761
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:30,239
with ietf but um but it was requested

2762
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:32,320
that we mentioned this because there may

2763
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:33,520
be

2764
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:36,080
folks who are less familiar with ietf

2765
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:38,000
processes this is uh an individual

2766
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,400
contributing a contribution and does not

2767
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:43,119
reflect ietf consensus

2768
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:44,639
all right so moving along

2769
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:45,440
um

2770
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,639
let's start with the motivation of the

2771
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:49,599
draft um so you know in light of recent

2772
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:51,280
um

2773
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:54,560
events uh there have been um discussions

2774
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:55,599
of

2775
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:57,599
internet sanctioning or blocking

2776
01:52:57,599 --> 01:52:59,599
internet connectivity for

2777
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:03,119
a region or a nation

2778
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:05,199
and

2779
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:07,280
what we wanted to do is basically

2780
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,000
describe what that would look like

2781
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,920
describe some well-known approaches for

2782
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,599
blocking connectivity and what are the

2783
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:15,599
implications what would be the positive

2784
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:17,840
the negative uh the advantages the

2785
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,599
disadvantages some of the uh

2786
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:23,040
consequences intended and uh unintended

2787
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,080
um

2788
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,159
kind of our audience uh the intended

2789
01:53:26,159 --> 01:53:27,840
audience is policy makers and the

2790
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:31,119
general public at large um

2791
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:34,239
the idea is uh in order to have a good

2792
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:37,760
policy um depends upon good unbiased uh

2793
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:39,280
information so

2794
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,960
our goal is to describe um kind of try

2795
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,199
to stay in our swim lanes as as as

2796
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:46,960
engineers

2797
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,400
for for

2798
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,880
folks who may be considering uh this

2799
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,199
kind of policy

2800
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:54,800
explain what it would look like uh how

2801
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,280
it would work technically um

2802
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,760
would it and and addre and and talk

2803
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,119
about some of the

2804
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:03,520
intended and unintended consequences as

2805
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,760
well as you know efficacy

2806
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:09,119
um what this document is not

2807
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,679
is advocacy for against any particular

2808
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:15,119
policy um it is not political opinion uh

2809
01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:18,159
we don't go into the ethics of uh of of

2810
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:19,440
of blocking

2811
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:22,400
um also obviously there's

2812
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:26,960
you know an obvious um event uh episode

2813
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:28,880
uh geopolitical episode going on right

2814
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,880
now that kind of inspired this but our

2815
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,159
goal

2816
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:35,360
is to make it generic enough that uh it

2817
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,679
would be applicable to future events as

2818
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:38,960
well and not just

2819
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,880
one singular event

2820
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,480
um

2821
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,440
also

2822
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:45,199
this is not a about

2823
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:48,000
blocking against security threats

2824
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,560
coming out of a region but more like you

2825
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:51,440
know

2826
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,760
what would happen if one wanted to do

2827
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:54,560
the

2828
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,480
equivalent of you know economic

2829
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:57,840
sanctions for the internet kind of

2830
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,840
connectivity sanctions

2831
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:01,280
um

2832
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,639
it's also not a how-to guide on

2833
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:05,280
weaponizing the internet or

2834
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:07,440
exposing

2835
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,599
industry secrets

2836
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:12,560
or seeding uh

2837
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:17,199
the minds of folks with um

2838
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:19,440
i you know

2839
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,840
novel approaches to

2840
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,159
uh fragmenting the internet um we

2841
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:26,960
limited this to um just well-known

2842
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:29,040
approaches that operators

2843
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:31,920
uh use um for legitimate blocking

2844
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:35,360
purposes and what if they use use these

2845
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:38,159
well-known approaches uh to attempt to

2846
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:41,360
block an entire country or region

2847
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,880
we also didn't go into

2848
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:45,760
malicious attacks um it's a it's an

2849
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,239
interesting topic uh probably worth um

2850
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:51,199
you know its own document but uh

2851
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:53,199
it was just too broad of a of a topic

2852
01:55:53,199 --> 01:55:55,920
and something that was outside the um

2853
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,400
expertise of the author so we left that

2854
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:00,239
out of scope

2855
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:01,199
um

2856
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:02,960
so with that out of the way

2857
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:04,800
the meat of the document

2858
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,480
the blocking techniques we started kind

2859
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:07,840
of at the physical layer and worked our

2860
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:08,800
way

2861
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,159
up

2862
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:13,040
these are again nothing groundbreaking

2863
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,440
nothing secret um you know disk

2864
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:17,920
disconnecting cables um

2865
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,280
uh what that would do what that would

2866
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:21,520
look like um you know the advantages and

2867
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:24,000
disadvantages of that approach um moving

2868
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,520
on up to the the control plane the

2869
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:29,360
routing layer uh d-peering in bgp

2870
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,440
as well as bgp route filtering prefix

2871
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,520
based

2872
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:34,239
or

2873
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:36,000
asn based

2874
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,880
then moving along to a data plane

2875
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:41,199
packet layer filtering things like geoip

2876
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:43,520
access control lists what they do what

2877
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,080
they don't do some of the challenges

2878
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,679
and then dns

2879
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:48,800
review

2880
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:49,840
things like

2881
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,360
undelegating

2882
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,370
top level domains and other domains

2883
01:56:53,370 --> 01:56:55,040
[Music]

2884
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:57,840
could be one approach as well as um

2885
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,320
blocking resolution requests um from

2886
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,480
resolving name servers or

2887
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:06,239
um in-house within a region

2888
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:08,239
again um

2889
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:09,920
nothing really these are pretty

2890
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:12,239
pedestrian approaches that are pretty

2891
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:13,920
well understood by

2892
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,719
uh the types of people who attend ietf

2893
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:18,800
but the idea is about educating those

2894
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,400
who don't

2895
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,560
and who might want to know

2896
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,520
uh and might want to understand what are

2897
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,360
the challenge you know what are some of

2898
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,520
the options and you know

2899
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,280
what are the technical implications of

2900
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,119
each of these

2901
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:36,560
uh next we went to the gaps of efficacy

2902
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,800
so for example you know connectivity

2903
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,800
sanctioning um

2904
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,520
by a policy maker may actually be

2905
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:44,960
counterproductive to the aims of the

2906
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,920
county uh of the uh policymaker

2907
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:51,199
um for example the policymaker might

2908
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:53,760
want messages to get into and out of a

2909
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:54,719
region

2910
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:57,520
and blocking would would hinder that

2911
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,440
they may want certain parties say for

2912
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:01,360
example um

2913
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:03,520
opposition groups within

2914
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:06,800
uh the targeted region um they might

2915
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,880
want them to freely communicate and

2916
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,119
coordinate activities and hindering

2917
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:14,400
connectivity would obviously

2918
01:58:15,199 --> 01:58:17,679
hinder that

2919
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:20,000
also uh blocking connectivity may

2920
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,360
actually empower

2921
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,239
um a a a party that is targeted for

2922
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:26,159
sanction um you know could allow for

2923
01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:29,040
example a regime that is targeted to

2924
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,760
actually consolidate its power um

2925
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:35,520
and uh and and uh prevent

2926
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,040
um

2927
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,080
alternative messaging uh from uh being

2928
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,360
accessed

2929
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:42,800
um

2930
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,800
the network again doesn't uh

2931
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,560
discriminate between good and bad bits

2932
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:49,440
um it's just transmits bits whether they

2933
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,920
form good or bad

2934
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,520
messages

2935
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,520
other challenges to be aware are things

2936
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:56,800
to be aware of

2937
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,800
asns and prefixes are not allocated

2938
01:58:58,800 --> 01:58:59,920
based on

2939
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:02,320
geopolitical boundaries um they're

2940
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,880
roughly allocated based on region

2941
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:05,760
um

2942
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:09,280
but uh over time um

2943
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,280
you know for example an entity an

2944
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,520
organization uh within a country it's

2945
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:16,480
it's it's fairly easy to see all the

2946
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:19,840
assignments asn or route assignments

2947
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:22,000
to to entities within a region but

2948
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,880
those entities may be say acquired by

2949
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:27,920
larger multinational organizations and

2950
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,920
those announcements could

2951
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:32,159
could those bgp

2952
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:33,679
asn announcements or prefix

2953
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:35,280
announcements could could appear in

2954
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:36,639
different regions

2955
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:38,880
uh over time also registry information

2956
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:41,360
is notoriously inaccurate

2957
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:43,760
um finally the internet is you know

2958
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:45,040
decentralized

2959
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,199
by design uh making it pretty much

2960
01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:50,159
impossible to completely block a region

2961
01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:52,400
um that's a that's a feature not a bug

2962
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,920
um

2963
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,760
but uh

2964
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,440
it's it's it's worth noting that

2965
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,440
connectivity and throughput can be uh

2966
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:02,000
inhibited at certain choke points

2967
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,599
uh there is some relationship we have

2968
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:05,520
about one minute left so we want to make

2969
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,679
sure there are comments but go ahead and

2970
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:08,960
wrap up gotcha

2971
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,119
uh related work um

2972
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:13,280
they're they're they're you know rfc

2973
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:14,800
7754

2974
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,599
uh focuses more on um

2975
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:20,639
higher level issues um than than

2976
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:21,679
blocking

2977
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:23,679
uh routing infrastructure

2978
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:25,599
also its focus is a little bit different

2979
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:27,520
not so much sanction but there are

2980
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,440
overlapping themes

2981
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,040
and there's the censorship document

2982
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:33,199
which i'm sure folks in this group are

2983
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:35,360
more than aware of again it's a

2984
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,440
different focus but there are some

2985
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:39,440
there's some overlap

2986
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,599
in terms of next steps um

2987
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:43,440
you know we presented this at interior

2988
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,880
uh to

2989
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:48,560
and requested um adoption uh because it

2990
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:51,599
was determined that consensus was uh was

2991
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:54,239
there was not consensus uh to adopt it

2992
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:55,920
but the question we had was is this a

2993
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:58,000
useful document um

2994
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,719
uh is this worth pursuing

2995
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:06,280
um we'd love further comments and review

2996
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:10,480
lots more to say but i'll open it up for

2997
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:11,920
questions

2998
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,840
yes anyone needs to join the queue um

2999
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:19,440
get on mike that'd be preferable

3000
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:22,080
um i want to just point out nick's

3001
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:24,080
comment in the chat which i would agree

3002
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:26,560
with as author of or one of the

3003
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,880
co-authors late coming co-authors with

3004
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:31,280
the censorship draft in perigee

3005
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:32,239
on

3006
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:34,719
section 5.3.2 of that document feels

3007
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:36,480
like if there are improvements that

3008
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:38,159
could be made to that section based on

3009
02:01:38,159 --> 02:01:39,840
what you've documented in yours we'd

3010
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,199
really

3011
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:43,520
welcome that and niels

3012
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:45,199
go ahead and then followed by stefan in

3013
02:01:45,199 --> 02:01:48,400
the room go ahead niels

3014
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:50,719
thanks for the work and thanks for

3015
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:53,119
presenting it um i think that if you

3016
02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:55,599
want to reach a general audience rfcs

3017
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:59,040
might be the worst place

3018
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,960
from experience i try to get people to

3019
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:05,599
read them even students and they're just

3020
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:07,679
so it might not be the best place if you

3021
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:08,960
want to do that

3022
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:11,679
and the work on draft censorship

3023
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:14,239
um has been going on for such a long

3024
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:16,840
time and it would be really great to not

3025
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:19,679
start it there was a reason it took very

3026
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:21,520
long and that's why we get it there so

3027
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:22,960
it would be really great if we could

3028
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:24,560
make it part of that

3029
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,960
and not do another process of that i

3030
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:29,119
really hope you that you consider that

3031
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:32,080
and contributing to network

3032
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:34,480
sure thanks for the feedback um

3033
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:36,880
our goal was to make it a nice short

3034
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:38,320
document

3035
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:39,520
that

3036
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,119
might be consumable by the general

3037
02:02:41,119 --> 02:02:42,560
public

3038
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,320
but

3039
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:49,360
yeah thanks for uh the suggestion

3040
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:52,960
um go ahead

3041
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:56,080
i i think that the document is useful i

3042
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:59,599
agree with nils that it would be if in

3043
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:01,920
order to outwit the general public

3044
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,880
something from isaac for instance would

3045
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,560
be probably better but it's not a

3046
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,960
problem i mean it can be two different

3047
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:11,760
work one of the ietf focused on

3048
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:15,360
technical precision on one advisor

3049
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,520
focused on explaining good general

3050
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:20,239
public there is one thing missing maybe

3051
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:22,480
in the document is that

3052
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:24,960
disconnecting from the internet

3053
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:27,520
it depends on what you call the internet

3054
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:29,840
uh i mean it's not something you

3055
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:32,400
subscribe to when you're our country you

3056
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:35,280
have also a lot of internal connection

3057
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:37,040
service and so

3058
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:37,920
it

3059
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:40,880
it may be deserve some discussion about

3060
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:43,199
what does it mean exactly to be cut from

3061
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:44,800
the international cuts not from the

3062
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:47,360
internet are cut from other countries

3063
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:50,480
which may or may not be equivalent

3064
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:52,639
uh imagine uh sanctions against the

3065
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:54,639
united states and can we disconnect the

3066
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:57,280
united states from the internet

3067
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:59,119
that would be an interesting soft

3068
02:03:59,119 --> 02:04:01,759
experiment

3069
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:05,520
yeah so um

3070
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,880
it was brought up that isak does have a

3071
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,800
position on this and and and has

3072
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,199
articulated that pretty eloquently um

3073
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:15,280
and other organizations have as well i

3074
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:17,599
can i've seen um

3075
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:18,639
uh

3076
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:20,960
again we're we're trying to do something

3077
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:23,360
a little different which is not advocate

3078
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:25,840
one thing or another that's you know

3079
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,400
um what we're trying to do is describe

3080
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:30,800
uh what it would look like so that those

3081
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:32,800
who do advocate can

3082
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:35,119
do so with

3083
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:38,000
good sober technical information um we

3084
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,719
feel it's kind of you know

3085
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:42,400
uh the

3086
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:44,320
more appropriate for

3087
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:46,320
um

3088
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:49,360
uh you know engineers to say you know

3089
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:50,560
if you're thinking about doing this

3090
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,679
we're not gonna say if this is a good or

3091
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:54,480
a bad idea but uh if you are thinking

3092
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,400
about this um here's what you should

3093
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,280
know

3094
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,760
uh so that you can decide yourself is

3095
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,599
this a good or bad idea so that's kind

3096
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:04,239
of the goal um

3097
02:05:04,239 --> 02:05:05,599
and it's just a question of you know is

3098
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:06,639
is

3099
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:08,400
is there a consensus

3100
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:11,599
uh within ietf to actually do that

3101
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:14,320
um uh in terms of the mention about poor

3102
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,320
there is a section on porous borders

3103
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,159
that i think tries to capture what you

3104
02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:21,440
described the challenge is that you know

3105
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:23,360
it's really not easy to just disconnect

3106
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:26,639
the country um and what that means

3107
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:28,000
again these things are obvious to people

3108
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,760
who are familiar with the internet and

3109
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:32,239
and come to ietf but maybe you know to

3110
02:05:32,239 --> 02:05:34,560
the lay person not so much and hopefully

3111
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:35,920
that they can find that useful

3112
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:38,400
information

3113
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:42,480
uh so yeah i joined the queue um as um

3114
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:46,320
chair just in response to the chat um

3115
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:48,960
if there's interest here in this draft

3116
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,880
since it didn't seem that into area

3117
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,480
would progress with it and

3118
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:54,159
um i think both sofia and i are on the

3119
02:05:54,159 --> 02:05:56,000
same page that we're not in favor of

3120
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,159
adopting it here but it has been an

3121
02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:00,400
important discussion on the list and so

3122
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:03,040
we welcome that and um are glad that you

3123
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:05,280
came to present it here um because i do

3124
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,760
think it's been useful for folks to that

3125
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:09,599
have that have a history with working on

3126
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:12,239
draft censorship um which isn't even in

3127
02:06:12,239 --> 02:06:14,320
this working group so i think the or the

3128
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:16,239
research group i think the the action

3129
02:06:16,239 --> 02:06:18,079
would probably be to

3130
02:06:18,079 --> 02:06:19,920
follow up with

3131
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,760
a message to the

3132
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:24,159
privacy research group list

3133
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:25,520
about this draft to see if there's

3134
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:27,840
further discussion or interest from the

3135
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,320
research group in adopting some of the

3136
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:31,840
texts in the

3137
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:33,760
censorship draft although that draft is

3138
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:35,920
probably going to next call soon but

3139
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:37,840
that again you know happy to have had

3140
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,400
you um discuss here since it followed on

3141
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:42,159
from such a strong discussion on the

3142
02:06:42,159 --> 02:06:44,480
list but um yeah and and thanks again

3143
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,800
for that we have a few more folks in the

3144
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,960
queue and i'm i'm willing to keep going

3145
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,880
over time as long as you need echo i

3146
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,719
shut down my pc already so i could not

3147
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:54,719
join the queue

3148
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:56,960
to you stefan my name is eric wink i am

3149
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,119
also the internet arria director and

3150
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:01,040
just to mention again that andrew

3151
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:04,159
sullivan from ice up the society has

3152
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:07,199
published a nice paper two weeks ago

3153
02:07:07,199 --> 02:07:08,400
something

3154
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,000
which is more on the political aspect

3155
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,159
and it's really well written that's all

3156
02:07:12,159 --> 02:07:15,040
i need to say thank you

3157
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:18,280
i agree

3158
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:36,800
continue the queue

3159
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:38,560
yep okay

3160
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:41,840
go elite

3161
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,159
good afternoon good morning uh good

3162
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:46,320
evening to people uh this is an

3163
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:48,000
interesting draft

3164
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,360
um thanks to the authors uh for for

3165
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:53,360
writing things down

3166
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:55,360
um

3167
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:58,239
and uh what i was going to say lenny and

3168
02:07:58,239 --> 02:08:00,400
tony is

3169
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,480
i think it it's

3170
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:04,880
we should find a home for it

3171
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:07,679
but it seems to me like it's a good idea

3172
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:10,639
to expand uh some of i think these this

3173
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:12,400
is a good start

3174
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:15,040
right i i suspect that

3175
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,639
uh there's a fair amount more

3176
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:18,560
elaboration

3177
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:20,239
um

3178
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:21,119
and

3179
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:24,960
uh maybe a bit more discussion on

3180
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:27,360
uh goals

3181
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,199
not not to say

3182
02:08:29,199 --> 02:08:30,079
you know

3183
02:08:30,079 --> 02:08:32,880
not to wade into a you know what goal is

3184
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:35,520
good versus what goal is bad but

3185
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:38,079
what goals can be achieved just to be a

3186
02:08:38,079 --> 02:08:40,000
little crisper

3187
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,840
in the draft around that

3188
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:44,639
and then to examine each of the

3189
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:46,800
mechanisms that you talk about just a

3190
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:50,079
little bit more crisply in that regard

3191
02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:52,480
um and i think you would find i i think

3192
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,000
actually what what

3193
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,480
that will lead people to i think

3194
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:58,800
likely very good conclusions

3195
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,480
from my own political

3196
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:03,599
perspective um because this is a uh

3197
02:09:03,599 --> 02:09:06,079
obviously a field uh fraught with

3198
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:07,040
um

3199
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:08,320
landmines if you will in the

3200
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,159
intellectual sense

3201
02:09:10,159 --> 02:09:13,679
um and uh so i do appreciate the work

3202
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:15,679
and i look forward to seeing it continue

3203
02:09:15,679 --> 02:09:17,920
somewhere um i just hope that it you

3204
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:21,119
know it can find a right home

3205
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:23,760
thank you um and yeah you know like i

3206
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,119
said we're

3207
02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:27,280
we tried to balance it with keeping

3208
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:30,560
things at a high level um again we

3209
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,079
didn't want to plant seeds and give

3210
02:09:32,079 --> 02:09:34,960
people ideas uh and also we want to make

3211
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,400
it readable to

3212
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:39,280
you know a 50-page document is um

3213
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:40,719
probably not going to be you know

3214
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:42,159
readable to the audience that we were

3215
02:09:42,159 --> 02:09:44,000
hoping for and we didn't want to just

3216
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:44,960
kind of

3217
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,960
live in an echo chamber with an ietf of

3218
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:49,199
people who already know this stuff

3219
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:51,360
but more as a work that

3220
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,280
uh the people who do know this stuff

3221
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:54,960
want the people who don't know this kind

3222
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:58,159
of stuff to to to know and understand

3223
02:09:58,159 --> 02:10:00,320
so that they can come to better informed

3224
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:03,199
decisions um

3225
02:10:03,199 --> 02:10:04,800
yeah just briefly bringing forward some

3226
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:06,960
discussion from into area

3227
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:09,520
yesterday just felt that it wasn't a

3228
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:10,719
great

3229
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:12,960
representation of ietf's mandate to keep

3230
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,280
everything connected so it would

3231
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:16,960
obviously be useful for folks who missed

3232
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:19,040
that you can watch it on youtube as well

3233
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:21,599
um anyway ben you're the last one on the

3234
02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:23,360
queue go right ahead

3235
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:26,079
thanks ben schwartz so

3236
02:10:26,079 --> 02:10:27,599
having had some more time to think about

3237
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:30,480
this draft i think that

3238
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:32,639
the the best way to make it more useful

3239
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:35,520
would be to change the intended audience

3240
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:38,639
i don't think that ietf documents are an

3241
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:41,360
effective way to speak to

3242
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:42,960
effectively governments and policy

3243
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:45,440
makers which in my view is the

3244
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:47,679
is the implicit audience here

3245
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:50,480
because uh this is about it's phrased in

3246
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:52,639
terms of countries and and so we're

3247
02:10:52,639 --> 02:10:54,880
talking about actions that countries

3248
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:55,679
take

3249
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:57,760
relative to each other i think that's

3250
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:59,840
not an audience that the ietf can reach

3251
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:02,079
very effectively and i think that we we

3252
02:11:02,079 --> 02:11:04,000
have a real risk of miscommunication if

3253
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,639
we try to reach for that audience

3254
02:11:06,639 --> 02:11:08,639
i think that what might be more

3255
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:10,400
productive here would be to focus on the

3256
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,719
audience we can reach which is

3257
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:15,119
technical service operators

3258
02:11:15,119 --> 02:11:16,639
and i think there's a really interesting

3259
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:20,000
question in there that that you

3260
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,199
are close to addressing which is as a as

3261
02:11:23,199 --> 02:11:25,520
an individual service operator maybe an

3262
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:28,000
authoritative dns service operator may

3263
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,400
be uh a peering provider

3264
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:31,199
um

3265
02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:32,960
under what circumstance is it you know

3266
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,719
what what should my considerations be

3267
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:36,639
when i'm thinking about ceasing to do

3268
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:39,280
business with somebody

3269
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:42,239
you know what are some what are some

3270
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:43,119
uh

3271
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:45,040
reasons why

3272
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:46,400
you know what are some goals that i

3273
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:48,639
might be able to achieve by deciding

3274
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:50,400
that i'm no longer willing to for

3275
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,800
example peer with another as and what

3276
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:55,040
are some goals that i'm not going to be

3277
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:58,000
able to achieve that way

3278
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:01,599
um

3279
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:03,440
yeah that's that's interesting feedback

3280
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:04,880
you know

3281
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:07,040
tony and melchior and i are

3282
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,639
you know trying to reassess what would

3283
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:12,000
be the you know best next steps

3284
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,520
you know i'm i'm personally of the

3285
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:14,800
belief that

3286
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:16,960
it would be good if the ietf produced

3287
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:19,440
documents that aren't just

3288
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:21,280
to be consumed by those

3289
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:24,239
you know preaching to the choir um who

3290
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:27,440
uh are only in an itf and i think you

3291
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,920
know the organization would be more

3292
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:31,760
effective and maybe the world would be a

3293
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:33,280
better place if

3294
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:35,280
if um

3295
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,920
our documents were were more consumable

3296
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:38,880
uh

3297
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:41,920
by the general public um

3298
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:43,760
who are interested in learning and

3299
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:45,360
understanding um

3300
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:47,199
about the you know such a vital

3301
02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:49,920
technology um so

3302
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,920
but i mean that's that's

3303
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:52,800
uh

3304
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:55,440
a fair point that it is challenging um

3305
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:56,880
and uh

3306
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,239
you know the idea

3307
02:12:58,239 --> 02:13:01,119
of writing something for

3308
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:03,599
operators um

3309
02:13:03,599 --> 02:13:05,199
that's you know an interesting an

3310
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:07,199
interesting idea that um

3311
02:13:07,199 --> 02:13:09,280
uh i know that the other

3312
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:11,920
tony mel and i will definitely consider

3313
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:15,400
so thank you

3314
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:19,840
