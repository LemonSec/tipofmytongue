27
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:30,980
agenda bash would do quick update on our

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,629
drafts as you may have noticed we've

29
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,000
actually got a very short amount of

30
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:38,480
scheduled sorry of schedule actual talks

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,819
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda we originally requested a</font>

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,459
90-minute session we've got two and a

33
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,958
half hour session the Suffolk actually

34
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,840
on the agenda when he isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even second</font>

35
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,209
hour and a half<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even lat but well</font>

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,739
touch on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a moment so we've got</font>

37
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:55,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">we should go out and do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

38
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:58,130
about the Babel profile and Ted and

39
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,000
Daniel me go have<font color="#E5E5E5"> produced a simpler</font>

40
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,459
version of home that name in

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,620
architecture for our consideration which

42
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:06,349
I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be intended to replace</font>

43
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,760
the most more complicated version but

44
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:13,429
well that's a TED talk to that when he

45
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,530
comes up so new drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the working</font>

46
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,829
group so Ted's aforementioned simple

47
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,540
home that naming the home let dog three

48
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:22,910
and home letra back go three I've got me

49
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,679
an ad evaluation but Terry will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

50
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:29,590
coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit about</font>

51
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:32,120
those after the other two presentations

52
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">but just point out now he will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,709
Korra find questions only I'm sure Terry

54
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,209
will we emphasize that when it comes up

55
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,669
in light of the newer home that name in

56
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,549
architecture document heads previous

57
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:48,769
version has expired<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

58
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,359
number of documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are other</font>

59
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,989
waiting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> working other working groups</font>

60
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:55,700
or essentially have gone by the wayside

61
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,180
as things develop on the name in

62
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,179
architecture

63
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:06,530
so without further ado Judas come please

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,530
come up for his presentation please

65
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">stand in the pink box and the fray dark</font>

66
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:16,370
liquor isn't working so I only try to

67
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:20,900
slice from him I could have done

68
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:24,950
discreetly perhaps I could have them on

69
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:26,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">this screen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the convenient for me I'm</font>

70
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:39,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">afraid this is just make the motor</font>

71
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:45,680
history<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so uh hello is that better</font>

72
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:48,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I accepted to be editor of the</font>

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,780
Babel profile for home that draft which

74
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:55,490
was meant to be a technical but rather

75
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,900
consensual draft so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has two parts so</font>

76
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,760
i will wondering whether make it to

77
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,039
draft or one mark and then we can do

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">just one draft there is a first part</font>

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,540
which tells you how you parameterize

80
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">Babel if you want to use it in home that</font>

81
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,010
so it says things like if you have a

82
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,650
gigabit ethernet link give it a metric

83
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:15,530
of 96 then say exactly that but that's

84
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:18,859
the rough idea or it tells you that you

85
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:21,710
must implement ipv6 and you should

86
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,050
implement ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay things that are</font>

87
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,789
needed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get reasonable</font>

88
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,410
interoperability between different

89
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,480
helmet implementations and there are

90
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,510
just parameters that you plug into that

91
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,210
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not no problem at all and the</font>

92
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:38,659
second part gives the interactions

93
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,340
between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HNC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> p protocol and the Babel</font>

94
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,990
protocol so there's our things that

95
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't happen on the wire there are</font>

96
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,610
purely local interaction between the two

97
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,780
demons and they tell you things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

98
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:55,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">example if you are announcing an</font>

99
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:58,940
external prefix with ipv6 then you

100
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,100
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> ensure that Babel is announcing</font>

101
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,780
its or specific default route and gives

102
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,430
the details hey those are things that

103
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,530
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty obvious that we understand</font>

104
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,729
how the pieces fit but they need to be

105
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:13,758
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> down somewhere and so we have</font>

106
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:17,628
two implementations of<font color="#CCCCCC"> agency d agent H</font>

107
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,400
net<font color="#E5E5E5"> D and SH</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NCPD and that was pretty</font>

108
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:22,009
convenient because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could know when</font>

109
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,688
when I was being too strict if I was

110
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,069
forbidding the behavior of one of the

111
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:31,129
two implementations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't behave</font>

112
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:33,740
exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> next please so the</font>

113
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">planner was you know to have one of</font>

114
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:41,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">those clean draft that become RFC after</font>

115
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:44,388
just two iterations dash 0 0 was a first

116
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:46,849
document that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had written on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my own I</font>

117
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:49,339
presented it in Berlin said I have

118
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:51,919
doubts about this about that the working

119
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:54,409
group was extremely helpful there was

120
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,930
consensus there was almost unanimity on

121
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:59,419
all the points already raised except one

122
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,639
on which the minority opinion didn't

123
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,818
feel really strongly about it and so

124
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,969
dash 0 1 was a complete document

125
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:11,210
absolutely perfect in all ways just send

126
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:13,939
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the iesg and be done with it there</font>

127
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:19,508
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Polish proverb that says that man</font>

128
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:19,509
makes plans and God laughs next<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

129
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:29,080
requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 in the draft I didn't</font>

130
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:34,969
write<font color="#E5E5E5"> it entirely that says roughly that</font>

131
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:37,279
that a home net implementation of Babel

132
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:39,050
must implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> H Mac based</font>

133
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,370
authentication with reference to the

134
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:49,759
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> RSC and must enable it if signal</font>

135
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:51,680
to do so by H NCP next and I have no

136
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,080
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote it but they have absolutely</font>

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what that means so basically</font>

138
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,930
this is not precise enough to ensure

139
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:07,448
interoperability and as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I know</font>

140
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:10,849
nobody has any plans<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement it so</font>

141
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:13,129
I first raised the issue in private with

142
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:16,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">mark than in private with both chairs</font>

143
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:18,769
and Marcus<font color="#CCCCCC"> stenberg then i sent a</font>

144
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:21,859
detailed mailing to the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font>

145
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:24,200
which will find in the archives on far

146
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,020
so january this year

147
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,789
and I did not receive and the helpful

148
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,789
advice on the mailing list next please

149
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,540
so in order to implement requirement

150
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,080
five you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a consensus</font>

151
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:42,370
mechanism that allows hnc denotes to

152
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,110
decide that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to enable</font>

153
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,260
authentication on a given link the

154
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">consensus mechelen can be as simple as</font>

155
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">we always enable authentication that is</font>

156
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,240
a consensus mechanism but the consensus

157
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:58,460
mekin it needs to be defined second you

158
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to become figuring all of</font>

159
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:05,390
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> net returns with a</font>

160
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:07,699
authentication key so what you need here

161
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,449
is a second consensus mechanism which

162
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,670
allows the HNC p note to agree on an

163
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:17,780
authentication key that they asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

164
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:20,810
battle so we need to define the

165
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,839
algorithms we need to define the packet

166
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:28,839
format and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide a</font>

167
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:32,930
reference implementation neck please<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

168
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,820
really proud<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have been working with</font>

169
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,280
helmet on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last over the last two</font>

170
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,640
years I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we are very serious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

171
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,810
home that about having work in code

172
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,090
everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

173
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,270
working group as either has been

174
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:52,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented either once or twice or I</font>

175
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:54,920
love this word price and I would not

176
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,900
like to be to innovate by being the

177
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:02,750
editor the first document that nobody

178
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:06,020
has any plans<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leas so</font>

179
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm stuck here i have a few suggestions</font>

180
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:13,850
so the simplest but perhaps problematic

181
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:18,640
and the 1 i'm in favor of would be let's

182
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:20,630
drop requirement five and say well

183
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:26,960
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the problem at the</font>

184
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:29,330
lower layers use wpa use wpa to put a

185
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:34,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">guy with a Kalashnikov in front of every</font>

186
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:37,730
ethernet plug the second suggestion i

187
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,769
have is would be to find someone who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

188
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,290
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the work that is who is</font>

189
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:44,540
willing to describe the needed

190
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,339
algorithms who is willing to define the

191
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,709
packet format and who is willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

192
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:51,079
on the reference implementation I'm not

193
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:53,599
volunteering to do that because I'm not

194
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:57,349
competent to work on security stuff of

195
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,510
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quite willing to help the</font>

196
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,940
second the third suggestion i have i'm

197
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:06,199
trying to be exhaustive here is fire me

198
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:09,740
the canoe editor and well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open to</font>

199
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:19,250
other ideas please thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

200
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay my views so I'm slightest</font>

201
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,550
pointed that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a cure people</font>

202
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,470
volunteering to help or a deal they

203
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:29,959
prefer other suggestions sorry there's a

204
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:33,110
very sensitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> mic or rather very narrow</font>

205
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:35,750
Mike<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so slightly spongy we don't</font>

206
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,250
have a cure people preferring helpful

207
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:41,870
suggestions of how we get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

208
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:43,459
impasse from the chairs perspective my

209
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:48,079
concern when asked about this

210
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:49,430
requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> five is simply that I was</font>

211
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,410
not convinced that we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get</font>

212
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,819
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iesg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without a suitable</font>

213
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,819
mechanism in place in the document

214
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:03,440
sectarian speculation on that

215
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:04,579
potentially yep is there any feeling for

216
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,050
whether we should simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take this</font>

217
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:12,529
out for the document I'm time yes there

218
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:16,279
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna see Apple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regarding for your</font>

219
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:19,970
point about the Hegira viewing for that

220
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:22,160
matter the broader ITF we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't every</font>

221
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,199
protocol doesn't necessarily need an

222
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,899
authentication mechanism it's that every

223
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:28,849
document needs a security considerations

224
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:31,399
security discussion so there's a lot of

225
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:35,029
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that went through this on the</font>

226
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:37,430
security requirements and what we could

227
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,069
do to solve them that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful</font>

228
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,019
and documented in the document but it

229
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:44,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't need to be a hard requirement on</font>

230
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:48,380
the protocol yet if so my personal

231
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,869
recommendation would be to option one to

232
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,260
remove requirement five

233
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:56,630
because one of the main goals in my

234
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,950
opinion of home net is that i can buy a

235
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:01,790
bunch of routers from different vendors

236
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:03,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">i plug them in and I'm done uh if that</font>

237
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,660
involves<font color="#CCCCCC"> i plug them in I go into the</font>

238
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,310
one from this it has this web UI to copy

239
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,140
this key and I go to the other one to

240
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,029
type it in that oh crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in the</font>

241
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,350
wrong language it's never<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work</font>

242
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:17,120
so until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we figure out a whole story for</font>

243
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,950
this we shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements on</font>

244
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,950
ourselves this can always be added later

245
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:32,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pizza and so there is a threesome</font>

246
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:35,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">security in the HNC p already so in the</font>

247
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:38,860
RFC there is the use of TLS supposedly

248
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:41,180
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the links that are unsecured so</font>

249
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">agents be supposed to have some way to</font>

250
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:48,170
decide whether a link is secure than or

251
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:50,690
not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on I think it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">part of hgf statements that we should</font>

253
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,580
design protocols that are secured so

254
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,890
just leaving it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropping the this</font>

255
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:02,270
requirement would make whole Nets

256
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:05,360
vulnerable to routing protocols attacks

257
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:08,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be annoying i think that's it</font>

258
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,839
defining something in the text that

259

decides how to pick a key for<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

260
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,930
shouldn't be that complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> i feel a</font>

261
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,839
little bit like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like to help</font>

262
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:26,120
but I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not competent to</font>

263
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:27,920
touch security stuff but I'm sure it's a

264
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,680
matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a few lines of code it's not</font>

265
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,920
so complicated please we need Marcus

266
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,959
Marcus can you hear us Marcus responded

267
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll i'm watching in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the java room he</font>

268
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:43,189
says running manually keyed ipsec as a

269
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:53,239
would be obvious choice all rfcs are out

270
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:56,089
there already smirk Ted lemon so a i

271
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,480
think that uh you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS seems like</font>

272
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:01,130
it would solve this problem once again

273
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,760
excuse you TLS seems like we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve</font>

274
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,850
this problem

275
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:09,000
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a threat model or security</font>

276
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,790
model that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a really big</font>

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,910
gaping hole in what we're doing and

278
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,500
that's why you aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting any</font>

279
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,699
enthusiasm<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this because what's the</font>

280
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:23,390
point of implementing this if you don't

281
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,390
know how you're going to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it uh sorry</font>

282
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,860
what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> over there maybe I'll</font>

283
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,780
just maybe I'll just be Elvis right so

284
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:35,910
um things kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of heavy um so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh yeah so</font>

285
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,370
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a security model we</font>

286
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have a threat model um we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

287
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,110
know what we could reasonably accomplish

288
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,730
and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can't reasonably</font>

289
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,470
accomplish and so it's no surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

290
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,880
nobody's enthusiastic about implementing

291
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,220
something that we don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to</font>

292
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,770
deploy and I think that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

293
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,540
problem so debating about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

294
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:57,420
basically the way the hand wave that I

295
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,339
would do here is is you know use<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls</font>

296
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:10,400
but we also actually need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop waving</font>

297
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:13,950
her hands and solve this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey so</font>

298
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:17,100
you would advocate<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us at least Julia</font>

299
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,860
Julius has in his slides an assumption

300
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,830
that we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue with the</font>

301
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,350
predation of having a reference

302
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:27,780
implementation for everything that we

303
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:31,850
put into our<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet drafts and our</font>

304
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:34,620
RFC's I think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just heard okay well</font>

305
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:37,160
maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could relax at this time it's</font>

306
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,010
better to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at least have</font>

307
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">some text I mean that would that would</font>

308
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,610
there's a proud tradition in the IETF of

309
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,800
the security considerations<font color="#E5E5E5"> section</font>

310
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,170
sprinkling ipsec or whatever the you

311
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,880
know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite security mechanism</font>

312
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:54,089
of the day is and saying yep I've got a

313
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,040
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know maybe that's what</font>

314
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,350
we need to do because that's all we know

315
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,680
how to do is that what you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

316
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,120
uh sorry I actually when I got up to the

317
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">mic intended to say something a little</font>

318
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,619
more detailed than what I actually said

319
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,270
if we don't have a mechanism that we can

320
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,379
actually implement that will it will

321
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,790
work to authenticate that table

322
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,620
implementations to each other then we

323
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,089
can never<font color="#E5E5E5"> have interoperability because</font>

324
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,530
a million gable implementations out

325
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:21,300
there some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of which implements security</font>

326
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:25,040
and some of which don't which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

327
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:31,740
actually exactly the scenario that that

328
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:33,510
I'm sorry he was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so uh so</font>

329
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,130
we act what the right thing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

330
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,930
actually put some security mechanism

331
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,120
that we think will work if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can figure</font>

332
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,160
out how to key it and then solve the

333
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,330
keying problem later because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

334
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,470
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know how to solve the keying</font>

335
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,669
problem right now does that make sense

336
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,440
in other in other words assume that you

337
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:52,800
have keys do you have keys that you

338
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,679
shared in some secure way and having

339
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,950
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can now sign your</font>

340
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,620
communications<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

341
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,080
mechanism the authentication mechanism

342
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,969
is what the issue is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that the</font>

343
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,449
main problem is the interaction between

344
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">H NCP and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> devil right so as data pointed</font>

345
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:15,150
out you really do want the keys you

346
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,820
really don't want to be configuring

347
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Babel you want H NCP to take care of the</font>

348
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,290
configuration and everything to happen

349
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,750
in hnc p and you have a chance ed to

350
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,480
decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> on everything including the keys</font>

351
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,540
that Babel is using and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

352
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,820
defining the HNC p mechanism and do that

353
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,220
and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bed that worries me so</font>

354
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Julius left terrified somewhere to</font>

355
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,090
understand that Babel already has a

356
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,040
specified H night based authentication

357
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,379
mechanism because what you're saying is

358
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the problem is scope to simply how</font>

359
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,300
do we securely distribute the keys

360
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,760
within the network so is to configure

361
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,230
Babel itself so we're not asking how how

362
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure Babel but just how to</font>

363
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,760
distribute these yes and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

364
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,910
paraphrase paraphrase for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a BF find</font>

365
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,340
workarounds so Pierce point if i

366
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:06,179
understand it right is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all</font>

367
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:09,840
doable we sort of know how to do it but

368
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody needs to step up to do it it</font>

369
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,500
just kept estas speaking just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

370
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,169
contradict<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very</font>

371
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,780
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> with agency p to get to get a</font>

372
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:22,170
pre-shared key that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give out</font>

373
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,389
to Babel assuming agency is running in a

374
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,480
secure mode or using DTS on links that

375
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,580
are unsecured it's just a theory and a

376
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,419
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus among the writers we do</font>

377
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,850
that all the time

378
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:37,309
just the tlv containing some some key

379
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,309
and we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto generate a key for babel</font>

380
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:47,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">david's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ganassi well if we assume that</font>

381
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have keys then what kind of like that</font>

382
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">was easy and I not sure that's the right</font>

383
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,488
assumption to make because if we design

384
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,989
all these protocols with an assumption

385
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:56,970
and then there's no running code

386
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:58,919
whatsoever and then we realize oh that

387
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,690
never managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that assumption to</font>

388
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,590
work then we just have all these

389
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:07,889
paragraphs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't help as people point</font>

390
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,199
out there are many mechanisms<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls ipsec</font>

391
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:12,629
pick your choice that all need to be

392
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,700
bootstrapped and rushing into saying oh

393
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:17,129
let's use<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> h mac for babel</font>

394
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">versus that's run all this over ipsec is</font>

395
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:25,709
a premature decision until we figure

396
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:29,249
that out so just to throw additional

397
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:32,820
gasoline on the fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I this is Ted</font>

398
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:34,289
lemon again I think that actually what

399
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pierre just described is not the right</font>

400
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:39,720
way to solve the problem because what

401
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,759
you really if you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre-shared</font>

402
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:47,609
keys that are that are a symmetric than

403
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,080
what you want is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a key pair that</font>

404
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:50,879
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a key that's shared</font>

405
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,210
between each pair of communicating

406
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:55,350
devices not not a key that everybody

407
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,609
agrees on if you have a key that

408
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:00,629
everybody agrees on you have no security

409
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:04,619
at all because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't tell you're</font>

410
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:08,279
talking to I think agency p works like

411
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:11,158
works this way so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> hnc p it's it's</font>

412
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,869
based on you know trust I mean it's a

413
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,869
bit more advanced security model in

414
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:18,299
agency p the idea being that every time

415
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:21,209
you would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to modify that key that</font>

416
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,249
Babel uses you just updates the key so

417
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,710
if you need to revoke someone you know

418
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:27,720
reebok some router it's a chance if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

419
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,619
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just change is the key</font>

420
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,619
that is used by babel

421
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,100
the key that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used by babel is</font>

422
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,290
generated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> agency and can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mowed can</font>

423
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:44,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">be modified at any time agency p as a</font>

424
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:46,490
strong stronger yeah the specific point

425
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,800
that I'm making is that a key used by

426
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,260
babel is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right solution there</font>

427
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,980
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a key shared between each pair</font>

428
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:57,800
of devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are communicating so</font>

429
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,680
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question for Judas then does</font>

430
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:05,230
the Babel security profile allow

431
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:10,070
pairwise p sharing or is it network<font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>

432
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:12,080
allows multiple t-shirt key that it

433
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,470
doesn't have multiple keys so I don't

434
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:19,040
know certainly there are deployments

435
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:21,950
where their group keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus pairwise</font>

436
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,409
for everyone I mean it's this gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

437
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:28,430
the whole debate of you ease up<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

438
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:30,590
ease of key distribution versus your you

439
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:34,400
know your threat model and and the

440
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:36,860
security right so I mean I know the

441
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,630
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of solutions that have have some</font>

442
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,139
sort of group keying involved like I

443
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you did this arguments between Ted</font>

444
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,490
and Pierre is degenerating and I am

445
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:51,680
paralyzed on an actual authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

446
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:53,990
routing protocols is ran Atkinson<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

447
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,330
I'm actually the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original author of the</font>

448
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,950
ospf authentication and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rip</font>

449
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:03,980
authentication both of which are

450
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:06,050
deployed and with ospf all of the

451
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,600
routers on a given link have to use the

452
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:11,330
same key there is no distinguishing the

453
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,000
router a originated the message as

454
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,149
opposed to router see if router is a B

455
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,650
and C share the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> length so there</font>

456
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:24,140
there is ospf is in existence example

457
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:31,010
that you don't necessarily need unique

458
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:35,690
keying for rib<font color="#E5E5E5"> a common key is used for</font>

459
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:38,900
all routers in both ospf and rip there

460
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:43,040
is no automated key management that's

461
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:46,269
built into either rip or ospf the ITF

462
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,719
had a carp kar p working group

463
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:53,139
some years ago which basically went

464
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:57,820
nowhere to try to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> automatic keying</font>

465
00:23:53,139 --> 00:24:00,549
for routing protocols what people really

466
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:06,820
do in practice is they use provisioning

467
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:10,299
systems and a specific example is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

468
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,609
an ISP that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> running something like</font>

469
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:15,519
netcom might or might not actually be

470
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:21,279
netcom and they probably are not using

471
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:24,369
yang today but they have ssh or TLS as a

472
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,919
way to protect the provisioning session

473
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:28,988
between a centralized database<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

474
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,359
knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the configuration of all the</font>

475
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:33,820
devices and the key is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one element</font>

476
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,070
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and they send that over a secure</font>

477
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,320
authenticated channel that may or may

478
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:41,708
<font color="#E5E5E5">not be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it but that is</font>

479
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,208
a common way but it is done I don't know

480
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:45,759
of anybody doing automated key

481
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:47,649
management for rip<font color="#E5E5E5"> because people who</font>

482
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,269
are using rip have small networks and

483
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:51,518
it's practical to just run around and

484
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:55,329
type in the keys oh we have a protocol

485
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:57,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">fill up but but at least 40 SPF people</font>

486
00:24:55,329 --> 00:25:01,299
can and do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know large ISPs can and</font>

487
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:03,789
do provision the keys using their the

488
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:06,549
same mechanism they use to configure the

489
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:09,009
routers remotely yeah so the questions

490
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:12,158
the group plan is do we have people here

491
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:15,129
in the room or on the list or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java who</font>

492
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,570
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> help with number two it sounds</font>

493
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:18,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've certainly got some expertise</font>

494
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,379
in the Robin as far as our routing

495
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:22,029
protocol securities concern below it as

496
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:23,320
per previous discussion it's really

497
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:25,419
actually the institution<font color="#CCCCCC"> keys is the</font>

498
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:30,609
problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HNC p rather than a</font>

499
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:31,629
ranking protocol per se if it ever got

500
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:40,269
people here can stand up and be counted

501
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:42,519
I object to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that proposal this</font>

502
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:45,700
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same situation as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

503
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:47,259
that's operated by like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I mean</font>

504
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">we used to use rip back at deck when I</font>

505
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:50,440
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> first started doing networking</font>

506
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,178
stuff right was actually Rick v1 I think

507
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,019
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of explosive but let's not</font>

508
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:57,489
get into that and you know we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

509
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,229
operated a network where we had to go

510
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,039
type the keys in or where we shared the

511
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:01,600
keys with<font color="#CCCCCC"> HNC</font>

512
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:03,460
he but this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same situation</font>

513
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,459
anything that connects to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network in</font>

514
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,710
principle can join the HNC peak

515
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,389
conversation and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

516
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,830
want debug ability you have to know who

517
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:14,019
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to you have to know who</font>

518
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,279
sent the message and to know who sent

519
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:17,399
the message it has to be signed with a

520
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:21,429
key that<font color="#CCCCCC"> belong to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular</font>

521
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:23,248
entity not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key that is shared amongst</font>

522
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:26,919
all entities that are communicated

523
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:28,720
that's the issue and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so now my point</font>

524
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,399
here is not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should accept that</font>

525
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,369
what I just said is true I may be

526
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:35,289
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> full of here but we need</font>

527
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:37,059
to actually do the threat analysis and

528
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:41,349
figure out if what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said is true rather</font>

529
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:42,999
than um jumping to a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

530
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,590
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

531
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,899
can legitimately go forward without

532
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:49,238
doing that work and that's work that

533
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:51,518
we've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of been punting on for lo</font>

534
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:53,169
these many years I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

535
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,210
interested doing that work I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

536
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:56,590
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do it by myself because then</font>

537
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,859
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get Ted's opinion which is</font>

538
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,809
probably wrong but but we need to do

539
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:03,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that work and and if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do that</font>

540
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:05,229
work before we publish this then we're

541
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:07,960
going to wind up with no secure

542
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:10,749
interoperability so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make a</font>

543
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,820
proposal we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> um the wonderful</font>

544
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:15,580
opportunity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is 9 a.m. on</font>

545
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,649
monday we have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that seemed</font>

546
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:21,340
at least you know have expertise and

547
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:23,228
maybe even motivation if by the end of

548
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:27,340
the week you guys get together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

549
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:29,820
yes we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can i can ask</font>

550
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,529
for call hands right now you know for

551
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,928
volunteers to raise hands if you guys

552
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:36,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">get together with a you know coherent</font>

553
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:39,549
way forward by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the week this</font>

554
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">week that's the that's the design team</font>

555
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:42,940
and well of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> whomever else would</font>

556
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,729
want to join<font color="#E5E5E5"> in on list if you can get</font>

557
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,059
Marcus here<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be great</font>

558
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:50,379
is that a little unconventional but i'm

559
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:52,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">just using the fact that it's nine a.m.</font>

560
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:54,039
on monday and we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 43 if we also</font>

561
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,149
have a fair amount of time probably at

562
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,549
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the session if we don't keep</font>

563
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:58,959
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this ok can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a raise</font>

564
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:02,049
of hands of people that would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

565
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,849
join in on the security discussion with

566
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:09,179
Ted with the ultimate goal of people

567
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:12,070
fulfilling number two here with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Julius</font>

568
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:13,359
awesome you see those names you see

569
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">those people look around there's at</font>

570
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:19,309
least five

571
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:20,929
people in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um you guys get</font>

572
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:23,480
together with Ted and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Julius afterwards</font>

573
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:29,690
and try to solve this by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the</font>

574
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:31,190
week make sense well league jump in I'm

575
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,840
late at the mic but I was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> line is</font>

576
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:34,429
Jabbar scribe yeah sorry Lee Howard

577
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,129
relaying from Marcus Steinberg he wanted

can support<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go technically we can</font>

support multiple keys but not for N

582
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:49,580
squared keys for end devices so there's

583
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,080
the potential scalability but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:57,019
he's also going to be paying attention

up

587
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:10,669
oh goody we don't have the monitor

588
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:13,620

00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:16,710
Danny me go above me a little while ago

590
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,939
to get to work on this simple net naming

591
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,230
and service discovery architecture

592
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,540
because the working group didn't seem

593
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,830
all that excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous</font>

594
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,149
complicated home net naming and service

595
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:28,530
discovery architecture maybe I should

596
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:31,920
chose in a better title so next slide so

597
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:36,000
we got together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Daniel produced a</font>

598
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:39,600
kind of a you know intention document

599
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,180
and I took what he did and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of at</font>

600
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">the very last minute before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I TF took</font>

601
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,240
the old document sucked the bits out of

602
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,970
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think are relevant to what we</font>

603
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:52,350
actually possibly might have consensus

604
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:55,080
to do and produced a new draft that is

605
00:29:52,350 --> 00:30:02,100
it was published<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the deadline has</font>

606
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:06,600
anybody seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> document oh boy all</font>

607
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:08,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">right all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right well so so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just</font>

608
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,649
tell you about it so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a first</font>

609
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,360
draft as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I suck the bits out of</font>

610
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,160
the old on that naming architecture

611
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,530
document so there are still a few little

612
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,720
crumbs left over from that document that

613
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:20,670
need to be cleaned up but it's pretty

614
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">solid in terms of the general structure</font>

615
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:26,790
I think all the stateful stuff and all

616
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the security is gone there's no external</font>

617
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:34,379
visibility of name so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't publish</font>

618
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:36,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">on that zone anymore at all um the hope</font>

619
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,130
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> intention in the way that the</font>

620
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,810
document is written is that you could

621
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,000
pile a second document on top of that

622
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,679
that adds that functionality back and I

623
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,700
certainly intend to write that document

624
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:49,350
whether it will get working group

625
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:52,890
consensus or not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know um let's</font>

626
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:56,070
see and you know unsurprisingly it

627
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:58,560
relies on DNS SD discovery proxy which

628
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:04,470
is the new name for the DNS SD hybrid

629
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:06,629
proxy next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so uh there there are a</font>

630
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:10,230
few differences what happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us oh I</font>

631
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:12,030
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah the that was a late night slide</font>

632
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:15,390
issue so there's a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

633
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:17,789
differences from what's specified in the

634
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:22,529
simple architecture versus what's in the

635
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:24,690
uh the discovery proxy document uh the

636
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:26,489
discovery proxy presents the discovery

637
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:32,789
proxy is a single functional block<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

638
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:33,929
split into two functional blocks the so

639
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:37,619
the two functional blocks of the Korean

640
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:39,239
proxy in the relaying proxy and the

641
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:42,899
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the discovery proxy</font>

642
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:44,669
relies on the manager of the network

643
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:46,258
providing meaningful names for the links

644
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,629
and obviously that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to happen</font>

645
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:50,159
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a home net so we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to come up</font>

646

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> names and they don't mean anything</font>

647
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:57,659
and there are some issues with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:59,340

from hosts whenever it gets a request it

651
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,879
generates proxies which it sends to all

combines the responses it does the name

658
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:28,139
uh let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see uh it only does DNS</font>

it just realized them back to the

00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:30,450
probably although there there could be

00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:31,679
some debate about that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:40,920
might actually already do some caching

so uh let's see it doesn't do any name

687
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,380
rewriting it assumes essentially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

multiple responses since we're talking

697
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,530
actually then specify the relaying proxy

704
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:27,870
have to support really<font color="#E5E5E5"> proxy next slide</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">uh name conflicts this is not really</font>

706
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:32,870
different than what's in the hybrid

707
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:38,970
sorry the discovery proxy document um

708
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:40,400
mdns does name defense on the link so we

709
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:43,139
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about names being</font>

710
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,900
named conflicts on the link that's taken

00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,520
care of by mdns conflicts across the

713
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:57,410
they're dealt with in the discovery

716
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:07,890
look weird to users so if there are

717
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,839
conflicts then a one way to deal with

<font color="#E5E5E5">that is that we can in the case of</font>

00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,850
option another option is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

722
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,260
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> always present the link sub domain</font>

723
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:24,589
so the user just<font color="#E5E5E5"> always sees that little</font>

724
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:28,980
ugly number I don't love<font color="#E5E5E5"> that solution</font>

725
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:30,840
and then you know there's an unanswered

726
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,150
question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's unanswered probably</font>

727
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,460
because I'm just ignorant as to how big

728
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:41,610
of a problem this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um let's go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

729
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:43,620
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide uh so these are the these are</font>

730
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,580
the sets of cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think can cause</font>

731
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,940
naming conflicts

732
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:52,150
I had a naming conflict on my laptop

733
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:54,130
it's called macbook pro and as soon as I

734
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,780
connected the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF network for some</font>

735
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,280
reason there was another device on the

736
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,110
network called macbook pro I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

737
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,460
why so this can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just happen by accident</font>

738
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,870
it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen because somebody's trying</font>

739
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack a device like if you got a</font>

740
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,509
printer somebody might try to pose as

741
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,910
the printer and capture all of your

742
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:13,360
documents and then kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of man in the</font>

743
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:15,490
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> you uh so that's a possible</font>

744
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,890
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why there could be named conflict</font>

745
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,649
I've never actually seen that happen but

746
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:22,270
obviously it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a bad idea to defend</font>

747
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,900
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> it although we don't actually</font>

748
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:28,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a defense against it another thing</font>

749
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:32,110
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen in networks that dude</font>

750
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,819
the discovery proxy wrong is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

751
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:35,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device that's prison on one link</font>

752
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,820
and then it appears on another link the

753
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,710
discovery proxy may defend the name on

754
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the second link causing the device to</font>

755
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,510
renumber its name they<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually just</font>

756
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">increment a number and then that kind of</font>

757
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,350
produces ugly result another thing that

758
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,509
can happen is you've got a device's got

759
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,580
to network interfaces and if they

760
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:56,770
present the same name on different links

761
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:58,180
then you have a conflict so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

762
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,100
problems the reason why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

763
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,620
actually solve this is that mdns doesn't

764
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:06,759
have a unique identifier per device as

765
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,960
far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know so uh so we can't just</font>

766
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,310
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the identifier and say oh these</font>

767
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,980
are the same device we don't need to do

768
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:14,799
this ambigua<font color="#E5E5E5"> shin which would be awfully</font>

769
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,510
nice um we can't use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link local</font>

770
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,220
address because it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be different</font>

771
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,930
you know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if its serial you might</font>

772
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,279
connect with the Wi-Fi at one point and

773
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,660
then with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet at another point</font>

774
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,470
that a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac address doesn't</font>

775
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:29,140
work um I don't love the solutions that

776
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:31,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have I'd like to come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

777
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,720
better solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there is no solution</font>

778
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:37,630
that's perfect either we either we have

779
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,870
to add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new protocol which is somewhat</font>

780
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,550
impractical or we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do some kind</font>

781
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:45,220
of heuristic to deal with the name

782
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:48,460
conflict issue and whatever that

783
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,720
heuristic is I have a feeling is going

784
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,230
to have some edge cases that are going

785
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:55,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be difficult so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

786
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:59,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should decide on I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

787
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,460
to you know I could go either way I mean

788
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,440
I'm a geek so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about the</font>

789
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">little weird numbers that much but I</font>

790
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,960
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feeling that that it may cause a</font>

791
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:13,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of pain for end users uh but</font>

792
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:17,250
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so uh that's we need just</font>

793
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:20,170
we need to figure that out next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

794
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:21,730
yeah so so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some regrets about</font>

795
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,610
about going to the simple architecture

796
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:28,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm i I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not entirely happy with it</font>

797
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:30,880
although i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's probably you</font>

798
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:32,830
know a good choice from from a from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

799
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,620
standpoint of being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support less</font>

800
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:38,440
capable routers we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a security</font>

801
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,940
model the old the old architecture was

802
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,170
heading in the direction of a security

803
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">model didn't really have a security</font>

804
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,910
model either but it was getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there um</font>

805
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,620
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> registration protocol</font>

806
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:50,440
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're just using mdns</font>

807
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,670
and mdns has issues there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

808
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,230
about emptiness that don't work it would

809
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">be awfully nice to have a registration</font>

810
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:58,150
protocol um and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do the</font>

811
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,009
registration protocol in this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

812
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,850
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we realistically are</font>

813
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:06,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have a registration protocol so</font>

814
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:08,200
that's a regret um there is no clean way

815
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,560
to enumerate all services that's just

816
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,240
not how MBS works if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font>

817
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,830
clever you can sit and sniff on the wire

818
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,750
and watch services services announced

819
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:19,390
when they come on the wire<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that</font>

820
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,730
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> depends on all the all of the</font>

821
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,870
stars being right and we know what

822
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,550
happens when all the stars of rights

823
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:27,700
it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a good idea anyway um</font>

824
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:29,020
and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> states</font>

825
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:33,700
so there's no place to<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect that list</font>

826
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:35,259
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had one and you know we're</font>

827
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,700
not fixing mdns<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess that really goes</font>

828
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,690
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the registration protocol thing</font>

829
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:43,359
so next slide so basically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

830
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:47,080
this is the last slide breathe a sigh of

831
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,030
relief uh so we need to decide whether

832
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to do this or what I was</font>

833
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposing before if you're not familiar</font>

834
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:56,530
with this or what I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing before</font>

835
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:05,050
you probably have a strong opinion about

836
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:06,370
this um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to we</font>

837
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,900
need to figure out whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we care about</font>

838
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,420
the registration protocol issue it's not

839
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">really our problem so arguably even if</font>

840
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,760
even if we did care about it we couldn't

841
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,220
solve the problem

842
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,470
here anyway I actually have a document

843
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,080
that I that I did in DNS SD the talks

844
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:22,720
about the registration protocol issue

845
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,490
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the order that we could put in</font>

846
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,990
the water is whether we specify it in

847
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:28,000
our architecture we specified our

848
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:30,129
architecture than we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to probably</font>

849
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,410
get dns SD to actually solve the problem

850
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:36,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm sure they'd love that and you know</font>

851
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,890
there's a disambiguation problem you

852
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,570
need to figure that out and we need to

853
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:44,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how important ugly versus</font>

854
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:46,450
clean presentation is to us so those are

855
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:49,000
those are the decisions before the

856
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:51,939
working group if nobody here except

857
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,140
three have read the draft I don't know

858
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can make those decisions in the</font>

859
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,319
room today but these are things that we

860
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:59,470
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking about the draft by</font>

861
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:03,540
the way is only eight pages so it

862
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:03,540
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that painful to read it soon</font>

863
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:14,230
hi Ted item for the note takers my name

864
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,270
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stuart cheshire I think the</font>

865
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:20,550
suggestion that the DM SSD working group

866
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:23,470
take some of this on is not a bad one I

867
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:25,450
have recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> been getting more involved</font>

868
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,790
as an industry organization called the

869
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:31,299
thread group which I think was

870
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:35,080
originally spearheaded by nest but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

871
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:37,990
as many companies in it and they're

872
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:41,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing good work using mesh networks</font>

873
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:44,859
using 6lowpan and that's a mesh network

874
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:46,299
so classic multicast is is painful on

875
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:50,350
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and they need a surf</font>

876
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovery solution so I think there's</font>

877
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:54,839
definitely an industry need for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

878
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:03,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm still learning about threat I but</font>

879
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:06,399
but I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a consumer of this one</font>

880
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,109
other little point which I almost

881
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,780
hesitate to mention because it may be

882
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:14,080
abused but you said there's no way to

883
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:16,570
enumerate services there is a

884
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:20,410
little-known feature and if you look in

885
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:24,010
RFC 67-63 search for underscore services

886
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:26,649
and an serve a query for underscore

887
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:29,350
services on other school DNS SD

888
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:31,900
enumerates all the service types now

889
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:34,060
there may be devices that don't support

890
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,740
that correctly and that's an issue in

891
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,330
all protocols if it's not implemented

892
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,819
correctly it's not there to work but<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

893
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:42,700
least in principle there is a way to do

894
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,500
this exhaustive bootstrap where you get

895
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,970
the list of services and then fit your

896
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,120
service type you get the list of

897
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:51,009
instances and and this can produce a ton

898
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,830
of traffic on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network but that you</font>

899
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:58,900
can pull that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thread and in principle</font>

900
00:42:53,830 --> 00:43:02,049
find everything cool thanks I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ted hi</font>

901
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,970
Carolyn verizon just as you rightly

902
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,760
pointed out in the previous session that

903
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:08,709
one should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not go off and design</font>

904
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,430
security solutions without a threat

905
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:15,000
model I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it would be useful to</font>

906
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:17,500
have some sort of a user model

907
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,540
articulated you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> before we you know</font>

908
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,480
really hone in on specific solutions for

909
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:23,980
this work so for example it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

910
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,370
that you're pointing at a residential

911
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,990
user on what sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> could we</font>

912
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:30,790
assume about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that user does the user</font>

913
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:35,169
know a priority what service they are

914
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:37,509
searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> for on what you know what's</font>

915
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:40,920
the what's the maximum length of a flat

916
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:43,990
list of instances for that service that

917
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,610
we might know one I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present</font>

918
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,620
before the whole you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the</font>

919
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:49,150
whole thing kind of breaks down so you

920
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably have such a model in your head</font>

921
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:54,730
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they could be very useful if</font>

922
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:58,270
you prefaced the technical part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

923
00:43:54,730 --> 00:44:02,710
with you know some mmm yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of yeah</font>

924
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:05,290
that's a great suggestion thank you hi

925
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:06,940
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is andrew sullivan ah and i think i</font>

926
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,230
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand on that a little bit so I</font>

927
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,610
have to apologize because I was

928
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,350
following the other architecture

929
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,850
document which didn't seem to be getting

930
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:15,310
updated I wondered why and now I know

931
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:17,259
sorry I so I read this very quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

932
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:21,490
now I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably missing something</font>

933
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:23,770
uh but I have to I have to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

934
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:25,720
think what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kerry just said is is right</font>

935
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:28,270
that it's I'm starting to feel like the

936
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,359
target is not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear here and we</font>

937
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a whole bunch of stuff including a</font>

938
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:37,480
long and boring discussion that we've

939
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,460
had about names um that um that all

940
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,539
happened because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted you know the</font>

941
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,829
big set of

942
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:43,929
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was in the other</font>

943
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:45,939
architecture document that made for

944
00:44:43,929 --> 00:44:48,339
things to be complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now we've</font>

945
00:44:45,939 --> 00:44:50,109
whittled that down in this document it

946
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:51,699
looks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me so that most of those</font>

947
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:54,369
controversial decisions that we were

948
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:55,989
making didn't need to happen anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

949
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:59,979
we could we could just get around all of

950
00:44:55,989 --> 00:45:02,380
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so I I now feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

951
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to step up one level and sort of make a</font>

952
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,609
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearer exactly which target</font>

953
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,979
were trying to hit right we had some we

954
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:11,348
had some use cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> early on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it feels to</font>

955
00:45:08,979 --> 00:45:12,609
me just looking at it and again i did

956
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:13,929
this very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly like while you were</font>

957
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:16,150
talking so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm missing</font>

958
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:17,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it feels to me like what</font>

959
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,539
we're actually doing is throwing away

960
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:21,219
some of use cases that we had before in

961
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:22,390
order to make this simpler that's okay

962
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:24,249
that's that's a perfectly reasonable

963
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:26,169
thing to do but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

964
00:45:24,249 --> 00:45:27,640
consciously rather than yeah but rather

965
00:45:26,169 --> 00:45:30,759
than to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to simplify yeah that's</font>

966
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:33,368
exactly right um that you know I feel

967
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:35,349
the same frustration like like you know

968
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:37,059
whether whether the the kitchen sink

969
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:39,339
approach that I chose last time was the

970
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:40,719
right approach or not this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font>

971
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:42,819
the most pared down approach that I'm

972
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,400
even willing to contemplate and it's

973
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:47,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty pared down and I'm not in love</font>

974
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it does have the virtue of</font>

975
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:53,169
being pretty easy to come to consensus

976
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:56,739
on and we already basically know how to

977
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:58,058
do it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh I'd rather do something more</font>

978
00:45:56,739 --> 00:45:59,769
ambitious but the fact of the matter is

979
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:01,089
here we are how many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> since the</font>

980
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:03,038
working group was chartered and we don't

981
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:05,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an architecture for naming yet so</font>

982
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:08,609
maybe that's an indication that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

983
00:46:05,259 --> 00:46:12,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">to set our sights a little lower elf</font>

984
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:14,919
roth drums in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest of giving you</font>

985
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:19,869
something to do that's more ambitious<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

986
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:21,879
wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are other local naming</font>

987
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:24,400
mechanisms local name and protocols that

988
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,659
you might want to at least leave hooks

989
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:32,529
for or consider for future inclusion of

990
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:34,989
trying to to about the design principle

991
00:46:32,529 --> 00:46:36,519
don't cut yourself off from other things

992
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:38,559
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might want to include venture</font>

993
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:42,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit have you already considered that and</font>

994
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:44,979
and honestly no I haven't so if you if

995
00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:48,130
you have some suggestions<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in that</font>

996
00:46:44,979 --> 00:46:51,098
direction I Beverly service hmm nice

997
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:53,979
return of service oh yeah I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been here</font>

998
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:54,490
a while so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a great</font>

999
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:56,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggestion</font>

1000
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:59,229
and and I I don't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say and</font>

1001
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:00,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore you go you go deal with it</font>

1002
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:03,730
also look at it but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you may know</font>

1003
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:11,440
more than I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> so oh no no no I make no</font>

1004
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:13,480
such claims okay so since I'm getting is

1005
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird too early to be looking</font>

1006
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:19,900
adopting this and as yet we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

1007
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,470
adopted the earlier advanced home

1008
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:26,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">nickname</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in architecture document either</font>

1009
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:27,609
but unfortunately means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font>

1010
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> position to do anything until I</font>

1011
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:30,460
think we see at least one more Rev of

1012
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:34,570
this stop it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a look at the</font>

1013
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:36,550
feedback they getting today so I'm

1014
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:40,540
guessing there's Patek to push something

1015
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:42,610
out fairly soon and please if you have

1016
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:45,220
to be back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ted again it's nine</font>

1017
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:47,650
o'clock Monday yeah we have a week to

1018
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,970
get further feedback into its this at

1019
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:53,080
some discussion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list as well</font>

1020
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:56,080
please and if I didn't forget something

1021
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,340
out way before Prague so that by private

1022
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:02,830
we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense it's cool to</font>

1023
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:04,960
actually adopt<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Joe any other</font>

1024
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:07,569
questions thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you okay ash on a</font>

1025
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">related note i see Daniel over there in</font>

1026
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:13,420
the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we do have too much older</font>

1027
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:16,830
documents relating to naming that Daniel

1028
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:20,140
is also co-author<font color="#CCCCCC"> all so there's the</font>

1029
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:27,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">front-end name delegation and the HC</font>

1030
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:29,859
options related to that those to my mind

1031
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,020
now look like they're pretty dead you

1032
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:33,850
concur with that Daniel or do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1033
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:36,670
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> still scope for those to be</font>

1034
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:40,779
brought into a more advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> naming</font>

1035
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">scheme further on it's unclear where</font>

1036
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:47,290
those sit now will what do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

1037
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:50,290
address something different than the one

1038
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:53,230
we addressed oh yeah so I don't think

1039
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:55,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a sense that which is waiting</font>

1040
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:59,770
for there were more looking at how you

1041
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:02,080
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> outsource your name is your</font>

1042
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:06,100
alternative name is server from your CPU

1043
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:08,170
to an outsourcing architecture so I

1044
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,960
don't think their dad

1045
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:12,579
okay we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just waiting for the naming</font>

1046
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,190
out for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> restaurant at John Adams</font>

1047
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be okay we'll let them sit where</font>

1048
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:19,510
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are then for now might be done but</font>

1049
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:21,669
we might have to change them once we

1050
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:34,119
ended up your tickers okay thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1051
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:39,730
okay sorry hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks responsible ad hat</font>

1052
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:43,390
on so when the home net dot document

1053
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:46,960
came across my desk for a eval<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sent a</font>

1054
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:50,670
request off to DNS old for them to

1055
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:55,420
evaluate this in two aspects one is the

1056
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:59,890
6761 constructs<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other is to consider</font>

1057
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:02,020
the secure delegation<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of DNS</font>

1058
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,990
SEC or so the insecure delegation in

1059
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:06,849
terms of DNS SEC the request is fair and

1060
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:09,520
appropriate and it's what we do in the

1061
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:11,470
IETF because we like cross area<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross</font>

1062
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:15,299
working group review especially given

1063
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:19,000
that the place where I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at here</font>

1064
00:50:15,299 --> 00:50:20,799
so what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe at this</font>

1065
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">point in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and i'm only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font>

1066
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:25,390
this going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask the clarifying</font>

1067
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:27,839
questions is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is my current</font>

1068
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:29,828
assessment of where we sit at the moment

1069
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,630
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people who are engaged</font>

1070
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">in discussions in fact we've had a</font>

1071
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:35,799
number of discussions with a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1072
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,869
people to try and work out what the

1073
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:41,650
situation is and where we might go<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1074
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:48,460
here so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my summary situation at</font>

1075
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:50,230
the moment dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> homenet could could be</font>

1076
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:55,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">added to the special use domain registry</font>

1077
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:57,750
based on 6761 second one the expected

1078
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:01,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">future operation of home that resolution</font>

1079
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:04,359
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns validating stub resolvers</font>

1080
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,640
requires a break in the DNS SEC chain of

1081
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:09,790
trust I mean so this you you already

1082
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,848
know you've heard it before so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1083
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:16,359
achieve that second one the document

1084
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:19,450
being that the draft additionally asks

1085
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:21,819
Dianna to insert an unsecure delegation

1086
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:25,359
into the root zone

1087
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:30,069
the ask for that is not covered in IETF

1088
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:32,078
policy terms and it actually tries to

1089
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:37,209
put an entry into someone else's

1090
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:39,789
registry now doing that will probably

1091
00:51:37,209 --> 00:51:43,078
require a set of very collaborative

1092
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:45,219
discussions with the i kin community a

1093
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:48,839
new process would probably have to be

1094
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:51,910
constructed and I that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be</font>

1095
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:55,390
and there are no expectations that that

1096
00:51:51,910 --> 00:52:01,479
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> will happen in any reasonable</font>

1097
00:51:55,390 --> 00:52:03,038
time frame so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some options and</font>

1098
00:52:01,479 --> 00:52:04,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not the options that I see</font>

1099
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:07,869
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of where</font>

1100
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:11,769
some people surrounding this are are

1101
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:14,769
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about obviously there's the</font>

1102
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:17,019
status quo which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ck dot home that</font>

1103
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:18,729
special use domain with the request for

1104
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:20,618
an insecure delegation to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route and</font>

1105
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:23,948
so that's your status quo as it stands

1106
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:26,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now second option would be to seek</font>

1107
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:31,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">a dominant special use domain without</font>

1108
00:52:26,499 --> 00:52:33,609
the delegation<font color="#E5E5E5"> request and ask the IETF</font>

1109
00:52:31,029 --> 00:52:36,219
iesg IAB to convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion with</font>

1110
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:39,400
the i kin community to achieve an

1111
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:43,779
insecure delegation there's another one

1112
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:52,089
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to seek a home</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DARPA insecure</font>

1113
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:55,660
delegation as per RFC 3172 or the last

1114
00:52:52,089 --> 00:53:03,880
one go<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a dot home that special used</font>

1115
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:05,440
to main with asking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg IAB arm IETF</font>

1116
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,199
to go off and talk to the i kin

1117
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:12,279
community but if that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't work full</font>

1118
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:13,869
back to doing something in upper so

1119
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:15,069
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas that we're</font>

1120
00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:18,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about and i thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

1121
00:53:15,069 --> 00:53:20,920
work it's worthwhile to highlight that

1122
00:53:18,009 --> 00:53:24,249
to the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group to say this is not</font>

1123
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:27,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">an easy conversation to have there are</font>

1124
00:53:24,249 --> 00:53:31,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of aspects to this with that i'm</font>

1125
00:53:27,819 --> 00:53:31,349
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clarifying questions</font>

1126
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">West heart occur and EOC eyesight what</font>

1127
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,600
would the insecure delegation delegation

1128
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:45,270
excuse me for not being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak</font>

1129
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,770
look like so you know I mean part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1130
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:49,530
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that before making that</font>

1131
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:51,120
decision is I'd wanna<font color="#CCCCCC"> know would would</font>

1132
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:53,190
there be a nameserver record and what

1133
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,900
would it point to there would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a name</font>

1134
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">civil record it would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an unsigned</font>

1135
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:01,590
nameserver record and would be pointing

1136
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:03,390
to the is 112 I think it was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1137
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:05,010
there was some debate about exactly what

1138
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:06,420
to do yeah yeah that would be if that

1139
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:08,100
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be 10 shape you would point to</font>

1140
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,310
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would return uh I don't</font>

1141
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:15,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what you're talking about answer</font>

1142
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:17,130
hey um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so uh I guess you know from</font>

1143
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">my perspective you know ray and I were</font>

1144
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:24,960
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this earlier and I'm</font>

1145
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:28,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering like does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it does it seem like</font>

1146
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,480
a bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea to you guys just to because</font>

1147
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:33,000
we have a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other related</font>

1148
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,380
problems like this I mean dot onion

1149
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,420
doesn't need a delegation we actually

1150
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:38,880
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure denial of existence for</font>

1151
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">not onion but for example localhost</font>

1152
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,320
currently has a secure denial of

1153
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,799
existence which is bad so there are

1154
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,700
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are other cases where we have</font>

1155
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:51,540
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really ought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in the</font>

1156
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:53,100
root zone 'isn't and what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1157
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,410
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean should should we just should</font>

1158
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,839
we just have a document<font color="#E5E5E5"> in DNS off that</font>

1159
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:59,879
solves all of these at once I think the

1160
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:03,450
clarifying question you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask</font>

1161
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:05,970
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is there something else we can</font>

1162
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:08,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">do given that there are other use cases</font>

1163
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:10,290
well it's what I just described sounds

1164
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,730
an awful lot like out your option<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and</font>

1165
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:14,759
and and that sounds like a reasonable

1166
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:18,090
option to me I mean is it sound as you

1167
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:20,700
know I it's a fluid state right now so I

1168
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:26,430
really have no strong answer for you

1169
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:28,560
sorry no worries just do if I understand

1170
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,330
Ted are you trying to raise the point

1171
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,759
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're trying to do something</font>

1172
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:35,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">but there's other general stuff so it's</font>

1173
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,410
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just us there's other well no I mean</font>

1174
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:39,240
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that rat</font>

1175
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:42,270
hole basically what I'm just what I'm

1176
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:45,839
what I'm asking is like is the right

1177
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:46,560
process to just do what we are talking

1178
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,480
about doing

1179
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,790
special use domain names registry and

1180
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,560
then separate have a separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> process in</font>

1181
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS off that just deals with all of the</font>

1182
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,650
cleanup<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the cases where we really</font>

1183
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,510
need a delegation in the root zone and

1184
00:55:55,650 --> 00:56:00,360
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one one of which would be</font>

1185
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:06,180
home that so the clarifying point is is

1186
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:07,980
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you asking the group to be you know</font>

1187
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,960
one work item amongst a general thing

1188
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:12,510
that's going on Indiana dns off anyway

1189
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,480
or remove ourselves from that general

1190
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:18,210
thing and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the important</font>

1191
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:23,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> higher level question in a</font>

1192
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:25,890
administrative sense to Terry is that am

1193
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,360
I making sense I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Terry just said</font>

1194
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:29,190
that he that he doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the answer</font>

1195
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for us so okay so I'm</font>

1196
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:35,490
okay with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if this is a hard</font>

1197
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:37,649
problem Paul Hoffman so a couple of

1198
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:40,140
things please don't do the status quo

1199
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:42,390
because I'm sorry please<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you the</font>

1200
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:45,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">status quo going into IETF last call</font>

1201
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:47,339
because the discussion and i HAF last

1202
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:50,280
call will be useless it'll be useless to

1203
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:52,410
you it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useless to the iesg it will</font>

1204
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,010
be on many topics that turn out not to

1205
00:56:52,410 --> 00:57:00,210
be important so please don't do that I

1206
00:56:55,010 --> 00:57:03,270
you know pick another one um if you feel

1207
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:06,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">like doing status quo please rewrite the</font>

1208
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:09,120
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a consideration section that is I</font>

1209
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:11,490
pointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out some issues after working</font>

1210
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:15,060
group last call here the authors worked

1211
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:16,919
on them and that scares me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font>

1212
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,360
didn't come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the working group it</font>

1213
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,640
just was like the others oh yeah you're

1214
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:23,910
right and just did that that to me seems

1215
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">like not a good way to have this working</font>

1216
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:29,160
group understand what is being asked of

1217
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:32,490
the IHF and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hf last call we've seen</font>

1218
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:35,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">some ITF last calls recently that are</font>

1219
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:37,950
hundreds of messages long very hard to

1220
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:40,650
follow the threads<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was on one of those</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm the Shepherd on and I assure you</font>

1222
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:45,690
trying to be a shepherd on one of those

1223
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:48,930
to make sure that people's responses are

dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with is impossible because threads</font>

turned into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Travis I so please be clear</font>

1226
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,490
and crisp and then my last<font color="#E5E5E5"> request is if</font>

1227
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:58,319
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do what Ted just</font>

1228
00:57:55,490 --> 00:58:00,390
suggested of let's open this up please

1229
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't assume its dns off dns</font>

1230
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:04,980
has just had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of failures on</font>

1231
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,140
coming to consensus on things like this

1232
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,720
I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put Indiana stop if you</font>

1233
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:11,460
want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a failure um which is I</font>

1234
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,569
mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't guarantee a failure but we</font>

1235
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:17,099
we do actually have a thread of sorry it

1236
00:58:15,569 --> 00:58:19,890
was your clarifying question then do you

1237
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">want failure no my clarifying question</font>

1238
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:24,720
is do you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want this to happen</font>

1239
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:26,460
please consider not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the</font>

1240
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:33,240
current tools but to<font color="#CCCCCC"> create a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new tool</font>

1241
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:36,990
called a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group yadda yadda</font>

1242
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:38,640
so I I wanted to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it clear the</font>

1243
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:42,269
working of the you guys really are in

1244
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:44,368
trust you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a a project ahead of you</font>

1245
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:46,680
and you have some potential requirements

1246
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:49,559
to put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the whatever you're doing</font>

1247
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:51,930
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really really clear</font>

1248
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:54,119
about what the implications of some of

1249
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:56,279
those requirements are so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide</font>

1250
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:58,619
to go a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> path and that means a</font>

1251
00:58:56,279 --> 00:59:02,789
very lengthy process somewhere else

1252
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:04,920
outside the ITF and uncertain results if

1253
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:08,279
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then you know by all means</font>

1254
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,269
but but don't test you know pick a

1255
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:12,509
particular direction without

1256
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:14,669
understanding the implications so I

1257
00:59:12,509 --> 00:59:18,539
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're there are some reasonable</font>

1258
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:22,880
choices ahead of us but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1259
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:22,880
make a sensible choice here Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You</font>

1260
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,319
Suzanne wall fence<font color="#E5E5E5"> Denisov culture well</font>

1261
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would dispute a few of Paul Hoffman's</font>

1262
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:34,349
words as far as how Deanna's often stood

1263
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:36,180
on some of these questions I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1264
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:37,920
important to note that one of the things

1265
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's come out of the inquiry on dns op</font>

1266
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,970
is that many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the issues arising are</font>

1267
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,220
out of scope and out of confidence for

1268
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:45,959
deanna's off these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not strictly dns</font>

1269
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,660
issues they just express themselves in

1270
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way so the clarifying question for</font>

1271
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:54,089
the working group given the process and

1272
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,890
operational discussions that seem to

1273
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:58,859
arise from this do you want to wait

1274
00:59:55,890 --> 01:00:03,750
literally indefinitely for a resolution

1275
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:05,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this because last</font>

I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ETF I mean it sounds like we're</font>

1277
01:00:05,789 --> 01:00:11,880
repeating this<font color="#E5E5E5"> same set of options and</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group you know knew that it</font>

1279
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,440
was walking into something that

1280
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,630
might be difficult in order to get the

1281
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that it really wanted and it was</font>

1282
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:22,100
given the option oh we could take this

1283
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:23,330
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> did that aqua version not</font>

1284
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,400
really what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want it could be more</font>

1285
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:28,130
expedient that was the heart of the

1286
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:30,980
discussion last time and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just went</font>

1287
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and reread the notes it was we</font>

1288
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:36,470
decided to go the the longer harder

1289
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,410
route in order to get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that we</font>

1290
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:43,399
felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like was you know really the best</font>

1291
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:46,299
option for our you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> community what</font>

1292
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:51,710
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened but what's different from</font>

1293
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:55,700
last IETF to this idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> just if you know</font>

1294
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:57,710
what's the difference the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF the iesg</font>

1295
01:00:55,700 --> 01:01:02,960
in the IAB have had more painful

1296
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:05,030
conversation since then that's what the

1297
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,980
working group as yari said we're in

1298
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">charge that's what the worrying group</font>

1299
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:18,020
working group asked the I star to do on

1300
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:21,560
our behalf based on our consensus this

1301
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:24,200
is andrew sullivan so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to I'm</font>

1302
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking with no hat just even though my</font>

1303
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,149
hat is like fading away I just want to

1304
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:31,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">be clear that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think Stephen no hat um</font>

1305
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:33,620
I want to quibble actually with both

1306
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,080
yari and the statement you just made the

1307
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:38,210
working group is not in charge this is

1308
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:41,299
an ietf document it's going to go to

1309
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:43,040
IETF consensus so I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you that</font>

1310
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,020
this working groups consensus has not

1311
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,120
changed and I don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

1312
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:49,910
why we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to re-explore this rat hole</font>

1313
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:53,569
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mic line here but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want</font>

1314
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:55,640
people to to believe even for a second

1315
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:57,470
that working group consensus gets to

1316
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,940
determine what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> etf consensus is</font>

1317
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:03,350
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not how this organization</font>

1318
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:05,600
works so so I I mean it might be that

1319
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:07,700
the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> director is asking are you</font>

1320
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,860
really sure you want to go to IETF last

1321
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,450
call on with this because you might find

1322
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:14,810
yourself in a bun fight<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you have</font>

1323
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:16,520
enough funds but um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care about</font>

1324
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but I completely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1325
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,940
that this working group has already made

1326
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,680
its decision thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1327
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:25,010
clarification don't want to suggest for

1328
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:27,140
a second that the IETF is not ultimately

1329
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:29,590
in charge here

1330
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:32,330
I misspoke a little bit uh the the

1331
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:34,520
consensus of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group was clear</font>

1332
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:39,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think now we're saying the same</font>

1333
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:41,660
thing jumping up oh yeah sorry um Terry

1334
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:45,380
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is hopefully just a clarifying</font>

1335
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:47,060
question is it in an email to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a small</font>

1336
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:49,250
group a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few days ago you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1337
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:51,380
believe that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we leave the request me</font>

1338
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:54,200
insecure delegation in but we will not

1339
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:56,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> publish the RFC until that is</font>

1340
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,609
resolved is there an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1341
01:02:56,330 --> 01:03:04,460
perhaps to publish where we are not

1342
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:07,160
blocking on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

1343
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:10,280
I won't say a hundred percent but it's

1344
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:12,129
possible remove the insecure delegation

1345
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:16,460
you're not then trying to push something

1346
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:18,740
into another entities registry and

1347
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:22,010
you're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1348
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:28,540
special-use domain and to date<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've not</font>

1349
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:32,690
seen anything substantive in terms of

1350
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:34,790
the 6761 review to say that that can't

1351
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:39,410
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wasn't quite what I was able</font>

1352
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:41,840
it was could we at least leave mention

1353
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:45,890
of the desire for an insecure delegation

1354
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:50,420
in there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think not in an ionic</font>

1355
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:53,480
considerations<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so if you took that</font>

1356
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:55,640
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ionic considerations and put</font>

1357
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,380
it somewhere else to say at some point

1358
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:01,940
in time it might be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> lovely to</font>

1359
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:04,190
have my pony arm yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that might</font>

1360
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:06,920
be a way forward but again we're in a

1361
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:08,830
fluid state right now and do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1362
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,990
one of considerations for us is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1363
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:13,970
insecure delegation is only required in

1364
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:16,729
the what's currently exceedingly rare

1365
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:19,009
case of a validation stub resolver these

1366
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:23,120
things are more like unicorns just open

1367
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:26,740
ponies<font color="#CCCCCC"> um yeah I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very</font>

1368
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:28,970
important that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do get a domain</font>

1369
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:30,589
reserved as soon as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:32,390
that be got home that's all got home<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1371
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:35,570
offer I think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font>

1372
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:37,609
unfortunate if we yep if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

1373
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:39,820
process was delayed because of that need

1374
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:41,710
from this cure delegation

1375
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:44,650
but I do also feel it's important as a

1376
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:47,440
working group that we somehow at least

1377
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:48,340
flag this is our ability of this not

1378
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,500
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the only people</font>

1379

1405
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:01,300
separated and a bunch of code starts

1406
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:03,460
getting deployed with just home yet and

1407
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,780
then we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out as after we developed</font>

the process that we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font>

01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:10,690
the root zone entry for home net then

01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:12,580
we're stuck we can't go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> really and</font>

1411
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:16,150
take back all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those deployed devices</font>

1422
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:41,440
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of scope for this discussion</font>

1423
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,310
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to record the</font>

01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">deadhead had been discussing that way</font>

1425
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:47,680
Ted lemon so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

1426
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:50,200
going to believe this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a clarifying</font>

1427
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,720
question or not but and if it's not

1428
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:57,189
that's fine but

1429
01:06:52,720 --> 01:07:00,529
is it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it generally understood that</font>

1430
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:03,560
regardless of what the outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

1431
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:05,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion is we need to have the</font>

1432
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,670
discussion with I can about precisely

1433
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:09,110
what the MOU says or do people really

1434
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:12,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">just not want to open that can of worms</font>

1435
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:15,080
I mean is that what's going on I can't

1436
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:21,200
speak to that so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> earn the MOU</font>

1437
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:22,880
I'm sorry I believe there are there are

1438
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">nope Angie's going to come to the mic</font>

1439
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:28,970
thank you my name is Andrew Sullivan and

1440
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:33,290
I am NOT the chair of the IEP but I'm

1441
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:36,859
still on the IAB for four days<font color="#E5E5E5"> left and</font>

1442
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:39,259
I am quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that there is no</font>

1443
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:41,690
appetite to reopen an agreement where

1444
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:43,700
another party might have a very

1445
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:45,350
different opinion about what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1446
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:49,069
do what we ought to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do there</font>

1447
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:51,200
then then we might think when you have

1448
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:52,760
an agreement and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to reopen that</font>

1449
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,950
agreement and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to start</font>

1450
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:57,590
negotiating anything goes on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font>

1451
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:59,629
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you if you want to reopen an</font>

1452
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:00,530
agreement with somebody the possibility

1453
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:03,110
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're going to end up</font>

1454
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:04,550
negotiating for something and you're

1455
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to give something up and</font>

1456
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:07,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what it is you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

1457
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:10,040
up in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this benefit if you</font>

1458
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:12,169
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but um you know you're</font>

1459
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:15,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to reopen some things wide</font>

1460
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:16,550
in order to do that so so if that's the

1461
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:18,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion that people want to have</font>

1462
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,310
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all I'm quite sure that this is</font>

1463
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:23,000
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group of which it ought</font>

1464
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:24,980
to be done and um and secondly I'm not

1465
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,960
really sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want the result that</font>

1466
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:29,389
we're asking for their because it could

1467
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">be quite interest I mean it seems to</font>

1468
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:32,840
lemon again it seems from my perspective

1469
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:34,819
that if you if that's the approach that

1470
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">we take than what we're really saying is</font>

1471
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:38,269
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MOU has effectively been</font>

1472
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,940
negotiated away from what it actually

1473
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:43,520
says and because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to</font>

1474
01:08:40,939 --> 01:08:45,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">know now I'm sorry maybe a valid thing</font>

1475
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:49,030
to do I'm gonna jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> in as ad here this</font>

1476
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:49,029
is off topic of scope

1477
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:57,969
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cheshire listening to this</font>

1478
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:59,920
discussion to something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> puzzles me</font>

1479
01:08:57,969 --> 01:09:03,009
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if there's some</font>

1480
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:05,920
mistake in thinking going on I'm hearing

1481
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:10,330
that in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this work we need</font>

1482
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:13,810
the insecure delegation but the idea

1483
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:16,689
behind the special use names registry

1484
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:19,000
was that there are certain parts of the

1485
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:22,089
namespace that have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> properties</font>

1486
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,979
and the idea was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually codify that</font>

1487
01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:26,109
and have a place you could look to find

1488
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:28,238
out what those properties are now in

1489
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:31,150
this case what we're saying is dome net

1490
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:33,309
has these special properties and and

1491
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:35,618
then while we're saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're also</font>

1492
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:38,020
saying but we want validating stub

1493
01:09:35,618 --> 01:09:42,670
resolvers to continue to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

1494
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:45,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> code changes and and in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1495
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:48,489
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing in the in</font>

1496
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:50,738
the root<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone to make that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1497
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:53,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole point of having something in</font>

1498
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:54,968
the special use name registry to say

1499
01:09:53,109 --> 01:10:00,340
hang on a second different rules apply

1500
01:09:54,969 --> 01:10:03,460
to this so if the people running the

1501
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:06,310
root zone wanted to put in an insecure

1502
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:09,190
delegation as a pragmatic thing to make

1503
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:11,110
legacy code work without<font color="#E5E5E5"> you changes</font>

1504
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:13,599
that might be a decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

1505
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:15,369
make but it in no way<font color="#E5E5E5"> affects our</font>

1506
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,770
ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this name has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1507
01:10:15,369 --> 01:10:19,239
following special properties and if you

1508
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:23,619
are writing a validating stub resolver

1509
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:25,540
and you can play with this RFC you ought

1510
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware of those special properties</font>

1511
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:28,420
and treat this name differently because

1512
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,860
if you don't your customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

1513
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:31,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">be unhappy and they're going to disable</font>

1514
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:33,009
your software because it's breaking

1515
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:34,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">their own network I didn't see any</font>

1516
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:36,130
problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so Stewart it sounds</font>

1517
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,440
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> archit arguing that</font>

1518
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:40,690
effectively the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 67 61 application is</font>

1519
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:45,599
already kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stretch of are</font>

1520
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:45,599
chartering not to require host changes I

1521
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:51,489
guess when you put it that way yes it is

1522
01:10:48,219 --> 01:10:53,199
because if you don't require any host

1523
01:10:51,489 --> 01:10:55,000
changes you don't the name is not

1524
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">special if it's not special it needs to</font>

1525
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,730
go into the does not need to go in the

1526
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,349
registry that's kind of a circular

1527
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:02,409
argument but if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> name that</font>

1528
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:04,659
special properties it that implies<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

1529
01:11:02,409 --> 01:11:05,429
special in some way if it's not special

1530
01:11:04,659 --> 01:11:08,400
it shouldn't be

1531
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:13,080
special useless<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hopefully it's the</font>

1532
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:16,769
clarify ? mike Andrews<font color="#E5E5E5"> home it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1533
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:19,440
special the name is ambiguous that is

1534
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:22,740
what makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it special complete agreement</font>

1535
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:25,410
so it especially so that is what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1536
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:28,679
the only thing that makes it special it

1537
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:33,780
that yep there is other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fall</font>

1538
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:38,510
out of that there's nothing that in the

1539
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:42,450
special uses registry the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system that</font>

1540
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:44,580
that an unmodified machine shouldn't go

1541
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:47,790
out to work that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to actually</font>

1542
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:50,280
modify a resolver to do things with it

1543
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:51,900
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh make you know I'm gonna ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1544
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:54,509
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> is take that off your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money sorry</font>

1545
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:56,160
function is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart not i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1546
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">take ask you guys to take this offline</font>

1547
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:02,510
this is not a clarifying question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1548
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:05,310
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see one coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime insane ok</font>

1549
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:09,870
Ralph and then we should wrap up and

1550
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:11,460
decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> where all next actors okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1551
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:15,720
Terry what would you mind was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1552
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:19,050
clarification on that discussion so so

1553
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,520
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> step is I think watch this</font>

1554
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:24,600

separate this remove the secure

1572
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:15,660

and if and we'll see if that's going to

1577
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:29,909
be the big deal that it is we should

1578
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:33,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">give the opportunity I think for the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">working group to allow absolutely unless</font>
