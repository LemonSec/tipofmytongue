00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,829

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,599
high-level comment was that um the

306
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,160
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> were very much sweets like we</font>

307
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,259
do this because we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

308
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,269
experiment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that's wrong what</font>

309
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:58,160
we should say is we do this because it's

310
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:01,670
the right thing to do and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

311
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,899
this open up some experiment space<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I</font>

312
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think it's about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the content it's</font>

313
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,890
really about the wording a little bit do

314
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,709
you know what I mean yeah it's a PS and

315
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:12,140
I guess the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document should last and be</font>

316
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:14,390
be seen as inspiring in future times

317
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,909
when we're not just enabling something

318
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,350
it's actually part of the spec so is

319
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:19,699
that what you're saying you change the

320
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,010
wording so it actually states what we

321
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,839
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do no route rather than</font>

322
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,789
the intention of enabling the<font color="#CCCCCC"> experiment</font>

323
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">says ill we want to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these changes</font>

324
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:28,940
because it's the right thing to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

325
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,429
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows these experiments</font>

326
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,940
afterwards yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well yes we work</font>

327
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:37,370
offline on wording of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is</font>

328
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,710
guilty as charged<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of the most part i</font>

329
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,840
left the ration rationale for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

experiments to the underlying paragraphs

and sound like vehicle and just nothing

332
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,080
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rationale to explain why these</font>

333
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,110
changes ought to be made in principle

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">hmm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll try to work i'll try to work</font>

335
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:55,280
wording the<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes so but what</font>

336
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,440
I'm saying is basically should even talk

337
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,520
less about the experiments and more

338
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the</font>

339
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:06,379
general rationals behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mmm okay</font>

340
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:08,060
okay so as I said we'll do in your

341
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,710
revision then and then we'll we'll ask

342
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:16,379
the working group for cards okay thank

343
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:17,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you Mira no problem oh no what no</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">excitement ah I have a slight nod you've</font>

346
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:37,160
been talking about it ah yeah that's

<font color="#E5E5E5">good hello I'm umm Lulu this is a</font>

352
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,640
good rather than can ask questions at

353
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,970
the end then or answered the meeting and

354
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:09,320
this is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Laura effort / hot</font>

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,210
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the beginning and this is</font>

357
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:17,150
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the law a pit / hot behavior the</font>

358
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,570
hot behavior that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define</font>

359
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will enable scavenger class or a</font>

lower priority service through the

361
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,920
internet and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

362
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:32,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core point in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dscp land so forward</font>

363
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:35,150
please and the goal of this is to

364
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:39,350
obsolete the recommendations on use of

365
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:41,480
cs one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this class and we've done a</font>

366
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:45,110
number of updates from zero zero two

367
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:48,710
zero one and largely result of feedback

368
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,939
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group one of the things</font>

369
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">we added was the requirement that</font>

370
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,820
congestion control should be used with

371
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the PHP so a scavenger class and</font>

372
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,240
application actually has a congestion

373
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,190
control appropriate to that and that's

374
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">really useful if the dscp doesn't</font>

375
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,660
survive the path or you don't receive

376
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,399
the / hot behavior expect so that's a

377
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,820
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport recommendation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

378
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> rudy good guide also make</font>

379
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,679
suggestions

380
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,480
about what to do about the dropping

381
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,870
precedence for the scavenger class

382
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,000
traffic and and that wording has been

383
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:27,919
revised so there's no shoulds indicating

384
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:31,760
its relation to other<font color="#E5E5E5"> DSC PS and yeah</font>

385
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:36,950
and 2119 language was added in various

386
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:40,390
places and it brings us back to the

387
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:43,250
recommendations in section 5 and we

388
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:46,040
don't recommend dscp bleaching that's

389
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:51,440
where you reset the<font color="#E5E5E5"> diff circle point 20</font>

390
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:54,889
and but there's two different semantics

391
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,440
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ellie what to do and whether to</font>

392
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">remarket to be is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay or whether to</font>

393
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:11,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">only transmit it and if the pH be</font>

394
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:13,610
supported and we could use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to s2 DSC PS</font>

395
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,320
that might be useful that's not

396
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,669
currently in the draft and you're a

397
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,310
number of things here the working group

398
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,800
can make comments on will come later to

399
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:25,310
which DSC PS we might think<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best for</font>

400
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,290
this service but maybe we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font>

401
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:30,139
one as a possibility the current

402
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:39,909
suggestion is just to use one and let's

403
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:44,480
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> next line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s domain that uses dscp</font>

405
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of odd because CS</font>

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:53,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones actually higher than cs0 but that</font>

407
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:58,160
was incorporated into a RFC some time

408
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,110
ago and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 45 94 largely as a result of</font>

409
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet to experience when they just</font>

410
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,590
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call point that worked and</font>

411
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,900
they chose one that worked and that's

412
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a certain number of problems and not</font>

413
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:12,440
least the fact that when you go fire a

the old toss marking semantics it can

00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,580
remove the top three bits 0 angles I'm

417
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:24,700
end up with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very strange</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> core point</font>

419
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:31,870
text has changed but and yeah read read

420

section 60 explicitly wats changes

421

respect to 459 point<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and then we</font>

422
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,150
have some comments from<font color="#E5E5E5"> David black</font>

00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,980
networks in general and networks with

425
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,660
full support of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ally and we probably</font>

426
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,800
have work to do this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a document</font>

427
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,830
that's finish it's a document that needs

428
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:54,040
people to read it the must remark

429
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:56,320
requirement and needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be discussed in</font>

430
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,889
section 5 I guess their bid will discuss

431
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,689
this yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what I do is if you're</font>

432
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,100
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring up your your slides from</font>

433
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,870
map Margie or something like it later

434
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,669
let's do it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that context so this is</font>

435
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:10,689
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a transition concern</font>

436
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:13,510
it's fairly easy to put musts on new

437
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:17,080
usage this is must on deployed running

438
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:21,580
code which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a little interesting yeah</font>

439
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,810
okay um and what whatever we do we got

440
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,350
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the eye on the considerations</font>

441
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,669
correct and all these things will be

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:32,980
incorporated into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next version</font>

not how how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the less than best</font>

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,810
different opinions that's been discussed

456
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:14,980
on the list but nothing really is come

457
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:22,330
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that so that's something that</font>

458
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:24,130
still needs to be talked about and then

459
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:27,220
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice of which dscp to use</font>

460
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:30,160
for this new class we needed the SCP to

461
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,440
market traffic and there were two

462
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,800
proposals originally proposal number one

463
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,150
was used dscp for paul's number two was

464
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,270
wind used dscp to

465
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">and of these two dscp 21 the beauty</font>

466
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:48,170
contest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that still has problems and</font>

467
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,480
one good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about dscp to is its</font>

468
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:53,390
allocated from the pool<font color="#CCCCCC"> ending with zero</font>

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,850
which is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> anna allocated google for</font>

470
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,440
standards action drafts so when this

471
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,169
becomes our AC<font color="#E5E5E5"> anna commit that</font>

472
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,510
allocation and it shouldn't be bleached

473
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,030
by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> toss bleacher because our ta's</font>

474
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:07,250
lecture that removes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros the first</font>

475
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,899
three bits of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will make</font>

these three bits 0 when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

were<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 and therefore the cold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

478
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:17,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">survived so it's got good survivability</font>

479
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:21,560
and is there a better choice well then

480
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:24,740
maybe because this bleaching that i

481
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,620
mentioned causes other problems to other

482
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:31,340
traffic which means that other the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scps</font>

483
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:35,149
currently get remarked to the value<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

484
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:37,879
as they pass through the insula this is

485
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:40,550
kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a nightmare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

486
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,290
the me at least it means and something

487
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,899
good to measure so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk in</font>

488
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:47,270
mahadji about some measurements we've

489
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,520
done to try and start off figuring out

490
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:51,710
what happens when you use dscp to and

491
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,990
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it get through i can tell you</font>

492
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,210
immediately the answer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes just do</font>

493
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,580
you receive other traffic with dscp<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

494
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:01,010
apart from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones which try to set it</font>

495
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes under an awful lot of</font>

496
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic if you go through the current</font>

497
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:08,150
internet so and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

498
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,879
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> description here is do</font>

499
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:14,930
we pick a different code point to

500
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:19,790
another one that it i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an ERG</font>

501
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:23,600
presentation is does a does dhcp to get

502
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:26,149
bleach to all zeros the answer is bad

503
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,980
eighty ninety percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> no but more than</font>

504
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,980
ten percent yes which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is enough to pay</font>

505
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,150
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is why you you</font>

506
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">really need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a congestion control</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> running with this traffic classic</font>

508
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:42,830
the class of traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I think</font>

509
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the debate and probably the</font>

510
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,750
mahadji presentation should go ahead

511
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:51,920
before we do something David what you on

512
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:55,010
do no comments welcome map RG

513
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,720
tations very important my surgeon

514
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,570
reaction to all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is first of all</font>

515
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,310
kudos to gori<font color="#CCCCCC"> gori and students for</font>

516
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:06,350
doing this actual measurements of

517
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:08,510
running code Wow quick round and one of

518
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,179
the issues here is does the IETF no

519
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:13,070
design something and to work in the real

520
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,870
internet or do we just pretend that

521
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:18,950
could point to have it being allocated

522
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:22,250
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there boy isn't used that last one</font>

523
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:25,460
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real tricky question well not I</font>

524
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:28,790
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest the the solution</font>

525
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I propose would propose it would be</font>

526
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,990
to assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that too is the right answer</font>

527
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,580
and then try and inventory the amount of

528
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,110
harm that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen from things</font>

529
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that don't aren't compatible with that</font>

530
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:42,139
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'm sorry I didn't see that this</font>

531
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,399
draft was on the agenda or I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

532
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,720
read it because this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

533
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,760
this is actually one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

534
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">think is a huge missed opportunity for</font>

535
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,430
the IETF and one of the things that

536
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,940
would buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a huge amount of additional</font>

537
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:58,460
capacity we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these things in</font>

538
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,260
our pockets which are often using prime

539
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,940
data to update when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should be</font>

540
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:05,720
updating at three in the morning and the

541
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,690
total<font color="#E5E5E5"> load just on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> especially in</font>

542
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,430
the southern hemisphere is massive and

543
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:14,720
and doing it right would make a huge

544
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:16,130
difference I'm 11 minor technical

545
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,590
question which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't paying attention</font>

546
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:21,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would have read is there a spec</font>

547
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:25,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the passive open loops back the bit</font>

548
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:27,949
the marking oh that would be lovely how

549
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:31,550
are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do that the TCP we could</font>

550
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,350
do it I'll be yes I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in that</font>

551
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:36,680
but the spec doesn't have a way of doing

552
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:38,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially that one sentence is seems to</font>

553
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,910
be out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scope on everybody's document</font>

554
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:46,190
and that one sentence is very important

555
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:48,020
um and although it's still a little bit

556
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,580
tricky with the stp because just because

557
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,160
you market just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and it gets those</font>

558
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,840
two doesn't mean anybody actually treats

559
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in the way that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too is meant to be</font>

560
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,970
treated<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand that's one of the</font>

561
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,260
weird applying in the real world but but

562
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,970
the fact is you have to you have to

563
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,080

565
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:11,110
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the particular concern is for</font>

566
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:13,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance for uploading software if I</font>

568

the foreground if it runs on a timer at

569
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,149
three in the morning I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do it in</font>

570
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,649
the background and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to the application</font>

571
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:22,789
is the only thing that has a scope for

572
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:27,918
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> well how that bit should be set</font>

573
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:33,649
yeah he are either the TC p.m. chairs

574
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:37,639
here Michael Scharf<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because Matt</font>

575
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:41,178
my reaction to that question is if I

576
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:43,519
passive open we mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP passive open</font>

577
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:49,399
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to wind up as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp em</font>

578
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:51,230
topic if we mean a quick quick whatever

579
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:52,939
quick is going is is going to do is kind

580
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,070
of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to wind up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

581
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">so how language is different with the</font>

582
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,090
semantics are the same the point is if

583
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,529
you're a server and a client connects to

584
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,629
you you want to echo whatever you

585
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:05,539
thought the client said the other hand

586
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:08,690
I'm hard put to recommend a drill a hole

587
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:09,980
RFC for one sentence much it well even

588
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,139
though if you are saying them so this

589
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,760
sentence has no scope and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the others the</font>

590
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:17,209
other one sentence that doesn't have any

591
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,158
scope that is that is very similar is if

592
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,740
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP you should really turn</font>

593
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:24,529
on don't fragment that sentence is also

594
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:28,100
missing everywhere no idea what do like

595
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:29,870
DF but I the ecn sentences could be

596
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">carried in this draft we just have to</font>

597
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,459
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that those two working groups</font>

598
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,220
had a good hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it at work or</font>

599
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,690
glass call time I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could but I'm</font>

600
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,200
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that's necessarily the right</font>

601
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,519
thing to do in this draft and it might

602
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:53,029
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right thing to do though in the</font>

603
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:54,380
idea me I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been I mean</font>

604
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:56,029
actually you should know better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I</font>

605
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,649
do but I mean the measurements you did

606
00:30:56,029 --> 00:31:00,380
where you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just using trace road and</font>

607
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:01,820
you get if you would get back icmp you

608
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,460
have the information you've been asking

609
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,769
for unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see if he doesn't</font>

610
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:14,270
work very well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's what you</font>

611
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:16,530
want yeah sure I'm okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um any other</font>

612
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:20,790
questions on this draft

613
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:25,110
I will come as an individual that I

614
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:28,830
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt's preferred approach to this</font>

615
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:30,600
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feels like the right feels</font>

616
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a good enough answer though I'm not</font>

617
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna not not going to say it's got to</font>

618
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,940
be that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing figure out we think</font>

619
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right answer is and work towards it</font>

620
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,560
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example we might want to won't want</font>

621
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to invoke gifts or architecture</font>

622
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,040
basically say if you're going to use

623
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:46,080
this then you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the traffic</font>

624
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,470
conditioning at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the at all the edges</font>

625
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:57,240
network as opposed to just as opposed to

626
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:59,850
just shouldn't pray and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 as</font>

00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,030
little iono allocation question but when

00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:23,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see my talk in my power you'll</font>

632
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:26,340
discover it works amazingly well cool so

633
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,229
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok back and the chair now sought</font>

634
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,090
enough three girls at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I read this</font>

scavenger for a long time we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have</font>

637
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:42,330
written this draft like 10 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago 20</font>

638
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:44,010
years ago well Matt's older me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

639
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,649
should written this draft quite some

640
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:49,170
considerable time ago and something's

641
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:51,990
changed significantly and people are

642
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:54,540
really deploying networks that can carry

643

<font color="#CCCCCC">dscp s through them there's a lot of</font>

00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,840
work to get that fully deployed knows a

645
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,080
good opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually write this</font>

646

00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:13,640
penis should both put<font color="#CCCCCC"> procedure the</font>

working group class altogether are can

720
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:22,910
this be handled separately that's the

721
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:24,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">less I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see ok so my preference and I</font>

for these has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been to working a blast</font>

724
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:32,390
called player because they're

725
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:35,270
fundamentally about the same class<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

ecn mechanism in two different contexts

727
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:40,849
and I prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply to the last column</font>

728
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,970
as a pair that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we can we can get</font>

understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you just said correctly</font>

731
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:53,569
nothing's waiting on the main ecn<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>
