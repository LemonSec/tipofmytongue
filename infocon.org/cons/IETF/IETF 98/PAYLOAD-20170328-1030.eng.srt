40
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,820
kind of proposal for fixes for certain

41
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,340
things I mean if see this document has

42
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:03,470
been at 11 hundred and sixty some days

43
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,850
since it was approved so it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> aged</font>

44
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,130
there were a couple of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> which need</font>

45
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,500
to be dressed and etcetera so it's gonna

46
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,650
be changes and I I waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,430
updated version but we might have to

48
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,110
circulate something on the mailing list

49
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,680
before it's difficult because there's

50
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,360
some changes to some things here so but

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">what on the propeller we don't want me</font>

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,380
to to get it back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a formal review</font>

53
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,670
what's this yeah so I I think you want

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">to inform a working group of what's</font>

55
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:36,670
being changed here because there's the

56
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:40,040
are changes so it's that does impact a

57
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:43,910
Content some degree etc there's several

58
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:49,609
edits to it in regards to note about for

59
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:51,769

65
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,559
have to you at least show it to working

66

everyone who's writing payload because

85
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,970
we could as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is reassuring we got</font>

86
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,979
requests about how to do that I would

87
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,590
always point to this document whatever

88
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:02,539
because it had the structure of how to

89
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,609
write a tale of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> veteran support it</font>

90
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:06,949
doesn't matter it was an RFC or it was a

91
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,949
working group document which was already

92
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:14,020
as the right content in which how to

93
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:16,520
derive a specification and payload yeah

94
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:21,609
and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for this work because it's</font>

95
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:27,080
important thing for this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

96
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:29,870
the ancillary pay no teasing was in the

97
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,229
is a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> G processing but there were</font>

98
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:36,440
changes in the documents which are not a

99
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:40,130
deterrent did some changes on day even

100
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:43,009
in the payload header had to do

101
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:46,130
something with alignment and and they

102
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,199
change the structure so if we there

103
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">would submit a new revision and the</font>

104
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,080
document will come back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working</font>

105
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,020
group for working for another way to

106
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,580
class code because we need to go through

107
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,729
we still see<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see that if we also</font>

108
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,520
need afterwards a ITF last code that's

109
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,880
something that when we mentioned on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

110
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,359
very least when we discussed the issue

111
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,190
right so we are waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a revision</font>

112
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,870
and by the way all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes that</font>

113
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">they were damn also based and they were</font>

114
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,830
check your answer from implementation

115
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,250
that you don't break any implementation

116
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:22,099
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> get would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

117
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,690
changes right it's like a typical

118
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,810
payment where we get the payload from

119
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,850
that done that we are being used others

120
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,030
bodies and we just need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to the</font>

121
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,710
process and see that the tailor that

122
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,090
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> awaited the document is structure</font>

123
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,280
then the content makes sense and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

124
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,159
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so expect to see a</font>

125
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:45,590
working-class goal as we get a new

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:52,310
revision for that one other burn status

127
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:55,340
the vp9 RTP payload Jareth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

128
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's leads first of all he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did burn</font>

129
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,659
work and the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said</font>

130
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:04,660
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about support for me and so</font>

131
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,660
the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there's a bunch of</font>

132
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,830
texts basically the explanatory text

133
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,440
about sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of getting the back on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vp9</font>

134
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,580
overview of its high level structure and

135
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,840
whatnot which nobody's written yet um

136
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,639
and I thought I had a volunteer to help

137
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,650
me write that but yes in either so we

138
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,320
will try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that than the other</font>

139
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,599
thing mrs. a bus much more significant

140
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,150
tactical change is that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to</font>

141
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,050
somebody the other day who expressed

142
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:38,659
some interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in using he mentioned oh</font>

143
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,640

145
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,900
and I thought oh no that means i have to

146
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,419
support mr mt mode and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want any</font>

147
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:52,729
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to support mrng mt mode so</font>

148
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:57,349
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is do we right now we only</font>

149
00:07:52,729 --> 00:08:01,490
support srst for the scale bowl is their

150
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:08,030
interest in mr MP or mrs t modes for

151
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:11,330
this I guess mrs t know mrs to you

152
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,609
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> well i guess the question would</font>

153
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,690
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know that i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i had some</font>

154
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,289
recollection there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> perk</font>

155
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:23,360
architectures that one at mrs t but i'm

156
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:26,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure but i guess you don't really</font>

157
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,060
need that with with frame marking but ya

158
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:32,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">mar so I guess the question is do we</font>

159
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:35,780
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to delay this do the work for mr mt</font>

160
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,130
because I I don't want it so maybe the

161
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,490
answer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if in the future somebody</font>

162
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,469
wants at mr mt we can define it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a bit</font>

163
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,740
sir and the alternative<font color="#E5E5E5"> payload format</font>

164
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:48,290
so with his royal infirmary basically

165
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,690
you have to explain how you reassemble

166
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,579
the original decoding order across

167
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:58,100
multiple streams know in this thing

168
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,570
basically I'll host what he wants to do

169
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,130
I mean he's not even sure he wants to

170
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,810
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> our GP for what he's doing yet so</font>

171
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:06,130
it's a very early<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement basically</font>

172
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:09,439
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he wants to do very do actual</font>

173
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,000
multicast streaming where you you know

174
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,649
where what you actually want to turn

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,480
into tuning to the multicast group

176
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:16,910
corresponding to the layers you want so

177
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would require mr mt that's the</font>

178
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:23,810
original motivation for all the MRRT

179
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:26,630
modes<font color="#E5E5E5"> is multicast yeah okay yeah which</font>

180
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,640
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still 0 so okay yeah so when my</font>

181
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,860
inclination would be to say let's just

182
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it with the single stream mode for</font>

183
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,270
now and then do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this or alternate</font>

184
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,760
versions of pillow for my authority

185
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:40,459
wanza if you could be who we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> him in</font>

186
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,200
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future but the but excited okay so</font>

187
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:47,739
but you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> loose policy look so</font>

188
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:50,120
people on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah because um</font>

189
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,640
assume the guy who wanted he's not clear

190
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,750
no no he's a I mean yeah I'd I'm not

191
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,699
sure he even realized that was a

192
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,440
distinction we need to worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font>

193
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,089
was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying he wanted to look at how</font>

194
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,980
I mean he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTP is</font>

195
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the level where way he wants to go for</font>

196
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,890
this it might be some entirely different

197
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,510
structure yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> because in students not</font>

198
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,180
necessarily off between exactly yeah

199
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:10,130
just repurpose oh yeah so when so i

200
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,959
think i said i'm probably very glad not

201
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:16,220
to that men tim was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one who had</font>

202
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,739
volunteered to help me write it but i

203
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,930
guess he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not here now so i will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

204
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,120
either bug him or my co-authors to see

205
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,529
if one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> can write that</font>

206
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,740
explanatory text<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're working</font>

207
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:30,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the toilet in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to last</font>

208
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:34,550
hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the other documents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

209
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:37,970
have in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> workgroup is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vc to high</font>

210
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:40,880
quality and it is a new Glascow probably

211
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:44,320
we don't have enough in here so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

212
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,510
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to see how to finish this one</font>

213
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,560
currently there's no other documents

214
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,560
there so the milestone you have a

215
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,329
milestone that

216
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:02,760
already expiring now about the North be

217
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:05,070
flexible fact there for a flexible back

218
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:10,350
and probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> update</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and see how</font>

219
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:12,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attract what is the new milestone for</font>

220
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,360
the vp9 will also need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update because</font>

221
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:19,680
we are working for revision and they

222
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:23,490
hope to be able to send a<font color="#E5E5E5"> VC to high</font>

223
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">quality for publication by lake so these</font>

224
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:31,350
are Bionic monsters for this working

225
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:36,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so this is the any question any</font>

226
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:40,050
other issues on the fidelity yeah yeah

227
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's how a girl from india if we have</font>

00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,370
but a proposal for external effects

230
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,200
frame which is in fact closely related

231
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the presentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will act to the</font>

246
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,620
in here and it's what we've shown is

247

250
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:06,009
updates the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flex draft behalf of</font>

251
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:10,079
phrenology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gary next slide please ok</font>

252
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:16,199
so I'm we're going to jump is any better

253
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:21,878
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so in a flex fake version for</font>

254
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:25,769
there's a three main changes the first

255
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:30,699
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the SSRC count remember</font>

256
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:33,100
before we had a single SRC protection

257
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:39,248
and then forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> equals in version 2 we</font>

258
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:42,129
added multiple SRC protection from from

259
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:44,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java room thomas edwards volunteered</font>

260
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:47,619
to review the vc q HQ a draft for from

261
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:55,629
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> festival thomas edwards volunteered</font>

262
00:13:47,619 --> 00:14:00,699
review he's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VCH DC to HQ okay okay</font>

263
00:13:55,629 --> 00:14:03,759
so um an earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> version we extended the</font>

264
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:06,429
flux back draft to support protecting

265
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:10,029
multiple sources streams so with the

266
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:13,410
single effect stream you can protect

267
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:17,920
multiple SSR<font color="#E5E5E5"> seas and when we did that</font>

268
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:20,980
it expanded the payload format quite a

269
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,618
bit and so we've been we've worked at

270
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,809
reduced that in this version and so

271
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:28,149
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually moved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the those vests RC</font>

272
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:30,639
count and the list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are seized and</font>

273
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:34,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i TP is advert forever</font>

274
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:43,869
and it reduces the overhead by by a

275
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:45,160
32-bit word andrew is on a comment each

276
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:48,600
of these a living more detail about a

277
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">man so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> giving a list of them</font>

278
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:58,118
next next change was a suggestion to

279
00:14:53,559 --> 00:15:01,360
remove the final extension bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> mccabe it</font>

280
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:02,949
extends the mask length so you can start

281
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
off with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 16 bit mask and then you can</font>

282
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:06,420
extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to a 32 bit mask</font>

283
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,560
then you extend it to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 bit mask and</font>

284
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,880
the that cabe it was extending each one

285
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,510
of those masks and there was a

286
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,090
suggestion to remove it from the last

287
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:21,120
final largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> mask and so we saw him a</font>

288
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,800
reason to resist that it precludes

289
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,270
having larger masks in the future but I

290
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:30,300
think we're fine with having 110 packets

291
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:33,750
so so we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so now now that limit</font>

292
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:37,859
is 110 packets one flex effect packet

293
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:42,330
can cover up to 110 source packets from

294
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:45,680
that one SRC and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what was just</font>

295
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:49,500
discussed in the previous ABT session

296
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,180
there there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh some complexities</font>

297
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,060
around when you use srtp in fact

298
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,390
together which one you do first and so

299
00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:00,859
we added some text that specifies the

300
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:05,460
the order and let things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perc work</font>

301
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:08,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright next slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please so the SSRC</font>

302
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:11,030
count and<font color="#E5E5E5"> list this is the old format</font>

303
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,439
that was a that was used in version 3

304
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,890
you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> there there was a soc count</font>

305
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,990
field in the feck header and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

306
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:23,520
large wasted reserved area and then you

307
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:25,470
give each<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSRC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sfc underscore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i give</font>

308
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,939
each one of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> associes before the</font>

309
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,339
rest of the data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes with that SRC</font>

310
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,810
so the sequence number base offset and

311
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:36,480
the mask along with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this RC those would</font>

312
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,640
be repeated as blocks for each SRC that

313
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:45,600
was the old format in 03<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide</font>

314
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:47,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">please so in 04 we move to actually use</font>

315
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,940
the RTP header that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've had all along</font>

316
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,650
and that's our see list and count are

317
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,160
naturally things that are already

318
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:59,189
handled by the RTP header by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRC</font>

319
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,589
count and see SRC list so we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> moved</font>

320
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">those directly into the RTP header so</font>

321
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:06,240
basically you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these feck</font>

322
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,220
this spec packet has contributing

323
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,839
sources and here's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seas of</font>

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">those contributing sources and here's</font>

325
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,280
the count of them so it's clearly not a

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,170
mixing operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

338

start to be header which actually was

339
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,330
never documented in the old version of

340
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,178
the specs so now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have to be</font>

341
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,010
show the arts<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater and then the fact</font>

342
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,539
header which is what's documented all

343
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,370
over in the spec some people actually

344
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:53,080
confuse that to be the RTP header and

345
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:57,428
it's not this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the feck header that's</font>

346
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,678
the payload the RTP payload after arts

347
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:01,480
be header and that is where you do the

348
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:07,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">recovery operations so the source</font>

349
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:10,600
packets CC count and<font color="#CCCCCC"> csrc count and CSRC</font>

350
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,000
list and extensions and padding and all

351
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,649
those are recovered by that so it's part

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,690
of the feck header below the arts

353
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:25,330
apierror so so to cook will clarify that

354
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> art spider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and blew up top the CC</font>

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,250
there is used before it used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just be</font>

356
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,340
0 and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're actually using it to</font>

357
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,380
indicate how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many srcs are we protecting</font>

361
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:50,320
there's a corner case of whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a later slide there's a retransmission</font>

366

367
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:09,639
don't put any csr<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeds in there the</font>

rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of the feck header</font>

369
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:15,070
is the same except for just removing the

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:17,590
SSRC count field and SRC underscore I

371
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,320
field so you still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the SN base and</font>

372
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:25,059
mask and those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still repeated in</font>

effects CC equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero is invalid no</font>

377
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,610
I'll get that I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on and</font>

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,670
through other means you know through

documented that yet about whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

389
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,260
that should be allowed so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have</font>

opinions on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one case</font>

391
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:15,960
where in the retransmission format we do

392
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:20,950
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow c c equals 0 all right</font>

next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is this is that</font>

394
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:28,930
reason so in the retransmission format

395
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of the intense of the</font>

396
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,740
retransmission format was to just

397
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,930
basically send the entire RTP packet

398
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:39,400
again as this payload including its

399
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:41,020
header and so the in n 0 3 and 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4</font>

400
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,430
there's there's not a change to the

401
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,500
retransmission format but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to</font>

402
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:48,460
highlight here that this is different

403
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the regular effect format when you</font>

404
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:54,520
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRC lists because here we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

405
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:57,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">CSRC list c c equals 0 and the SSRC that</font>

406
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,560
you're protecting is in the is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

407
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,230
payload because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically</font>

408
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,909
taking the entire arts be packet that's

409
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,860
being retransmitted and sticking it in

410
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,670
as payload so you have a full 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

411
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:13,540
RTP header followed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> csrc lists and</font>

412
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:16,840
extensions and and RTP payload from the

413
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,860
original packet so this could this could

414
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,649
have been done either way we could have

415
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:23,050
required the CC equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had it</font>

416
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,330
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> csrc list and omit the s original</font>

417
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,610
SRC from the packet but it seemed like

418
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,710
unnecessary manipulation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

419
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,649
original packet when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could just</font>

420
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:36,700
blindly you know copy the entire packet

421
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:38,770
so this seemed better and actually the

422
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jonathan's earlier point about do you</font>

423
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:44,620
want to disallow c c c equals 0

424
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,590
clearly we can't for for the these

425
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,899
retransmit cases but if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to say</font>

426
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,389
that we were not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to allow c c</font>

427
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,430
equals 0 for effect cases we're only

428
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to Lau for we transmit and not fat</font>

429
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,140
cases we could actually use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font>

430
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,870
indicator of whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this is the</font>

431
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:05,530
retransmit case or the fact case and

432
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:09,340
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could even remove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the backup on</font>

433
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:11,860
slide please if you see the the first

434
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,659
two bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the feck header r the r & F</font>

436
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,610
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> F bit is whether the it's a</font>

437
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:22,530
fixed mask whether the mask is you know

438
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,530
sequence numbers or whether it's a

lengths number of columns a number of

440
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:33,429
rows so we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually remove that</font>

442
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,260
went with the restriction that CC equals

443
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,570
zero means retransmission at CC greater

444
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,610
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero means it's fact and the seat</font>

445
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,580
in the SSR sees that you're protecting

446
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,679
our signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the CSRC list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so minus</font>

447
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:53,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">banawa seeing how it looks like now I</font>

448
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:56,070
wonder about why not use different

449
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,360
payload types for the retransmission if

450
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,889
FEC because now you really have two

451
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,419
different formats and you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> feed</font>

452
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,880
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in tension about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font>

453
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,830
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PD fields and yeah now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

454
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:10,060
come back to that question again we have

455
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:12,550
kind of come full circle the original

456
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,389
intent was to use the same format but

457
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:19,149
clearly there's optimizations to be made

458
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:26,410
if you if you don't want to have the

459
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:28,600
overhead of the feck formats yeah John

460
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:31,600
panics and I guess that having to be the

461
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,429
same format does is basically say you

462
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,409
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't pick and choose you must</font>

463
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,950
implement both so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the thing we</font>

464
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,750
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say then obviously you could</font>

465
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,710
dimming you could say that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

466
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,210
they're different<font color="#CCCCCC"> pale of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types that's</font>

467
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,060
how much hard to enforce rather than

468
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,680
just saying okay well this this this

469
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,350
payload type means you support either

470
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,600
format right on receive from a purist

471
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,969
view I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would agree with Magnus that you</font>

472
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,340
know that there's logically there's

473
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,890
not a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason to buy them</font>

474
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,330
from a realist point of view from<font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font>

475
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:05,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">world implementations point of view and</font>

476
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:07,418
just you know um you know a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

477
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:11,500
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know time to get this out point</font>

478
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:16,240
of view it seems practical to have them

479
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:19,600
both and require them both and and and

480
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,049
do it here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that logically</font>

481
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,928
and I just out of purity there's not

482
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:31,120
that much justification to to have them

483
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:32,740
both once crack and so you had a big

484
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,600
have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> removed a bit for our</font>

485
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,780
retransmission<font color="#E5E5E5"> always still there no</font>

486
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,939
it's still there so the question is the

487
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:43,090
Lumia me restate Jonathan's original

488
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:47,830
question that he asked should we forbid

489
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:50,199
c c equals 0 forbid having no no no

490
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:54,610
estar sees signaled in the effect itself

491
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,780
if there's a case where we want for

492
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,250
regular effect packets not<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

493
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,899
retransmission packets but for regular

494
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,299
effect packets if there's a case where

495
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,330
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow someone to specify</font>

496
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:07,179
through some other means what the what

497
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:10,120
the sources are<font color="#E5E5E5"> see is then that would</font>

498
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:12,669
be a reason to allow c c equals 0 if we

499
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:16,658
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that as something we want to</font>

500
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:19,480
support then we can eliminate the we can

501
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:20,620
use the CC field itself to indicate

502
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,559
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's retransmission or whether</font>

503
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:26,049
it's back and eliminate the art art bit

504
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,220
from effect header so first we did

505
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:31,090
answer that first question of whether or

506
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">not we ever want to allow external means</font>

507
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,590
of signaling the relationship between

508
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,350
the feck SRC and the sort and the source

509
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,149
package associate i sell my argument for

510
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,539
keeping to our bid would be that salsa

511
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:46,980
enables you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually verify that</font>

512
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:53,590
nothing has happened to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRC list</font>

513
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:55,090
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> jonathan XD i mean i'd say one of</font>

514
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things I liked about flex track is</font>

515
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,959
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove the need for all that</font>

516
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,470
signaling associating original streams

517
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,230
and retransmission this was always<font color="#E5E5E5"> p.m.</font>

518
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:09,660
to do and so I'd much rather have the

519
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:14,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">grid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> class SRC SB in in here</font>

520
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:20,350
so so the object in this slide is

521
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:23,830
supposed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero because yes yes one</font>

522
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,780
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one we put the you didn't even</font>

523
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:29,080
put the letter for that and this one is

524
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">always do right right for ya when r is</font>

525
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,389
when r 0 it means its effect packet when

526
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,649
r is one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a retransmit packet so</font>

527
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:41,860
here it shows the symbolic instead of

528
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:43,180
the actual value<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no next one and so</font>

529
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,000
give that's the retransmission format

530
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,890
okay so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other change which is I</font>

531
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,950
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty minor we just removed the</font>

532
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:55,420
last k bit so in the biggest mask you

533
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:58,990
can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that 64 bit field of mask 46</font>

534
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:00,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">2109 who would just removed that cake k</font>

535
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,730
bit to not allow any further extension

536
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:11,430
so now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could protect up 210 packets</font>

537
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:17,230
instead 109 all right next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

538
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:20,620
srtp in fact order so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 37 11 says</font>

539
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:26,430
that when when you're using srtp that

540
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:31,659
the default order for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for operations is</font>

541
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:33,690
feck first and then srtp afterwards and

542
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:36,010
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the motivation was to have</font>

543
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:41,050
integrity protection for the for the

544
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:42,810
fact packets so that that work fine up

545
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:45,480
until we had things like perk where

546
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:49,330
Indian encryption and so middleboxes

547
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:52,120
that on that may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the</font>

548
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:54,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">fact or you can generate fact now all of</font>

549
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden can't get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because it's in</font>

550
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,350
encrypted and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the crip</font>

551
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">shin keys for that and what's notable is</font>

552
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,939
that the feck header itself is

553
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,680
considered art speed payload so you

554
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:09,280
can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle box can't even</font>

555
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,110
tell what source packets are protected

556
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,389
by this fact packet so it would have to

557
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:16,000
blindly forward all affect all the time

558
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:18,250
and would have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what what that</font>

559
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,430
fact packet is even protecting which is

560
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,520
clearly not

561
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:26,720
not optimal middle box would not be able

562
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,790
to optimally<font color="#E5E5E5"> tune affect rates and</font>

563
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,160
characteristics for each each

564
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,649
participant would have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst case</font>

565
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,690
spec for the entire conference so if one

566
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,240
person has a bad uplink everyone's a

567
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,280
downlink would get penalized so clearly

568
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,740
that's not that's not an optimal

569
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,190
situation we think that architectures

570
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,420
like Burke would benefit from having

571
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:52,720
middleboxes to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the</font>

572
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:56,990
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> and generate their own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact so the</font>

573
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,480
proposal is that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for cases where you</font>

574
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:03,470
have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like our pitchers like Burke</font>

575
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:09,200
we would require that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Flex fact</font>

576
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:11,780
order is effect after srtp so that means

577
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,660
middleboxes can receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> defect packets</font>

578
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:17,620
understand what's in the feck header and

579
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,070
and generate their own effect packets

580
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,110
differentially towards different

581
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">receivers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course everything is still</font>

582
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,280
in integrity protected because what

583
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,439
you're really recovering is the Indian

584
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:31,910
encrypted packet at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

585
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,720
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a link almost the</font>

586
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:36,950
link layer correction algorithm and the

587
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">higher</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level layers in this case would</font>

588
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">be srtp that would have to come in and</font>

589
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,169
validate the packet afterwards and do

590
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,020
the Indian authentication and encryption

591
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:52,390
why don't think yes so that means the

592
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:56,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">FEC / of the SSRC for each effect</font>

593
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:58,070
extreme for each link or each stream

594
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:01,010
would be different from the middle box

595
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:05,710
because you can't possibly reuse the

596
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:05,710
same FEC stream coming from the source

597
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,540
because then you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be rewriting</font>

598
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:14,510
sequence numbers yes but yeah that's

599
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:22,460
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but so that's one aspect the other</font>

600
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:26,030
is I'll step I had another thing so this

601
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:29,990
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> minus M I don't think you can mandate</font>

602
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:32,840
ire of them may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be either you know it so</font>

603
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,320
both can occur and depends on the

604
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,240
scenario

605
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,700
we're using it and therefore both needs

606
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,100
to be loud and actually order of equity

607
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,929
sister piece is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parameters is</font>

608

intended to be negotiated by the key

00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:47,240
management system or for configuring a

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">serta pisa now I think you you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

611
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,549
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flexible signaling for this show</font>

that this place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I have a</font>

613
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:57,379
remember how it looks if it's hard as if

614
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:01,490
I like in detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSO to pay or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not so we</font>

615
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:03,350
were neither 3711 nor this says it must

616
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,720
be this way it just says the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default</font>

617
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,340
order yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's up to a spec to</font>

618
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,139
come back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm going to override</font>

619
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default order which you know any any</font>

620
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:12,979
any crypto so we can but if it doesn't

621
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we at least want to have the</font>

622
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:18,620
default were to be correct for ya and

623
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,509
then it's it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the case where</font>

624
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's need might be the other ways I</font>

625
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:24,830
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perk is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the argument for</font>

626
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:27,350
having it anyway but I assume the fake

627
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:29,509
fix it's not unlikely be used in other

628
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:32,120
context also there where you have only

629
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:35,120
point to point and but you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

630
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:39,559
so and there you should protect the the

631
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,870
regency<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed effect packets also the you</font>

632
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:43,730
either way would would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> workable in</font>

633
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:47,029
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases it break anything but you're</font>

634
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:48,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">right that you get the extra validation</font>

635
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:53,210
of integrity protection of effect

636
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:56,269
packets yeah historically in security if

637
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:58,070
you don't integrity protect things you

638
00:31:56,269 --> 00:32:00,649
get yourself into<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble with all kinds</font>

639
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:03,168
of attacks and you might also be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

640
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:04,820
learn things like sending unprotected

00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:07,250
flex<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect packets and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of seeing</font>

642
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,990
reaction times and stuff like that some

643
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:12,009
I'm kind of concerned that this might

644
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:15,590
actually start creating security issues

645
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:17,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">but by doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it this way so so just to</font>

646
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:21,230
clarify everything would still be

647
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:23,480
integrity protected and encrypted in any

648
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,399
environment whether it's whether it's /

649
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,240
corn on park you still get integrity

650
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:31,279
protection and and in encryption of

651
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,440
anything that you wanted for the media

652
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,450
payload itself for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the effect packets</font>

653
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can think of the pic packets is just</font>

654
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,110
being almost like a line code for that

655
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,720
one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that link all you're recovering</font>

656
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,889
is the is whatever was transmitted on

657
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,950
that link you don't recover anything

658
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:46,699
about the about whether that packet was

659
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,440
authentic

660
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,420
he has stuff to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SB authentication</font>

661
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that packet after you do the thick</font>

662
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,950
recovery so the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you can do</font>

663
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:58,040
it be yeah an attack that that um that

664
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,330
forces someone to do extra extra federal

665
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,520
computation but you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that anyway</font>

666
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">so basically a Doss attack using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font>

667
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,910
but you can you can do it doesn't take

668
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,790
any with with even real meteorite or

669
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:09,890
with real package you can do a an

670
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,450
authentication attack with adults attack

671
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,760
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I send you a bunch of us RTP</font>

672
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,590
packets and because the order is is is

673
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,740
SFTP in effect you have to try to do

674
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:22,429
srtp gmac or something or you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> h</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mac</font>

675
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:25,010
to decrypt it in it's a to figure out if

676
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,470
it's authenticated so that operation can

677
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:29,180
also be you know pretty time because we

678
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,970
actually it's more time consuming than<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

679
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:35,540
or so that would even<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a harder attack</font>

680
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:37,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Victor so come back to the question that</font>

681
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,920
I had the second one was can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

682
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,080
updated 3711 from this one I don't think

683
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">so no no no we're not updating kirsten</font>

684
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,490
was this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a suspenseful what</font>

685
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,490
the default order is for this payload

686
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,610
format 3711 says that other specs can

687
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:54,650
you know you know can set their own

688
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:57,320
signal or specify their own and so here

689
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,940
we're specifying the default and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

690
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,710
Magnus is arguing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should also</font>

691
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,770
maybe figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it should be</font>

692
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,300
signaled in some other crypto sweets so

693
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,160
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to what Magnus said I think</font>

694
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,860
the whole point of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Flex fact was</font>

695
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,740
that you don't do anything out of band I

696
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:18,410
guess we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need one more bit we could say</font>

697
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:23,139
or you need to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wore order</font>

698
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:26,120
oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other question was</font>

699
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:28,129
do should we actually go through three

700
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,810
7-eleven or something that'll like that

701
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:33,100
and go and see like what attacks might

702
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:36,500
be possible on this the second bit was

703
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:39,469
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FEC header or would that be</font>

704
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,969
integrity protector or only the payload

705
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,290
that it carries so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the RTP</font>

706
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:45,109
header then you have to pack header and

707
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:51,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the the payload so I guess the</font>

708
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:53,570
payloads not protected by protected what

709
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:56,150
you mean authenticator<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eric written will</font>

710
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:59,150
be will be encrypted but it's an

711
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:00,339
excellent encrypted packet right so like

712
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,259
what you're proposing now is it

713
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:06,578
it's an exit on the encrypted packet and

714
00:35:02,259 --> 00:35:08,339
the tag is yep so you would recover a

715
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:10,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">packet that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be authenticated</font>

716
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,339
you would recover through effect

717
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:17,859
operation a packet that then needs to be

718
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:20,170
passed this RTP for authentication so

719
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:24,038
the attack of the attack vector is dose

720
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:26,739
by extra feck protection processing

721
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:29,710
before srtp authentication not going

722
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to any section of this it's going</font>

723
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be quite interesting like this one</font>

724
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:38,259
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's go through all the cases</font>

725
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure out what needs to be like the</font>

726
00:35:38,259 --> 00:35:42,150
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> property of the fact extreme</font>

727
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:51,039
Jonathan Maddox I mean it certainly for

728
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:54,519
perk<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm I agree that the effect needs</font>

729
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:59,349
to be at needs to be done after the end

730
00:35:54,519 --> 00:36:04,779
and um encryption yeah after the

731
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:08,910
undamped I'm consider the hop by hop and

732
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:12,789
I'm concerned that there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

733
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:15,098
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non perk cases a</font>

734
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:17,410
lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> architectural II tend to</font>

735
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:21,219
have the smtp processing very early<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

736
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:22,839
then repair flow stuff happening you

737
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:25,630
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> much you know significantly later</font>

738
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:27,788
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly you know all the /</font>

739
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,640
stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> state you keep that it's not the</font>

740
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:35,410
crypto state might be done rather deeper

741
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:38,650
down your pipeline so forcing this stuff

742
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:40,808
earlier is would be a hard architectural

743
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,249
trange whereas not doing this it means

744
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:48,400
that flex package to drop in replacement

745
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:49,718
for up feck or<font color="#CCCCCC"> r-tx so I'm concerned you</font>

746
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,519
know that what this change means for the

747
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:52,950
non per case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like the repair flow</font>

748
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">is for perk is sort of a hard problem</font>

749
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:56,799
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rather not like</font>

750
00:36:54,819 --> 00:37:03,069
architectural changes for non perk if we

751
00:36:56,799 --> 00:37:05,259
can avoid it hi my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gerald Piper</font>

752
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:07,239
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand half the acronyms on</font>

753
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:09,390
this slide but I heard security

754
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:12,190
percolating and I'm going to apply

755
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:14,270
cryptographer so I'm curious do you guys

756
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:17,410
care about replay attacks again

757
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:20,960
this protocol yes yes absolutely so

758
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:22,730
everything would still all<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssv</font>

759
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,100
processing would still have to happen in

760
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:27,950
either order stuff to do the full repair

761
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,960
list authentication so so underneath all

762
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:33,080
of this what what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you using to do</font>

763
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,780
this the anti replay detection and so so

764
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,120
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this doesn't specify what srtp to you</font>

765
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,980
so you could use any srtp that you know

766
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:42,470
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> using last link again</font>

767
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,600
standing library or you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

768
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:48,069
classic srtp you know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 sep 11</font>

769
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:50,540
with you know eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> a yes use the newer</font>

770
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:53,000
yes with<font color="#CCCCCC"> h make it is the newer GCM</font>

771
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:57,290
sweet that has where are those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

772
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:01,450
documented their encoding<font color="#CCCCCC"> format</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

773
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:07,279
separate our RCS in here in this group

774
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:11,689
ABT group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but not working</font>

775

776
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:23,270
baby<font color="#CCCCCC"> tico RFC's so yeah I i think the</font>

777
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:24,920
payload format should actually you could

778
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:27,950
discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but it shouldn't specified</font>

779
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,930
because it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not on on flag</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fix</font>

780
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:32,180

781
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:35,270
that you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> touching in this apt or</font>

782
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,730
to save ASAP and the configuration of

783
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:40,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">sot p and and the one of the issues that</font>

784
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:45,190
is applies to perk perfect is that

785
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">detail SS OTP defaults and has no in</font>

786
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:51,080
currently specified signal for reversing

787
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:53,360
the order of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smtp infecting that's</font>

788
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:56,090
one of the motivations for want to get

789
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,740
to get the default order right no no

790
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,110
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal i mean the birth</font>

791
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,970
order is applied on<font color="#E5E5E5"> sh IP level it's not</font>

792
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to provide on payload type level because</font>

793
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,720
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do this operation on a</font>

794
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:08,569
payload type specific level you need do

795
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,660
it because it affects how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> modernize</font>

796
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:14,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things between the RTP stack sfp</font>

797
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:16,250
module and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eve then the you need</font>

798
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:18,020
to it kind of applies to the session

799
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,060
like well are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the individual</font>

800
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,620
streams so you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be careful here</font>

801
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,990
and that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's brilliant</font>

802
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:27,230
doesn't it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> this paid informants</font>

803
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,959
role to actually try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to effect this and</font>

804
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,030
then

805
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,660
obviously Perkins too bright specks and

806
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:38,430
possibly signaling to<font color="#CCCCCC"> amanda's yeah so</font>

807
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:40,319
so we could we could leave it out of

808
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,000
this document completely but I think we

809
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">did it the document it somewhere someone</font>

810
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,550
needs to specify our kasha flux right

811
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:49,589
operator as a second so so are you going

812
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,780
to discuss it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> delco so because</font>

813
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:53,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely that was my eye when I was</font>

814
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,530
listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I said this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a parrot</font>

815
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,029
issue because it requires the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

816
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:59,730
you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in the signal</font>

817
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,589
needs definitely something that we need

818
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done in hurt because that the</font>

819
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:08,400
signaling is audio issues so so so boss

820
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:11,490
has a draft on RT x which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is similar to</font>

821
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,630
the same kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of considerations as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font>

822
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:15,240
with you they did I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

823
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually talked about faq in it but it</font>

824
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,839
touches on the same problems and I think

825
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:21,330
whatever solution is derived from that

826
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:23,099
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably also be applied to the</font>

827
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:25,049
fact again what would be the conclusion

828
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,690
what which would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have something</font>

829
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:31,170
about these about the issue of when to

830
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:34,260
do the srp peas before after defecting

831
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:36,300
the payload or we leave it to 3 7 11 and

832
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">2 and 2 3rd I mean that's a question</font>

833
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,200
because it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> muggle said that if</font>

834
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,510
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the paper that when you</font>

835
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,669
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but it's not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

836
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">i mean i'm jonathan i mean i think two</font>

837
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,180
magnets this point i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's going to</font>

838
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">be I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

839
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,180
know try to use flex<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack but fall back</font>

840
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,130
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all their stuff you're going to offer</font>

841
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:57,569
flex<font color="#CCCCCC"> ack effect and RG x and you know</font>

842
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,430
you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to</font>

843
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,440
do my effect processing the different

844
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:03,799
place than the code depending on which

845
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,000
payload format i get that would be chaos

846
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,950
but on the flip<font color="#CCCCCC"> side you're saying that</font>

847
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I'm sure which which affect</font>

848
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,640
processing do you do would depend on

849
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,619
what kind of stp you're doing yeah well

850
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,779
let me perfect I mean work obviously

851
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:18,150
behaves a lot differently than<font color="#E5E5E5"> regular</font>

852
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,070
refusing your doing double right so I

853
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,480
mean I'd say that you know when you're

854
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:24,270
negotiating that you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> double</font>

855
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,460
that means that you need to do your

856
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,960
repair flows of it differently and sort

857
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">of inherently because obviously you have</font>

858
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,400
to do it again after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end and whether</font>

859
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,320
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it before after hop-by-hop that's</font>

860
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,520
something perks gonna me to decide so

861
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Collins not here so they can just say</font>

862
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:42,859
put it in double and we'll be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

863
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:44,720
put it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> doubles I think the conclusion</font>

864
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:47,390
is that will have the discussion in perk

865
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,669
and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will help clarify whether</font>

866
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">perk is going to specify something for</font>

867
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and if they do then maybe we can</font>

868
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:54,709
remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from flex back and let Park</font>

869
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,830
specify and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide workers</font>

870
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,900
what weather or what we specify in this

871
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,730
document in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> because because</font>

872
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,950
concrete we don't specify anything I

873
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,290
would assume it stood like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we said yes 7</font>

874
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,960
11 which means you do it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SR</font>

875
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,060
yep so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we say nothing then it would</font>

876
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,030
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same default as well and so in</font>

877
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,369
her clinicals to discuss it compare okay

878
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:20,180
so bits in the embedment come back then

879
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:27,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody interested come tomorrow to</font>

880
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:29,660
park and and discuss it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Terrell Piper</font>

881
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:32,029
again I was just wondering if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font>

882
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:35,899
had I assume this is protected video

883
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:38,090
content delivery and and but not

884
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,160
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a professional you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

885
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,930
not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-value content just</font>

886
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,859
it could be you know privacy you know

887
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:47,270
she's for tomorrow fine I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font>

888
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:50,029
wondering if you've considered and

889
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:52,550
looked at and thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about using crypto</font>

890
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:55,970
on security we designed an ipsec and

891
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:59,330
multicast see see how the old stuff so

892
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:01,700
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we are doing in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTP</font>

893
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:03,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're specifying how there's a salty</font>

894
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,720
kick you in cryptography but we have a

895
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:07,760
document that says you can use other

896
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,348
mechanism if you had like IP sick or

897
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,390
whatever there's a document to discuss

898
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:13,550
this it says what other options are

899
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,920
persecuting the yeah I guess I'm just

900
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:26,390
advocating that that beer route people

901
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:28,730
can go to use IPSec<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

902
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,650
next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> please anything else on the s</font>

903
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:33,619
so the result was we're going to discuss

904
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:36,380
it in fact and we hopefully will be able

905
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:38,000
to remove anything related<font color="#CCCCCC"> SR to be out</font>

906
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:42,589
of this spec and and let em be

907
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,260
documented somewhere else next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so</font>

908
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:47,660
that's it the only other open issue is i

909
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that the protection recovery</font>

910
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,819
procedures need to be clarified a little

911
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,140
bit

912
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,180
some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> could take a read through it</font>

913
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:58,470
and see what's clearing what's not clear

914
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:59,520
to them that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be helpful so</font>

915
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,859
otherwise I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font>

916
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,540
fer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay just to summarize where we</font>

917
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:07,290
stand so they were having when you're

918
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,490
here you're 33 changes that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are it</font>

919
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,529
so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first to do we didn't have</font>

920
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:11,910
any discussion that there except the

921
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:14,250
third one we have to wait to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

922
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:15,990
decision what<font color="#E5E5E5"> after perv which means</font>

923
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,270
that anyhow in order to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work you</font>

924
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:20,910
last call we still need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get those two</font>

925
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:27,080
seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to finalize the third me sugar yep</font>

926
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yep great okay thank you any other</font>

927
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,970
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last presentation for our</font>

928
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:37,950
presentation any other issues I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

929
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:42,140
be stuff together<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so thank you we</font>

930
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:45,750
finished about 15 used yeah okay fella

931
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:49,740
soccer again just a few minutes I will

932
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:52,020
be brief I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce very</font>

933
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,729
briefly what we're doing it check frame

934
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,040
so i don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you are</font>

935
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,660
aware of fact friend she's a protocol

936
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,970
that was specified by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact frame</font>

937
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,560
working group but not in this area in

938
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,419
the transport area which is probably the

939
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,690
reason why we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were not so</font>

940
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:11,550
many exchanges between us so it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

941
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:14,780
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ic 63 well maybe in 2011 and not</font>

942
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:17,430
remember exactly but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong these days</font>

943
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:21,260
since then the working group has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

944
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:25,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">closed so why am today is that we are</font>

945
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:28,170
extending this protocol back 4m protocol

946
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:33,210
towards new types of FEC schemes

947
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:34,980
actually cuts namely congressional codes

948
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:38,490
so that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two interesting things</font>

949
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:41,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think in this work which is by the way</font>

950
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:44,100
joint walkways<font color="#CCCCCC"> alley began first of all</font>

951
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:46,560
a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> actor and if I can discuss</font>

952
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">with some of you what a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difference is</font>

953
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:52,200
the benefits of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a within article</font>

954
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:54,470
below<font color="#E5E5E5"> a typical friends somewhat</font>

955
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,330
shim layer that fits between OTP and

956
00:45:54,470 --> 00:46:00,830
unity then I would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very happy that's</font>

957
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:03,490
the first point and second point is a

958
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,529
deuce

959
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:09,129
schemes that we call congressional

960
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:11,560
schemes<font color="#CCCCCC"> FEC codes they were in totally</font>

961
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:15,190
different way from what we had here with

962
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:17,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">XO codes or records or with lemon curd a</font>

963
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:19,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">lipsy cut all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them this is those are</font>

964
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,680
not block codes there are convolutional

965
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,299
codes which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is a</font>

966
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:26,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">sliding incoming window that will slide</font>

967
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:29,020
over the source flow and whenever you

968
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:31,630
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to produce a repair packet but you</font>

969
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:34,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">just have to create linear combination</font>

970
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:36,400
the sauce packets that are within this

971
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:40,270
and curling window unless it you sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

972
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,520
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally different and we carried</font>

973
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:44,619
out extensive personal simulations and

974
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,560
there is a key benefits in using those

975
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:49,869
cuts in terms of improved robustness and

976
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,480
reduced end-to-end latency in terms of

977
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:54,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">FCA calling in different so if you are</font>

978
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,440
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all there will be a</font>

979
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:02,410
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that presentation</font>

980
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:04,630
in next<font color="#CCCCCC"> gsv meeting which will take</font>

981
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,970
place on Thursday afternoon I think we

982
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:10,869
see the first afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> session</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gsv</font>

983
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:12,730
working group and otherwise i will be

984
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:15,369
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> also to discuss with you to show</font>

985
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:18,060
you more details and Duffman simulation

986
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:20,170
or old stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hello</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

987
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:24,640
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that I can go to this</font>

988
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:27,730
session<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing we forgive</font>

989
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,069
others followed protocol scheme we

990
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:32,740
decided it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

991
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,150
afterwards in a second in the documents

992
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,979
