00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,830
piece of technology coming out of the

41
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,259
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> another thing that's kind of</font>

software's themselves and so we had a

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,210
great discussion of that how how the

49
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,119
different working groups are are doing

50
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,970
that and what

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,440
learn from them and hopefully be able to

52
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,110
