1
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:19,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you mean to turn the whole time I think</font>

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:28,140
we're good I'll take easy choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font>

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:41,879
mess up to do what's right it didn't

4
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:44,519
seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make we're good we were flying</font>

5
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,649
very low and we got in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than equal</font>

6
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:51,929
to clock I'm a gallon a meeting that

7
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,519
went out 1252 so we were deciding free

8
00:00:51,929 --> 00:01:11,070
to the computer chair slides at the

9
00:00:53,519 --> 00:01:14,420
Embassy Oh creepy point so we will be

10
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,419
starting in just a moment or two

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,749
[Music]

12
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:08,709
see this yeah so there are she loves you

13
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:37,299
there's another so let's go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

14
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:43,160
started yeah maybe in about an hour so

15
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:45,109
I'm still Spitzer<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new year and we're</font>

16
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,560
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to start the second tsv</font>

17
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:50,329
area session we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are passing around a new</font>

18
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,640
set of blue sheet so if you were at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

19
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:55,580
last meeting please sign blue sheets

20
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,160
again because that's per meeting

21
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:02,960
um are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we putting up the note well again</font>

22
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,640
yes excellent so we will put<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the note</font>

23
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:10,100
well again so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everybody can note</font>

24
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:19,399
well that thing said here are ITF

25
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:21,260
contributions yeah we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had one session</font>

26
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,950
already and we start in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the into the</font>

27
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:28,219
next sessions we have a presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

28
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tom Herbert and then we have the rest of</font>

29
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,330
the time which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably hopefully</font>

30
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,710
might not use completely on the

31
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,070
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about congressional troll and</font>

32
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,599
how to handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> congestion control</font>

33
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:42,409
algorithms and conditional to work in

34
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:58,070
the IETF but we start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tom where is</font>

35
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:59,690
he they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect hi my name is chrome</font>

36
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:04,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Herbert and I'm going to talk about</font>

37
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:06,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Express data path or xdp a little bit of</font>

38
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,200
background this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a project that we</font>

39
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">started in a Linux networking stack</font>

40
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,930
about a little over a year ago and if

41
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,230
you remember at<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTF</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soil in the open</font>

42
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,240
plenary we had that<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion about the</font>

43
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,350
denial of service attacks and dying and

44
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was X a cloud fire presentation</font>

45
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:29,000
one of the rationales behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> xtp was</font>

46
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,600
precisely for dressing denial of service

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,410
attacks kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and it turns</font>

48
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:40,190
out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare actually presented a</font>

49
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,350
discussion about a year ago on what they

50
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,479
were doing to solve denial of service in

51
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,580
their system and basically they were

52
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,890
going through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty long path and</font>

53
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,020
getting really<font color="#E5E5E5"> miserable numbers so some</font>

54
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,900
of us in the Linux community we started

55
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,060
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the problem and realized we</font>

56
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,739
need a better wife so that's kind of the

57
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">background I'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more into</font>

58
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:04,710
some of the things we're doing with

59
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:06,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">cloudflare a minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Laye so</font>

60
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,479
agenda today so I'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

61
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,260
with history specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> userspace tax</font>

62
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,030
which have kind of been the current

63
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">model</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve a lot of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

64
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:21,270
and then we'll go through the the

65
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:23,490
foundation BPF eb b PF and then present

66
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:28,080
the solution and then how we're looking

67
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:30,330
forward to extend the solution so

68
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually inflamed works the idea behind</font>

69
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,849
these is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a librarian user</font>

70
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,630
space and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application can access the</font>

71
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:41,880
networking directly so in this case

72
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:44,280
packets for instance arrived on a Q and

73
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,159
a user space application or process

74
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,960
processing them directly without any

75
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,330
interference or any processing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

76
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,820
colonel so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like a direct</font>

77
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,490
data path from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

78
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,340
application completely bypasses the

79
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,500
colonel it's safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use people like</font>

80
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and has found a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of niches</font>

81
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:08,550
particularly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-frequency trading</font>

82
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:10,710
and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> hpc realms so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

83
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,600
what why why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ever bother with</font>

84
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,080
this we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel networking stacks</font>

85
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,470
for years<font color="#CCCCCC"> bsd stacks bsd sockets they've</font>

86
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,359
all been kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of developed the nominal</font>

87
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:25,470
reason is usually given as performance

88
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,230
so by having direct access to say

89
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,780
network device from user space we can

90
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:34,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">squeeze out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some performance but some of</font>

91
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,419
the other reasons are safety for

92
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,270
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the isolation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

93
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,890
the system gives you if we crash an

94
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,840
application in user space it doesn't

95
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:47,219
crash the whole system so that's kind of

96
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,549
a nice feature developing developing in

97
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:57,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the kernel is difficult in some sense a</font>

98
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:59,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people are little trepidatious</font>

99
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,670
you look at companies like Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

100
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,680
Facebook they have maybe 20 or 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> curl</font>

101
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,620
engineers and thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thousands of</font>

102
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,950
C++ programmers and Java programmers so

103
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,690
there's a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of weight towards</font>

104
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,340
kind of we know how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff in user</font>

105
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,630
space we get more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more into user</font>

106
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,630
space that's somewhat of a trend we've

107
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,810
been seen and another big one and this

108
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,400
is

109
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,980
is one that that we've known for a while

110
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,049
has a lot to do with upgrades reboots

111
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,850
things like that if we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reboot</font>

112
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the colonel because of problem or read</font>

113
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,860
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system very invasive takes a</font>

114
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,529
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> an upgrade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Colonels what have</font>

115
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so that's kind of a known ongoing</font>

116
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:44,310
problem so on the other hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> user space</font>

117
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,710
tax frameworks they're difficult to use

118
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,569
for general solutions if you look most

119
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,330
of them are usually some niche

120
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,890
applications best example is probably

121
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high frequency traders the guys who</font>

122
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:58,290
want to execute trades in microseconds

123
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,900
they really don't need anything except

124
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,270
access to the stack maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> do UDP or TCP</font>

125
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,660
but it's very dedicated application so

126
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,400
it's a good use case for this for the

127
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,699
general case though implementing say a

128
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,180
full tcp/ip stack and user space very

129
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,540
difficult to make work and cross all

130
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,829
circumstances hybrid path solutions this

131
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,719
is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cloudflare was doing</font>

132
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:25,410
originally they were actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

133
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,830
packets received in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kernel affording</font>

134
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:30,209
them into user space on a raw interface

135
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,770
doing the denial of service mitigation

136
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,860
they're basically filtering out which

137
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,970
packets to say which packets to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fort and</font>

138
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,700
then they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending the package back</font>

139
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,560
into the kernel do more processing

140
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and then actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up to</font>

141
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,800
the application so this kind of

142
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,729
boomerang effect we've seen occasionally

143
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,620
amazingly they<font color="#CCCCCC"> claim this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was better</font>

144
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:53,580
than than implementing something in the

145
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:57,180
kernel using TC classifiers nevertheless

146
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,930
that's what they were doing performance

147
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:04,680
numbers if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the documentation</font>

148
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:07,650
a lot of the documents about user space

149
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,319
tax will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're 10 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> x 100x faster</font>

150
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:13,860
than the kernel and those are little

151
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,290
jaded be careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that user space 2</font>

152
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,610
X will be faster but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not binding so many</font>

153
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:22,469
orders of magnitude but more practically

154
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,910
when we saw em for instance at Facebook

155
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,190
and Google when we consider doing this

156
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,890
if we have to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a separate stack</font>

157
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:31,170
even in user space maintaining two

158
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,170
stacks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same system that's a</font>

159
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of pain</font>

160
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,449
that's one of the kind of big downsides

161
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:40,660
to having<font color="#CCCCCC"> user space backs and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

162
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:43,570
need a kernel stack the other thing is

163
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">user space and kind of implies more</font>

164
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:49,630
proprietary solutions this can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

165
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,730
in some context for for an application

166
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">that needs that but if you think in</font>

167
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,720
terms of a larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> community if we do</font>

168
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,600
have a good solution for denial of

169
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,860
service if one application needs that is

170
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
probably true<font color="#E5E5E5"> that almost all of them</font>

171
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,170
need it so it's good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that kind</font>

172
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,750
of community behind us the other thing

173
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,680
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some extra constraints for</font>

174
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:14,050
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge pages in DP DK these both</font>

175
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,638

176
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,769
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the best performance but they</font>

177
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:23,649
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually hurt in some generalization</font>

178
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:27,010
of the problem so what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really need is</font>

179
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,600
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be programmability of policy in</font>

180
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,370
the kernel and it's actually

181
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,470
programmability everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in networking</font>

182
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you think about it so the trend of</font>

183
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,339
SDN for instance is programmable

184
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,839
networking program own devices

185
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:40,570
programmable in the kernel programmable

186
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,910
from user space so<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything's</font>

187
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,769
programmable in some senses is kind of

188
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,350
the goal and the colonel it's a

189
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:48,910
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue like i mentioned</font>

190
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,670
kernels are typically monolithic hard to

191
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,279
update making it nimble for program

192
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,260
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> t kind of an oxymoron in some</font>

193
00:11:54,279 --> 00:12:04,120
sense with some of the goals of the

194
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:05,920
colonel nextly so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the long long</font>

195
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,390
text of what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need but the short</font>

196
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,779
answer is we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want something that</font>

197
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,670
super programmable super flexible and

198
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,100
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the community so that we can</font>

199
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,959
share our solutions and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of</font>

200
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:24,279
the basis for how we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

201
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:26,469
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex VP Express data path so now we</font>

202
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,300
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in history a little bit and</font>

203
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,910
beginnings of our solution actually go

204
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,269
back to nineteen<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety two at Lawrence</font>

205
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:36,730
Berkeley Lab's van<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jacobson and Stephen</font>

206
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:39,339
McCain kind of were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first to see</font>

207
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:42,190
that we need this programmability inside

208
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:44,860
the colonel needs for one small part so

209
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,640
from this berkeley packet filters was

210
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,050
born

211
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,470
we've known about this for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time</font>

212
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:53,829
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been heavily used in TCP dump</font>

213
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:58,090
packet filtering trace domes things like

214
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,860
that now from the beginning was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

215
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,960
limited was never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really intended at</font>

216
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,110
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> back then to be kind of an open</font>

217
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,430
flexible platform for programmability so

218
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:10,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">was kind of limited in what it could do</font>

219
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:14,829
it had a whole two registers was I think

220
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:17,050
a 16-bit system so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was great I</font>

221
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,150
have a program ability of networking in

222
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,209
the kernel a packet parser that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

223
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,490
effectively open-ended but with the

224
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,840
limitations<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I guess with we needed</font>

225
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,620
to develop the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the coronal the</font>

226
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">rest of networking so for about 24 years</font>

227
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">we didn't see this hidden gem and some</font>

228
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:41,260
in some sense like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast forward 2015</font>

229
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:45,970
and this thing called extended BPF was

230
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:48,640
born<font color="#E5E5E5"> alexys solver 12 now Facebook</font>

231
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,420
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this idea what if we extend</font>

232
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:56,199
BPF added number of registers make it

233
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:59,439
full 64-bit system make a compile easily

234
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:03,820
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> C code directly into whatever</font>

235
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,980
assembly whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytecode we need have</font>

236
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,710
a comprehensive instruction set so we

237
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed to add more than just simple</font>

238
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:16,090
header parsing we want 64-bit operation

239
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:18,220
or 64-bit ops atomic operations data

240
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,710
structures actual real data structures

241
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,730
that we can put ancillary data use those

242
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:27,070
for things like state what have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the</font>

243
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,470
other important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> was since we're</font>

244
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:33,400
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> this code kind of loaded into</font>

245
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:36,130
the kernel we need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> model of safety so</font>

246
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,520
we have this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> called a verifier</font>

247
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:41,050
which prevents code from doing bad

248
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,579
things so for instance we can prevent

249
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:47,199
division by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 or illegal memory accesses</font>

250
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,210
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even though within its</font>

251
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,780
within the colonel so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that</font>

252
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:55,900
this gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> us the same sort of isolation</font>

253
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,760
same sort of guarantees that user space

254
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,300
gives however we're still running

255
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,580
natively in the colonel and

256
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,760
sense with a very thin API so

257
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:08,839
effectively we expect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be almost</font>

258
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:11,330
bare metal inside the colonel so II BPF

259
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,850
ended up being pretty successful and

260
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,980
right now in the linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack this is</font>

261
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,950
used pretty much all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the place the</font>

262
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,570
tracing guys really jumped onto this so

263
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,420
we used to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DTrace</font>

264
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:26,180
estrace these were kind of difficult we

265
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,339
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to be flexible but we also</font>

266
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,349
need it some sort of programmability

267
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:32,360
like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trace specific</font>

268
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,010
events how do i program that so they

269
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,149
jumped on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and now there's a</font>

270
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:41,390
whole kind of sub sub project on making

271
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:44,269
BPF and trayce Thompson logging work

272
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,939
inside the colonel that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even outside</font>

273
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:49,130
networking and one of the side effects

274
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,279
of that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> its became so big that we</font>

275
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:57,439
now hardware support for it and and

276
00:15:52,279 --> 00:16:00,910
heading down<font color="#CCCCCC"> that path next time so the</font>

277
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,019
BPF architecture is pretty elaborate now

278
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,110
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned there's a lot of use</font>

279
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:07,480
cases at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top even outside of</font>

280
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,089
networking so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using these for</font>

281
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,310
analytics<font color="#CCCCCC"> blogging as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned and</font>

282
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:15,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> good news</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is we can write this in</font>

283
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,290
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> languages so the original BPF</font>

284
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:22,370
was pretty much machine code assembly

285
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:25,459
hard to use about about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

286
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:28,550
BPF came out LOL vm added compiler

287
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:30,469
supports now we can write BPF directly

288
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,260
and see so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a huge win for</font>

289
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,200
programmability this goes through

290
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:39,319
various<font color="#E5E5E5"> colonel subsystems we have a JIT</font>

291
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,540
compiler and also back in compilers into

292
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,180
specific platforms and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

293
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:49,520
mentioned BPF is running across various

294
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:52,760
forms of hardware so all of this is

295
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">great it still doesn't really answer the</font>

296
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,380
question of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we do denial service</font>

297
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:00,260
mitigation at line rate millions of

298
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,760
packets per second that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> express</font>

299
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">data path came from or at least the</font>

300
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,309
motivation so about 2016 we started

301
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,329
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the denial service problems</font>

302
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:12,709
in particular also load balancing load

303
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,919
balancers things like that and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font>

304
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,640
up

305
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:21,320
with this concept of xkp the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

306
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:25,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">run a BPF program as low as possible in</font>

307
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:27,109
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kernel basically on the device so</font>

308
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,400
the program is actually sitting the

309
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:31,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">received part of the program sits on</font>

310
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,290
receive cues as packets come in we

311
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually process the raw packet so</font>

312
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,250
there's no concept of metadata and no

313
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,280
concept of going through various layers

314
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,380
of protocol processing we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

315
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,379
basically calling a function a BPF

316
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,330
program saying here's the packet here's

317
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning of it hears the end of it</font>

318
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,159
may be a little bit of ancillary

319
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:55,909
information that we got from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

320
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,540
but that's it BPF program go do whatever

321
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:02,360
you need to do so BPF program takes this

322
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:06,139
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually comes up with a simple</font>

323
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:10,030
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> either drop the packet accept</font>

324
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,030
the packet into the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stack or</font>

325
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:15,740
transmit the packet transmitted the

326
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:17,629
packet usually entails either in popping

327
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,270
or pushing encapsulation headers and

328
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,680
then sending it back<font color="#CCCCCC"> out right now at</font>

329
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,080
the same interface but eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

330
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,410
interface all of this being done

331
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,470
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the raw packet for various</font>

332
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,420
reasons we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to do DMA on maps</font>

333
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:35,350
for instance or in a fancy memory

334
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,240
allocation so very fast we get the speed

335
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,770
BPF gives us the programmability and the

336
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,010
environment gives us kind of that safe

337
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,900
context that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was talking about before</font>

338
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:47,710
so the important thing is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> xdp data</font>

339
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:50,060
path even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's in the kernel</font>

340
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:55,430
works in harmony with the colonel it's

341
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:57,919
still kind of programmable it's like so

342
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,140
from this we kind of derive the xdp

343
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,450
packet processor and pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

344
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:06,020
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said so at the bottom we have the</font>

345
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:10,490
various input<font color="#E5E5E5"> queues for my device they</font>

346
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:12,139
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the BPF program and the vpf</font>

347
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,930
program district turns drop in which

348
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,600
case we just discard the packet not a

349
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,610
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to do there forward is</font>

350
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,350
rewriting the packet prep maybe an

351
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,510
address and then sending it back out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

352
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,389
same interface and then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

353
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the receive stack gr 0 is</font>

354
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,560
one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still have to do</font>

355
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,780
that's a way to Cole<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask packets of a</font>

356
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,659
single TCP connection into a larger

357
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:39,440
packet for the advantages of processing

358
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:41,720
larger packets in the set and then those

359
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,690
packets can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go up and then if we receive</font>

360
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,740
the packet it just becomes a normal

361
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,960
packing in the kernel we just do the

362
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,360
normal processing so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance if we</font>

363
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,670
were doing denial service mitigation we

364
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,229
could do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigation at the lower</font>

365
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,300
layer and if the packet exhale

366
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,770
acceptable we just send it right into

367
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:04,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stack if it's not accept the wall</font>

368
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:06,740
gets dropped I think so<font color="#E5E5E5"> xep has a few</font>

369
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:11,300
important properties so one is it is

370
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed for high performance so there's</font>

371
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,200
a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of techniques that we know</font>

372
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,419
about user space tax have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

373
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,400
these and we can put these same sort of

374
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:23,090
techniques inside the colonel on next EP

375
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:26,180
spin polling optimizing cache misses

376
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:28,399
with catch prefetch four or five other

377
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,100
things all of this is locked less and we

378
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,030
never get into atomic operations in this

379
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:37,250
path as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned its design</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

380
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:39,649
programmability so we can add new

381
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,560
functionality into the kernel without

382
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:45,080
changing the colonel without a reboot

383
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:48,200
everything can now be done on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly it</font>

384
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,060
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colonel bypass in the sense that</font>

385
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,250
it's integrating to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> colonel and we</font>

386

<font color="#E5E5E5">Colonel data structures this will become</font>

388
00:20:54,140 --> 00:21:00,170
really important for instance if we want

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,630
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do statesville tcp and we actually</font>

390
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,090
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see does the current local stack</font>

391
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,430
actually have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp state so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

392
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:10,250
access that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp state from the BPF</font>

393
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:13,520
program to determine if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a state</font>

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:16,400
associated with it it does not replace

395
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,060
the tcp/ip stack this right now is a

396
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,890
layer below it we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some ideas for</font>

397
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,570
kind of introducing some of these

00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,620
features<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a higher layer layer to get</font>

399
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:29,179
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the benefits but for now its</font>

400
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,610
programs running at the lower layer

401
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,620
there are some other BPF programs that

402
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:37,189
run in concert with sockets and some of

403
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:39,379
the other aspects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp so this is kind</font>

407
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,629
low level this is in a sense below the

408
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:50,960
stack kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a preprocessor for the</font>

409
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:53,420
stack and then the last one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

410
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">important so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> xdp does not require any</font>

run<font color="#CCCCCC"> xtp on pretty much any device and</font>

417
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,180
we don't need ritual functions or any of

that stuff now advanced features we do

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interoperate with and use those</font>

420
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:26,330
however fundamentally this is something

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,490
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe can sup we can solve problems</font>

service mitigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> the easiest one is</font>

429
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,920
just have a sort of black list of bad

430
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,909
IPS and can filter on those very simple

431
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,080

00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,879
able to build a device kind of doing

getting performance numbers to improve

473
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,980
overall in the system if we allow 24

for certain attacks that are obviously

like a temple with hack would be on one

485
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:22,970

you so they can download the BPF program

and we can run that in hardware let's

501

created is about the role of congestion

576
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,620
control and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecology and how this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

577
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,020
stuff fits together in the ITF it's

578
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,530
really you know why was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see zhe</font>

579
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,300
created why does it exist it was created

580
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,800
at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there were all</font>

581
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,700
these proposals on new congestion

582
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:54,280
controls cubic HTTP compound TCP at that

583
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,470
time they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought to tcp M&T CPM</font>

584
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,668
was busy and they needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place where</font>

585
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,679
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people could go and discuss</font>

586
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:03,529
and maybe give up<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully give up</font>

587
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,999
right or maybe continue and then then at

588
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:07,940
some point come back and then they've

589
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:09,379
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre evaluated and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm here to tell</font>

590
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:13,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">you that this is a good procedure and</font>

591
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:16,248
it's been actually working so yeah the

592
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">phrase we need propose propose a place</font>

593
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:19,639
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can push proposals over the</font>

594
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,679
fence and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they can bake there until</font>

595
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:25,428
they're ready and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then this is how we do</font>

596
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,919
it so that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're with a happy</font>

597
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:31,340
trashcan of the idea we got stuff you

598
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:36,499
know it bakes there and now yeah it's

599
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:38,269
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's a very important</font>

600
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:40,489
aspect to this animation before anything

601
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:43,299
else happens there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing else there</font>

602
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:47,019
right but ii CPM is already grumpy

603
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:52,129
because that's that's how they operate

604
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:54,649
so this was ITF 75 2009<font color="#CCCCCC"> mr. junkie they</font>

605
00:30:52,129 --> 00:30:57,139
always are right but this is about about

606
00:30:54,649 --> 00:31:00,258
a historic procedure we have a proposal

607
00:30:57,139 --> 00:31:02,809
coming in in rainbow colors it's a

608
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">double u-turn I was proposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to TC p.m.</font>

609
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:10,600
at this ITF and off it went and then

610
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:23,658
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens you know I mean you</font>

611
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:29,989
spend time this is your G and it came

612
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:31,850
back anyway and then they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy and</font>

613
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:33,799
that's pretty much how we operate you

614
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:36,678
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring stuff to us we you know</font>

615
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:38,418
it spent some time in trash and up

616
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:43,309
afterwards it's beautiful and shiny and

617
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:45,320
everything and so in this case it took

618
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:47,690
only three I mean that's maybe a

619
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,418
positive aspect it only took three<font color="#CCCCCC"> idf's</font>

620
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,009
or had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come back and then put some</font>

621
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:55,789
more time in TC p.m. and then it was an

622
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:57,859
experimental RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OG also can publish</font>

623
00:31:55,789 --> 00:32:00,440
documents that's you know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

624
00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:02,299
people don't seem to be aware of that's

625
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRT attract other groups are</font>

626
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:06,320
publishing a lot they can be

627
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:08,690
informational experimental we have only

628
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,428
to congestion<font color="#CCCCCC"> control in the RFC series</font>

629
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,500
and open research issues in congestion

630
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:14,930
control kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of survey stuff</font>

631
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,970
why don't we have any specs of any

632
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">experimental things only because people</font>

633
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,810
don't seem to care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or don't</font>

634
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:23,629
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it really is an open question</font>

635
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:25,280
I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people kind of now I've</font>

636
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:27,260
been proposing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actively to people</font>

637
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,639
they were like all oh IC AG publication

638
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd rather go in the corner and shoot</font>

639
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,530
myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I don't know why that is but</font>

640
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:39,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">it seems to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really don't want to do</font>

641
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:41,660
that so one of the questions you know

642
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,000
that was that was asked I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

643
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,100
address here is it necessary that I

644
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,190
teeth congestion control work is spread

645
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,179
around the ITF the way it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

646
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,710
personally think this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

647
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,930
inevitable thing because congestion

648
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,330
control as a function is intrinsically

649
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:59,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">tied to the goals that the protocol is</font>

650
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:02,000
trying to solve if you think of MPG cpe

651
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,280
your arm<font color="#CCCCCC"> participe congestions all is</font>

652
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,570
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear on what kinds of</font>

653
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,910
goals it has and what is trying to

654
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:11,990
achieve which is very different from say

655
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:13,760
that bed or from say<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp well not so</font>

656
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,180
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> from tcp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but from our</font>

657
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,650
mcat for instance but has a goal of

<font color="#E5E5E5">being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> delayed based yet into operating</font>

660
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,130
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll conclude by saying you're happy</font>

661
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:37,429
trash can is always here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to serve you</font>

there's a does we just to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

669
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,030
getting a draft out of that at some

670
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,670
point there is going to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question of</font>

671
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:09,080
where should it land and the in mind

672
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,850
that we know how a quick working group

673
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,100
that actually has conditioned controller

674
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,659
also as a part of it so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

675
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,190
that is a real question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where should</font>

676
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,950
all of this condition control activity

677
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:21,409
lie should be even in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> retrospect now</font>

678
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:22,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know maybe take cubic and say well</font>

679
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,760
you should you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> write it in such a</font>

680
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,970
way that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also applies to do</font>

681
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:33,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">PCB maybe we should have a cubic TCB and</font>

682
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:35,480
a cubic a quick draft I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

683
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:37,370
if you're describing it without framing

684
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,889
it certainly seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> belong in a place</font>

685
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:42,799
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not specific to a protocol let</font>

686
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:44,360
bed was a perfect example of this but

687
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,889
going forward I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

688
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,480
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write condition control</font>

689
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:49,639
documents are there separable from the

690
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,280
protocol itself and maybe also having

691
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways to express how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

692
00:34:51,280 --> 00:35:02,480
specifically exemplified in those

693
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:04,820
protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so the IETF a long</font>

694
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,580
time ago bought this Dogma TCP friend

695
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:10,100
body which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course an oxymoron</font>

696
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:13,400
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about TCP at all it's</font>

697
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:15,080
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reno we've reached the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:21,230
replace those words by not relevant in

701
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:27,460
really belongs in this working group

702
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:30,170
this this research group is if you

703
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,690
disband the words TCP friendly what do

704
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,880
you replace them with how do you say

705
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,760
freedom from congestion collapse how do

706
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,410
you say reasonable behavior under

707
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,020
resource exhaustion how do there's a

708
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:44,930
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that TCP friendly</font>

709
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:47,560
embodies the TCP friendly hit has no

710
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:50,930
longer no longer functions to provide

711
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,450
and we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to replace the TCP</font>

712
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:56,620
friendly dog I guess some other safety

713
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:59,540
consideration I guess the probably most

714
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:02,270
accepted definition that we have is in

715
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,550

but the end devices have no visibility

798
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,370
about this so they cannot for example

799
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,710
assume that a given<font color="#CCCCCC"> network has a km or</font>

not there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no way to detect that so</font>

801
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:55,480
the operating system implementation has

802
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:59,680
to kind of account for the case where

there is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> a qm quick is coming up</font>

804
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,460
there might be cases now we're popular

805
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,800
mobile applications write their own

806
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,770
transport so things are getting to a

807
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,510
stage where there's not just one or two

00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:20,250
it becomes very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

812
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:24,280
reason about performance or you know how

the network would behave the other

814
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:30,550
interesting case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the public</font>

running different<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating systems so</font>

817
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:35,350
kind of doing different forms of

818
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:42,430
condition control on the same bottleneck

819
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:44,799
links so buffer bloat is real this is

820
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,799
like smooth dirty<font color="#CCCCCC"> D information from</font>

823
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,890
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to imply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that correlations</font>

links causation here but it does look

825
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:03,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">like on in peak load times the rtd is</font>

826
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,589
inflating a lot and this impacts

827
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,800
everything from like page load times to

828
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,170
us

829
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,610
awesomeness in games so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font>

830
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:17,400
problem we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing this data right</font>

831
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:19,630
now so so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of</font>

832
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:26,920
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I wanted this room to</font>

833
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:28,000
kind of chime in on and debate so yes a

834
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,370
multitude of congestion control

835
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,410
algorithms so how do implementers deal

836
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:36,490
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this situation do we test the</font>

837
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:37,930
entire kind of matrix here of every

838
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:40,600
condition control working with another

839
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:43,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">condition control as well as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> QM this</font>

840
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,860
matrix is kind of blowing up so as an

841
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,690
implement of my question is what would

842
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:50,590
be what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the best way to kind of</font>

843
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:52,090
address that that problem the other

844
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,610
question I have is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we prevent</font>

845
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:57,250
this from becoming an arms race for

846
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:58,660
example when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run tests with cubic and</font>

847
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,810
compound sharing the same bottleneck

848
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,609
link cubic just kills compound and then

849
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,350
it would create a perception problem

850
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:08,050
because people are running speed tests

851
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:09,730
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for example windows's you</font>

852
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:12,160
know slower than<font color="#CCCCCC"> android for example</font>

853
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is how do we kind</font>

854
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,899
of prevent this from everybody trying to

855
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">go as fast as they can and kind of</font>

856
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:25,150
causing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Buffalo to become worse over</font>

857
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:27,970
time I think Matt was talking about TCP

00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:29,500
friendly so yeah I have the quiz

859
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:32,259
question now what does differently

860
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,880
actually mean bbr is also complicating

861
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,150
things a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's heuristic</font>

862
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,250
based so now you know in presence of bbr

863
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:44,370
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> define things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT</font>

864
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:47,950
friendliness late comer fairness and

865
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:50,049
yeah the final question is what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

866
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this is just publishing a set of</font>

867
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:54,730
informational RFC is good enough because

868
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,860
as an implementer I feel it's not good

869
00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:02,470
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like there is</font>

870
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:04,750
not enough clear guidance on how to we

871
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:08,919
kind of deal with this situation today

872
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:13,330
in today's networks so yeah I would

873
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:15,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">request people to like could you expand</font>

874
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:18,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little bit more on your last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

875
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're as an implementer you feel that</font>

876
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,040
information

877
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,950
these aren't giving enough guidance what

878
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:29,950
would be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful or what do you feel</font>

879
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:32,859
is lacking ah my question would be how

880
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:34,509
do we kind of define what it means to

881
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:39,310
coexist<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other condition at all</font>

882
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:42,940
algorithms and again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

883
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:45,520
friendliness question remains so do does

884
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,020
every RFC have to go out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

885
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,460
into account every popular condition

886
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,130
control algorithm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> list how it is</font>

887
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,570
friendly with it how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we define</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rtd</font>

888
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:59,410
fairness and late comer fairness<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

889
00:43:52,570 --> 00:44:01,360
of that ok so my other comment is really

890
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:03,549
addressed a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more towards</font>

evaluating whether congestion control

903

was safe how to fairly compare different

904
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:47,560
different algorithms because we were

905
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:50,140
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were working group meetings where</font>

906

unable to to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> through that said well</font>

922
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:34,509

the implementers and operators and

can speak to the research community and

00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:52,990
say how how we prioritize or how we

931

think things should be evaluated for for

safety or desirability and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that</font>

recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> be given the IETF a</font>

999
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:47,169
little bit more up to date that's my

1000
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">question huh Laura Secord so um Michael</font>

1001
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">said a bunch of the Oscars it so this</font>

1002
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,810
slide could have been from<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years ago</font>

1003
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:58,150
um because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact same questions</font>

1004
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:01,359
we asked ourselves when we had Hamilton

1005
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:03,430
TCP and cubic and and compound right um

1006
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,770
and back then we had Sally is still

1007
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:07,118
around an active and she basically said

1008
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,440
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do this evaluation sweet</font>

1009
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,600
and there's a paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it and then</font>

1010
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,600
somebody turned into into<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to code</font>

1011
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that sweetest is very boring right</font>

1012
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,940
it's basically just a bunch of scenarios

1013
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:20,619
and the idea was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um four th EF but</font>

1014
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,410
also for the academic research community

1015
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:25,300
if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper didn't run through at</font>

1016
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,500
least these scenarios and shoulders the

1017
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,119
plots but<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they were really really</font>

1018
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,220
prescriptive that you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1019
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:32,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">parameter this is the metric here's the</font>

1020
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">range plot this for your thing and</font>

1021
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,250
compare<font color="#E5E5E5"> it against the others you know</font>

1022
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,589
we you would be automatically rejected

1023
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,900
or you wouldn't get face time at the ITF

1024
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:44,650
so the idea was really to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font>

1025
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:46,690
this sort of arm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how would you</font>

1026
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:50,590
call this today I don't know test cases

1027
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:53,109
or something um it's very boring work

1028
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:55,240
right so thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for kicking David to do</font>

1029
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:57,369
this but that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one way forward</font>

1030
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,140
and and today right this better tooling

1031
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:03,160
we probably wouldn't do this

1032
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:06,819
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore i hope arm so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one</font>

1033
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,410
way forward um if we believe but then

1034
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,780
you need to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding to it right and</font>

1035
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:13,299
and it's it's at best it's something I

1036
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:15,460
mean I think it's like looking at the

1037
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,620
years I will change an unfeasibly way

1038
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,570
for well under because I we didn't be

1039
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:22,150
never got you know enough volunteer

1040
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:25,450
cycles yeah the other problem with it

1041
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:26,980
really is that um it as networks get

1042
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:29,649
faster right in this one data center

1043
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,570
stuff earlier right um forget it right

1044
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:33,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">did the the hardware effects are so</font>

1045
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:36,400
overriding that you can take you an

1046
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:38,350
extra stimulation and you know throw it

1047
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,260
away and and for the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center case we</font>

1048
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:42,759
really don't have any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1049
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:45,280
large-scale anything other than running

1050
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:48,190
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data center and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

1051
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting even harder to compare um that</font>

1052
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:52,780
the one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since I'm rambling</font>

1053
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,760
here the one thing I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is going</font>

1054
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,520
to be interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gee that</font>

1055
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:00,730
isn't all sort of gloom and doom is that

1056
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,770
it's quick right because it has um a

1057
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:05,440
whole new set of information about the

1058
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:07,180
path that is better quote unquote and

1059
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,370
what you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> with TCP and so there's a</font>

1060
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:11,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of new meat for congestion control</font>

1061
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,900
researchers to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with and come</font>

1062
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,940
up with new schemes that are actually

1063
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:18,340
you know improving things compared to

1064
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,890
what you can do with TCP so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

1065
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:23,490
that's my hope for for where we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

1066
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:25,390
of research will happen in the future um

1067
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,589
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something that's</font>

1068
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:29,140
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won't happen in the quick</font>

1069
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:39,250
working group I hope no it won't have an

1070
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:41,549
immigrant working history tomorrow I'd

1071
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:46,540
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a comment on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that huffines</font>

1072
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:49,450
slide there is that when you design new

1073
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:51,640
congestion control algorithm you want to

1074
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:53,799
basically provide the best use of the

1075
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,950
network so you you want to do something

1076
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:59,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">like was only be ours basically I aim</font>

1077
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:01,600
for being very conservative<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how you</font>

1078
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:04,630
use the resource and generally be nice

1079
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,490
and the point was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't was</font>

1080
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:08,290
mentioned in the video talk this morning

1081
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:11,140
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are times where you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1082
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:12,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">competing with algorithms that are not</font>

1083
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:15,790
nice at all

1084
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:18,070
and that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like pigs and we'll</font>

1085
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:21,310
just consume all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resources you give</font>

1086
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:23,430
them an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1087
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:27,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">status that means that the nice guys</font>

1088
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:29,319
cannot get in the network because it

1089
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,830
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be known that the refacing pigs and</font>

1090
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,839
when they face the pigs they<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose and</font>

1091
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:37,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that you end up having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1092
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:44,380
design your software as having two modes

1093
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:46,300
it will are the nice mode and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1094
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:48,130
detection cut tells you that you have

1095
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:56,290
the pig on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network you have to pick</font>

1096
00:52:48,130 --> 00:53:00,609
mode also called a cubic or whatever you

1097
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:02,859
call it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

1098
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:05,348
with that is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to</font>

1099
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:07,869
design something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but is not</font>

1100
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:12,820
easy is how you get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pig mud</font>

1101
00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:15,609
when the pig is gone and and we we don't

1102
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:17,950
see that as part of the actual test

1103
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:19,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases that we have today because we</font>

1104
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:27,879
don't recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people have put</font>

1105
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:33,520
pigs on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network ya know that the way</font>

1106
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:40,690
I look at it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no yeah but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are not</font>

1107
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:44,830
always there so you black with no TV no

1108
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">II ok yeah yeah so as I am by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point is</font>

1109
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:48,549
that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have recognized</font>

1110
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:51,490
this idea that the state of the network

1111
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:52,720
is finally if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want evolution we will</font>

1112
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:55,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to recognize that we have the nice</font>

1113
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,430
modern the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mud and the pig mud is</font>

1114
00:53:55,330 --> 00:54:02,080
when you're competing with cubic and you

1115
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:03,819
to be a speaker Sarah that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes I</font>

1116
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,520
mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a real problem today when</font>

1117
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:08,560
like for example a lead bat or compound

1118
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:12,250
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same link with cubic this is a</font>

1119
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:14,830
real problem because being nice when the

1120
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:16,990
network just doesn't work yeah why be

1121
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:20,560
nice to tcby be friendly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font>

1122
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:24,299
when it won't return the favor escorting

1123
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:27,610
Andrew<font color="#E5E5E5"> McGregor from Rome cat</font>

1124
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:29,110
yet so there's one of the things that

1125
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:31,630
caused me to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> worrying about the</font>

1126
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:33,640
stuff is realizing that in the server a

1127
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:36,280
large fraction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the big commercial</font>

1128
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:40,120
cases where the money is in the internet

1129
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:43,480
today the the issue is boils down to all

1130
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:46,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things about fairness and a qm and</font>

1131
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,490
and diffserv and all the stuff it boils

1132
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:51,550
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to which of your customers do you</font>

1133
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:53,770
want not to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to run HD TV during</font>

1134
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:55,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">primetime and if you build enough</font>

1135
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:59,230
capacity where all the customers can get

1136

at a few megabits per second which are

behavior under local overload and all of

1150
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,930
the rest of the stuff just doesn't

important at today's Internet scale what

1153
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,220
is important is the fact that the

1154

<font color="#E5E5E5">research community and a large number of</font>

00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:44,140
other people are still solving

1163
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:02,080
whether or not a protocol is safe i

1164
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:04,270
recently read in a paper a comment that

1165
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,620
said oh well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp so so we</font>

1166
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,570
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have don't have to worry</font>

1167
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,490
about congestion collapse no it's

1168
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:11,920
trivial to write applications that will

1169
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:13,120
cause congestion collapse unfortunately

1170
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,530
you can cause congestion collapse with

1171
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:19,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS so it is a complicated problem it is</font>

1172
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:23,470
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very complicated problem of defining</font>

1173
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:26,700
what is a safe protocol and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1174
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:26,700
the problem that we care about

1175
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:37,759
Nick 11 I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add on on the test</font>

1176
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:40,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">sweet stuff so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason</font>

1177
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,720
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why I didn't proceed</font>

1178
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,700
further is because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not</font>

1179
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,129
that easy I mean might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> boring but</font>

1180
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:48,680
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that easy I try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implement it</font>

1181
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:50,450
and the recommendation there because the

1182
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,250
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it as realistic as</font>

1183
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,569
possible is to use like traffic traces

1184
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,010
try purchase has<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have a lot of</font>

1185
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,510
short flows and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that congestion control</font>

1186
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:58,550
doesn't do anything but short flows it's

1187
00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:00,650
mostly slow start so when I was

1188
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:02,720
implementing it I didn't see I couldn't

1189
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,520
say anything about it basically and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

1190
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,490
I came up with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> own test cases for my</font>

1191
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:10,490
own stuff so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not that easy</font>

1192
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:12,729
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not clear what to do there and the</font>

1193
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:15,859
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to point out in this</font>

1194
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:18,170
area is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's also RM kit which</font>

1195
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:20,630
has some test cases as well and I think

1196
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:24,860
they took a different approach they took

1197
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:29,210
more simple artificial test cases but

1198
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:31,550
here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was also not to say not to</font>

1199
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:34,370
evaluate a congestion control it was

1200
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:37,040
more like if you test those tests then

1201
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:38,900
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be safe enough to do further</font>

1202
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,940
testing on the internet and you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1203
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,580
safe enough for an experimental RFC and

1204
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:45,380
then if we see large-scale deployment we

1205
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:48,799
can move this to Information Center

1206
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,450
trick whatever at some point say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1207
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,660
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach there to allow more</font>

1208
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:55,580
experimentation and to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear that</font>

1209
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:57,470
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an experiment that you shouldn't</font>

1210
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:59,029
like load all your traffic with the

1211
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff you should really try it out and</font>

1212
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:04,580
see what's happening sorry are you

1213
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,290
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should have it we should have</font>

1214
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:08,779
another test suite but a simpler one

1215
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:11,360
that's molecular I'm cat 140 CP very

1216
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:14,840
unjust WC what I'm saying is we should

1217
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:17,510
probably use the status experimental<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1218
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:20,240
do experiments we're sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> showed you</font>

1219
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:22,880
as well the the RFC status experimental

1220
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,680
to do experiments<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah and make</font>

1221
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,360
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everything thats documented as</font>

1222
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,250
experimental is an experiment and not a

1223
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:34,700
recommendation from the IETF to use it

1224
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">for all your traffic or whatever have</font>

1225
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:40,399
heavy RC categories actually mean what

1226
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:42,500
they say David black speaking more I

1227
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,790
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an individual than a working</font>

might be formats comma ballot Matt be

1230
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,810
the judge be the judge of that he used

1231
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:54,100
the word safe and I think he was using

1232
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:56,720
it in the context of congestion control

1233
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:59,299
algorithms not doing damage to each

1234

other I seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been spending all</font>

1235
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:04,970
my time in a space<font color="#CCCCCC"> where safe means</font>

1236
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:08,180
traffic that is not congestion control

1237
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:11,480
it's not going to implement cubic or or

1238
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:14,240
compound or whatever have you what are

1239
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,310
the minimum guardrails that happy put in

1240
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,879
that traffic so it doesn't damage the

1241
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:21,080
stuff that is congestion controlled

1242
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,760
you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this turning up in a number</font>

1247
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,960
question deserves some attention because

1248
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,600
much is we're going to work on much as

1249
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:42,230
we will work on interesting congestion

1250
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:44,720
control algorithms in transport area as

1251
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:46,580
all very good and important the some

1252
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:49,189
chocolates IETF is looking for some

1253
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:58,370
simple rules to not to not screw things

1254
00:59:49,190 --> 01:00:00,470
up generally and<font color="#E5E5E5"> God I was gonna say</font>

1255
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:03,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else but I'm gonna piggyback</font>

1256
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:05,660
on what David just said which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1257
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:09,410
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one reason why</font>

1258
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:11,690
Reno's pogo stick around for for quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1259
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:16,089
while it's incredibly easy to implement

1260
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:18,230
it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get wrong and it works</font>

1261
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:19,910
that's a pretty good reason I mean I

1262
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:21,620
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that having having</font>

1263
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:23,870
something that's as simple as Reno to

1264
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:26,359
recommend knowing fully well that

1265
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,620
anybody who's building our transport

1266
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,480
protocol is going to experiment the

1267
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:32,839
congestion control because there are no

1268
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,430
interrupt problems as such is I think of

1269
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,500
a healthy place that's where we have

1270
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:38,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">been for quite a while this is the</font>

1271
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason that we have PBR this is the</font>

1272
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:44,870
reason we have compound or CT CT and I

1273
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:46,910
think that's not a bad place to be have

1274
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:49,040
one basic requirement and then have a

1275
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:50,720
bunch of things of course I understand

1276
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:54,230
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hard problem how do you</font>

1277
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:56,890
specify how they coexist<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't have</font>

1279
01:00:56,890 --> 01:01:00,430
I remember seeing this is quite a while

1280
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:02,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago too and it's it's hard it's</font>

1281
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:06,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely hard problem the test sweet</font>

1282
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:08,380
thing I don't think scales we can have

1283
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:10,150
we can we can come up with a test feedin

1284
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll tell you now you start working on</font>

1286
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:15,070
in over three years from now and at that

01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">point it's already going to not be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you solve this problem I don't think</font>

1294
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,970

1296
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:45,669

1297
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:48,129
who from security context invent

1298
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:49,900
cryptographic algorithms you get them in

1299
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:52,060
but you obviously don't want all of

1300
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:54,580
those because more agarose mean more

1301
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:56,650
problems let alone the analysis of those

1302
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:57,940
nobody has time to analyze all sorts of

1303
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:59,590
crap that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with because</font>

1304
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:02,560
the analysis takes much so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1305
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:04,570
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> than crafting something on your own</font>

1306
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:07,060
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have that sort of almost like a</font>

1309
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:16,359
things so you try to be come up with a

1310
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:18,340
way in a sense of you want to say no but

1311
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,050
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say no in a friendly way by</font>

1312
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:22,330
saying oh you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first to these</font>

set of tests which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Turner turns out to</font>

1314
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:26,080

1315
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:30,730
those deaths in practice however the

1316
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:33,970
impression I get is you have to be a

1317
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">really big player to actually really get</font>

1318
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:39,790
something adopted because those players

1319
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:42,100
then also go ahead and deploy their

1320
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:43,870
stuff right away and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you after</font>

1321
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:46,779
few years we deployed it and it works

1322
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:48,580
pretty well um and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they</font>

1323
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:50,410
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work done this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

1324
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:52,279
happening in congestion control and

1325
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:54,540
certainly not

1326
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,980
never never seen that so it was a little

1327
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:59,520
bit as theoretical reading in between

1328
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:01,800
the line yeah so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a it's a</font>

1329
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:12,450
little artificial discussion it appears

1330
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:14,040
to me so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i speak</font>

1331
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a test to check on this is it's</font>

1332
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,779
actually trivial to write an application

1333
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:21,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> causes congestion collapse you have</font>

1334
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:24,900
a loop with a that does a fork and then

1335
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:26,250
the child launches a query and you put

1336
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,110
asleep in the outer loop or something

1337
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:30,210
like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's behaves very nicely</font>

1338
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,800
under note normal load but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font>

1339
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:34,380
get into the state where the query takes

1340
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,850
longer than the sleep you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get cascading</font>

1341
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:38,990
you get compounding load you get

1342
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:41,490
regenerative load and its regenerative

1343
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:44,850
anything that causes regenerative load

1344
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:46,560
causes can there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> some part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1345
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:50,100
state space where it has congestive

1346
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:52,440
collapse and and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is actually</font>

1347
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:54,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns does it because it's</font>

1348
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:57,060
it's basically stateless and it's got a

1349
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,500
two second timer and if you're in a

1350
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:00,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation where for instance a root</font>

1351
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,270
server becomes more than two seconds

1352
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:06,330
away everybody's got two queries in the

1353
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:07,410
pipe and the presented load doubles so

1354
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:09,660
the consequence of running<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

1355
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:11,549
capacity is it latches up and at fifty

1356
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:13,170
percent loss rate and it does not

1357
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:16,620
recover until the load goes down to

1358
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:19,830
below half of the bottleneck rate this

1359
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:21,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a mess it's not really fixable in DNS</font>

1360
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:23,340
cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS doesn't have enough stability</font>

1361
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:25,410
but it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy to write</font>

1362
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:29,430
perfectly ordinary sounding applications

1363
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:30,990
that take a very conservative TCP

1364
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:36,419
implementations and still cause

1365
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:37,740
congestion collapse and these really

1366
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:41,580
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> viewed as transport issues</font>

1367
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:43,080
because its transport dynamics do you

1368
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:49,650
have a proposal what we should do it

1369
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:53,069
buddy well the research question is is

1370
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:55,710
how could you imagine creating a test

1371
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:57,870
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> a test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suite to look for</font>

1372
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:59,820
regenerative load there's two different

1373
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">things one is is if the presented load</font>

1374
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:04,170
rises as the performance goes down and

1375
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,999
the other is if the overhead rises as a

1376
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:09,779
performance goes as your

1377
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:11,308
as load goes up and I think of these as

1378
01:05:09,779 --> 01:05:13,919
being measurement based things because

1379
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:15,709
it's they often very small details in

1380
01:05:13,919 --> 01:05:22,999
the state machines cause these problems

1381
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:25,288
I don't know if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a bound</font>

1382
01:05:22,999 --> 01:05:27,448
problem it made me that once we see the

1383
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:28,619
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Italy oh we're at an RFC about it</font>

1384
01:05:27,449 --> 01:05:31,199
here's a test that everything should be

1385
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:36,839
subjected to and that test would replace

1386
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:38,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP friendly language it it may be</font>

1387
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:40,558
that there's always going to be new ways

1388
01:05:38,669 --> 01:05:46,949
in which you can find creative ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1402
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:46,060
through the years to write documents

about sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of general advice and they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we have the UDP guidance document which</font>

1406

at all I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> admit it I don't</font>

1409
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:10,660
remember what it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just updated</font>

1410
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:14,980
yet and that document might say too much

01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:16,990
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it's so even so I mean</font>

1412
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:18,160
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the point about using</font>

1413
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:20,020
congestion control is to avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1414
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,870
congestion columns just by having a

1415
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:24,759
adaptive congestion control the ideas

1416
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:27,339
that if you see increasing load you

1417
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:29,020
would use reduce your load right but if

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you combine this with other</font>

1419
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,840
mechanisms or you have implementation

1420
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:36,520
errors or whatever there's still

1421
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:38,650
something can go wrong um last I guess

1422
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,330
so I'm one of the authors and I think I

1423
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:42,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak for all of the office I say if you</font>

1424
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:46,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">make us open that thing up again we</font>

1425
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:48,970
could but so what it what it says for

1426
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:50,710
UDP actually I think captures even met

1427
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:54,790
is with overload right it basically says

1428
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:58,630
that you should keep an RTT sample if

1429
01:07:54,790 --> 01:08:00,930
you can and then if you you know keep

1430
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:03,010
keep it at most one message<font color="#E5E5E5"> outstanding</font>

1431
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:04,450
unless you want to do something more

1432
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:06,220
complicated like<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually</font>

1433
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:08,230
regression control algorithm but it also

1434
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:09,399
has a default timer when you can't and I

1435
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:11,290
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like three seconds because</font>

1436
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:14,170
that's what TCP uses for the centenary

1437
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:17,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">transmit um but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not only it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1439
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:21,340
are they already sort of and then the

1440
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:22,779
UDP guidelines i think it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1441
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:25,750
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning at that many of those</font>

1442
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:28,389
are thoughts apply to any packet based

1443
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:30,939
thing right not really UDP specifically

1444
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:32,770
but we didn't want to boil an<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

1445
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:36,870
larger ocean and then we are already

01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:36,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">boiling with this document</font>

spheres that will head your direction

1452
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:05,990
see seriously it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bcp it captures</font>

1453
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:08,030
the best current practice as we

understand the state of the state of

previous thread about cubic itself cubic

1463
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:43,370
is is well it's it certainly qualifies

1464
01:09:41,029 --> 01:09:44,689
as BCD not necessary as standard but I

1465
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:45,649
don't want to call it best so maybe you

1466
01:09:44,689 --> 01:09:49,700
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> categorization</font>

1467
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:53,569
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> mcp most current practice or</font>

1468
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:55,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that deployed current</font>

1469
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:56,780
practice there we go one of those

1470
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:58,820
classifications would be quite useful I

1471
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">think for us as the ID calls we've</font>

1472
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:02,000
struggled with this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while say just</font>

1473
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:04,400
because it's deployed we are not going

1474
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,740
to sound eyes it sure but let's talk

1475
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">human</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tit in some form because that's</font>

1476
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,769
what cubic the cubic document is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1477
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,799
not agreeing that it's the best thing on

1478
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:14,330
the planet we are saying it's deployed

1479
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,160
it will be quite useful to have that and

1480
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:17,930
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually does go towards</font>

1481
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:22,610
you know achieving some of these goals

1482
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:24,980
may be so I'll propose this no condition

1483
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:27,620
control work gets standardized they all

1484
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:29,690
show up in icc RG there are only RG

1485
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:32,720
documents because there is no end<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any</font>

1486
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:34,280
one of those things it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fine world to</font>

1487
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:36,170
live in all we need is documentation

1488
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:39,769
they don't need to get sanitized at all

1489
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:41,600
not even cubic sorry not even cubic not

1490
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:43,580
even kidding why Sunday's cubic it's

1491
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:47,230
already even like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google's deployed vbr</font>

1492
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:49,910
and others are likely to do other things

1493
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:53,059
why are we standardizing a congestion

1494
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:53,389
controller so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the difference is</font>

1495
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:56,390
the

1496
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:58,190
ietf consensus right and your bird<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1497
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the message through my gif is this one</font>

1498
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:02,839
is safe to use we know this one is safe

1499
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:05,060
to use it's not gimmicks not safe cubix

1500
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,440
deployed I mean the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason is analyzing</font>

1501
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,090
it is not because we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and</font>

1502
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,620
said that it's a safe thing to use yeah

1503
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I got together and said it's being used</font>

1504
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:13,430
by a ton of companies therefore it must

1505
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,900
be seized yeah it's we use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

1506
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:18,530
while in the internet that didn't melt

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much that's what I called ECB that's</font>

a form that can be published so it can

1519

be referenced before I yield the mic to

<font color="#CCCCCC">there is as praveen says is that there's</font>

1530
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:18,110
a good process that anybody could follow

1531
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:22,970
to figure out exactly where to go for

1532
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:24,530
any of this stuff I really think that we

1533
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:27,620
should leave condition control where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1534

is which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolving all the time we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">should embrace that I don't think</font>

1536
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:34,009
there's a reason to say that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1537
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:35,660

1538
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:36,800
get anybody to use a standard that we

01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend it's always going to be in the</font>

1540
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:46,820
past yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can concur very strong with</font>

1541
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:48,290
that I'm one of the clues about all of

1542
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:50,210
the congestion controls about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how well</font>

1543
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:53,420
they're doing is you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the control</font>

1544
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:55,730
frequency I from in<font color="#E5E5E5"> years gave a slide</font>

1545
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:57,530
some of the one that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chung showed</font>

1546
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:58,879
earlier which you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack crack</font>

01:12:57,530 --> 01:13:01,340
packet loss<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to run it some</font>

1548
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:04,880
ridiculously high rate well some normal

1549
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:07,429
high rate today is point<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 something or</font>

1550
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,400
another percent but the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue</font>

1551
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:12,559
is for cute for Reno and under those

1552
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,808
environments that correct loss rate is

1553
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:17,539
one loss episode every many tens of

1554
01:13:14,809 --> 01:13:20,329
minutes it's like you can't control a

1555
01:13:17,539 --> 01:13:23,090
system that way and and the in the

1556
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:25,009
controls the the real fundamental issue

1557
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:27,800
is the control frequency has to be in

1558
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:30,320
the right range and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not change</font>

1559
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,119
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you increase the data rate we</font>

1560
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,789
understand this now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order for it</font>

1561
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:38,839
to scale right and that means that that

1562
01:13:34,789 --> 01:13:40,039
the loss rate any I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to I</font>

1563
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want to go into details the</font>

1564
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:44,659
problem with cubic is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way</font>

1565
01:13:41,929 --> 01:13:47,059
the exponential phase goes as the scale

1566
01:13:44,659 --> 01:13:49,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets larger the control frequency</font>

1567
01:13:47,059 --> 01:13:51,019
doesn't keep dropping I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font>

1568
01:13:49,489 --> 01:13:53,509
the numbers haven't worked much with

1569
01:13:51,019 --> 01:13:55,999
cubic and believe it stays it a few

1570
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:58,219
seconds the amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it overshoots</font>

1571
01:13:55,999 --> 01:14:00,400
when it overshoots increases and so it

1572
01:13:58,219 --> 01:14:03,170
slams everybody else on the network and

1573
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:06,469
that effect gets worse as the network

1574
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:07,939
gets faster and and as a consequence

1575
01:14:06,469 --> 01:14:10,760
people who are competing with cubic at a

1576
01:14:07,939 --> 01:14:12,769
big scale networks often get drive by

1577
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:14,329
verse losses that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large that</font>

1578
01:14:12,769 --> 01:14:18,110
they had nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contribute did not</font>

1579
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:20,030

1580
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:21,499
sentiment that we that congestion

control is going to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing for a</font>

mirror I'm Tim Shepherd I'm not sure I

1585
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:40,880
really want to disagree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> what matter</font>

1586
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:44,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jonna just said but I one thing is the</font>

1587
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:46,579
audience of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the RFC's people who are</font>

1588
01:14:44,749 --> 01:14:47,989
like diving into the rfcs because they

1589
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:49,849
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how the internet</font>

1590
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:52,249
works because maybe they got handed a

01:14:49,849 --> 01:14:54,050
piece of the project they're working

1592
01:14:52,249 --> 01:14:55,340
somewhere and they're on some project

1593
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:56,809
and they're building something<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:59,360
engineers they're working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineers</font>

1595
01:14:56,809 --> 01:15:00,949
and they're the ones they're like oh and

1596
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:04,030
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need a TCP implementation</font>

1597
01:15:00,949 --> 01:15:06,919
and for whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons they can't just</font>

1598
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:09,228
use the Linux kernel or something and

1599
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,459
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh boy we're in order to show</font>

1600
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:12,170
you need right when from scratch and

1601
01:15:10,459 --> 01:15:14,239
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right a TCP a limitation from</font>

1602
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:17,090
scratch they probably should put

1603
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:19,039
something in there the involving

1604
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:21,020
congestion control other than what they

1605
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:27,740
can of other than what they might have

1606
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:28,940
imagine from reading TF RFC 793 and I I

1607
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:33,200
can't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it says about</font>

1608
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:35,570
congestion control right and so and so I

1609
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,580
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably useful and not such</font>

1610
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:39,320
a bad thing for the ITF to have a

1611
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:42,250
default pointer that points to some

1612
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:45,080
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> this says you should do</font>

1613
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:47,750
something and I'm not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I care</font>

1614
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:49,190
which thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pointer is pointing at</font>

1615
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:51,410
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment but that's probably a</font>

1616
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:53,929
reasonable thing and it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1617
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:56,059
so horribly wrong that some person who's

1618
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:58,640
doing from scratch<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP implementation</font>

1619
01:15:56,060 --> 01:16:01,310
for some reason implements Reno in it

1620
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,930
and then they run it through a whole

1621
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:04,400
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of testing and it all seems to</font>

1622
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:06,410
work and they deploy it and they start

1623
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,299
shipping their<font color="#E5E5E5"> products then has</font>

1624
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:10,880
anything bad happened because they did

1625
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:13,250
that I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I mean</font>

1626
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:16,190
unless something shows up so maybe you

1627
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:19,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">know for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that person for somebody in</font>

1628
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:21,710
that situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that the IETF is</font>

1629
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:23,930
pointing at Reno is probably not such a

1630
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:27,170
horrible thing as long as it's

1631
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:30,590
understood that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might have reasons</font>

1632
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:33,200
to do something other than Reno if

1633
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:34,730
you're some you know if you're one of

1634
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:38,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">the world's largest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies and you</font>

1635
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:40,879
have lots of data centers maybe you

1636
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,549
should have staff that think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

1637
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:46,490
the right thing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is better than</font>

1638
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:50,260
doreen oh and that's fine too is that

1639
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:50,260
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok maybe we're all everything's fine</font>

1640
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:04,000
give me here you're up oh yes can you

1641
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:08,750
hear me I just make sure mike is working

1642
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:11,120
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah i synchro actually I want to</font>

1643
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:13,100
the presenter to go back one slide I

1644
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:15,860
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say something about the social</font>

1645
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:20,830
aspect of this discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we can</font>

1646
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:20,830
leave this rice come move back one page

1647
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:32,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok can you go back to 1p yeah the one</font>

1648
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:32,440
page number two

1649
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:44,420
see what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you prefer</font>

1650
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:52,850
you can simply click click on the page

1651
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:58,640
number to this right one no that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

1652
01:17:52,850 --> 01:18:04,700
number two yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one score and</font>

1653
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:09,980
score<font color="#E5E5E5"> historic yeah that's how many area</font>

1654
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:12,769
directors does it take yes I want to

1655
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring up one one one issue I think I</font>

1656
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:17,450
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard address I think this is</font>

1657
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:20,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more like going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a social</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

1658
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:22,309
now is not only technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1659
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:25,280
talking basically the conch you of

1660
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:27,650
congestion control and if we look on

1661
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:30,110
this this particular slide we see all

1662
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:32,929
the competing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick already been deployed</font>

1663
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:35,630
by different the platform and behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1664
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:37,820
each platform there is a company so i

1665
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:40,400
think i originally if we back 20 years

1666
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago the continued continued discussions</font>

1667
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:45,710
that one is is evolving around the

1668
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:48,890
environment which everybody has assumed

1669
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:50,960
the open Internet everybody's have a

1670
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:53,330
nice behavior so everybody need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1671
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,880
friendly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that probably is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the PSP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for endless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the term</font>

actually come from that environment but

1674
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:03,769
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our reality now is we are</font>

1683
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:24,290
probably a little matter very easy right

1684
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:26,809
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> of evil what if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

understand that the the user to have

1699
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:10,730
idea their application<font color="#E5E5E5"> is always going</font>

1700
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:13,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deliver some kind of food good</font>

01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:18,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Armory's just let it run a race and</font>

1703
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:19,910
admitted us identify what is the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the weapon what is the best that they've</font>

1705
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:23,360
already come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> or from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that our</font>

1706
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:27,219
memories which you will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> most robust</font>

1707
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,219
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hyper consists in the performance</font>

1708
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:36,740
thank you I can just add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this point</font>

1709
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:38,330
that like we have how many I don't know

1710
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:40,400
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of congenital research</font>

1711
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:42,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">there like tons of algorithms out there</font>

1712
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:47,120
and we see like very limited deployment

1713
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:48,889
of new other isms and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1714
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:52,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">because people just don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know which one</font>

1715
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use and we recently see little bit</font>

1716
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:56,690
more deployment because one case is<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

1717
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you see because the traditional</font>

1718
01:20:56,690 --> 01:21:02,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">conditional read doesn't apply here then</font>

1719
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:03,799
the other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a big company</font>

1720
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:06,050
and you have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of resources and</font>

1721
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:09,500
you can just do some experiments but

1722
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:11,360
other than that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really don't</font>

1723
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">know which one to use if they implement</font>

1724
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:18,380
anything on their own if they want to

1725
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:20,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">use TCP the only thing they can go to at</font>

1726
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:23,150
the moment is New Reno and then at some

1727
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:26,840
point they look at their transmissions

1728
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:29,000
and their quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of experience metrics</font>

1729
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,130
whatever that is and they see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

1730
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,810
sucks because TC periods not really

1731
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:35,150
optimized<font color="#CCCCCC"> for today's network and then</font>

1732
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:37,100
they say oh that's TCP it doesn't work I

1733
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:38,599
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write any protocol and at the</font>

1734
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:40,700
end it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just they use a different the</font>

1735
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:42,260
wrong under control and as long as we

1736
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:47,360
don't give any further guidance then use

1737
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:48,680
TCP Reno this will be going on so yeah I

1738
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,509
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the guidance is but I</font>

1739
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:56,690
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> super happy if you can get if</font>

1740
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:57,620
any better guidance than that so I came

1741
01:21:56,690 --> 01:21:59,030
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually it sort of agree with</font>

1742
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,590
Tim right so I don't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

1743
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:02,650
have a big problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't</font>

1744
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:06,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">take the case that Mayor describes is</font>

1745
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:09,500
it's pretty theoretical but I mean who

1746
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:11,780
here writes a new stack and then deploys

1747
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:13,400
it on on an amount of systems that may

1748
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:15,980
can move the needle anywhere on the

1749
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:17,750
global<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet almost nobody right that</font>

1750
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:18,888
the big stacks are incredibly tightly

1751
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:21,380
controlled there's a lot of engineering

1752
01:22:18,889 --> 01:22:23,989
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and I don't think it's an arms</font>

1753
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:25,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">race either either right because um we</font>

1754
01:22:23,989 --> 01:22:28,940
have this going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bittorrent and</font>

1755
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:31,280
skype right<font color="#E5E5E5"> BitTorrent got hammered</font>

1756
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:33,409
because they they basically broke people

1757
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,989
skype calls right and if if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix</font>

1758
01:22:33,409 --> 01:22:38,000
started interfering<font color="#E5E5E5"> with I don't know</font>

1759
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:39,379
what skype or or some Google service

1760
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,389
right all hell will break loose it so

1761
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:43,190
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in everybody's best</font>

1762
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:44,989
interest to avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that situation right</font>

1763
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:47,449
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually pretty far from</font>

1764
01:22:44,989 --> 01:22:50,178
her not from an arms race here I do

1765
01:22:47,449 --> 01:22:51,530
agree that we want to have that what Tim

1766
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:53,449
said right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to have something</font>

1767
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:55,580
that people can constrain reading and

1768
01:22:53,449 --> 01:22:57,500
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning and you know New Reno is</font>

1769
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:59,510
is you know yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not ideal but it's</font>

1770
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:02,840
also not terrible and it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1771
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:05,150
easily understandable um the other

1772
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:07,310
analogy is going to make right that so

1773
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:10,070
transport is very similar to security in

1774
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:12,920
terms of IETF right both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those areas</font>

1775
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:14,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">about telling other people no no no you</font>

1776
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:17,929
can't send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that packet right or not know</font>

1777
01:23:14,869 --> 01:23:21,019
you can send that indicate so um and and

1778
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:23,090
in security right crypto schemes change

1779
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:25,159
security protocols changed is you know

1780
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:26,449
if you look in TLS right there's there's

1781
01:23:25,159 --> 01:23:27,769
a bunch of cipher suites that we're

1782
01:23:26,449 --> 01:23:29,089
deprecating there's new ones they were

1783
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:30,770
putting in based on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1784
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:32,989
understanding it the attackers can do

1785
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:35,659
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the capabilities are and that's</font>

1786
01:23:32,989 --> 01:23:37,428
fine right it's a continuously changing

1787
01:23:35,659 --> 01:23:39,379
thing and it's it's similar in transport

1788
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:41,510
right i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> our pace of changes is</font>

1789
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:43,520
slower but it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing right we</font>

1790
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:45,830
we had no reno and maybe now we have

1791
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:48,139
cubic which is better in some cases and

1792
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:51,080
worse and others and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1793
01:23:48,139 --> 01:23:52,130
more specialized ones that that are

1794
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:55,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">never going to really run on the</font>

1795
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:57,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet anyway um and that's okay right</font>

1796
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:58,429
if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

1797
01:23:57,170 --> 01:24:01,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the plunger and we're gonna</font>

1798
01:23:58,429 --> 01:24:02,739
say look at you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> bbr for example</font>

1799
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:05,420
like in a couple of years or something

1800
01:24:02,739 --> 01:24:06,320
it's okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it is a big</font>

1801
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:09,409
problem and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an</font>

1802
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:11,750
arms race necessarily happening I want

1803
01:24:09,409 --> 01:24:14,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">to add to that so but butter bloat is a</font>

1804
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:16,220
problem and we know for example that

1805
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:19,070
big is worsening it and at this point

1806
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:22,490
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an arms race but if you were</font>

1807
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:23,929
kind of trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> compete for the same</font>

1808
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:26,870
bottleneck link you would have to

1809
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:28,220
implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> cubed vx6 right so there is a</font>

1810
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:31,280
problem so it's not like there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1811
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:33,170
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so I mean many of these</font>

1812
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,269
have problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right Oh make all of</font>

1813
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:36,920
the congestion controllers work in it

1814
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:40,120
better in some cases and worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

1815
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:43,520
others<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know it's more about how</font>

1816
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:44,599
large the usable envelope is um and

1817
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,010
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can that can be</font>

1818
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,750
described right and maybe that's

1819
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:50,090
something that that could be an

1820
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:54,080
experiment document out of icche I don't

1821
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:57,370
know um but but very few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them have</font>

1822
01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:01,850
sort of catastrophic failures and and

1823
01:24:57,370 --> 01:25:04,160
buffer plot is is something that that a

1824
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:06,020
congestion controller can't really do

1825
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:08,660
anything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> any way or its operating</font>

1826
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:10,310
over the path that it's been given<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1827
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:11,780
not saying we shouldn't fix it right we

1828
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:13,400
should we definitely shouldn't up but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1829
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:20,599
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think it's necessarily a</font>

1830
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:23,000
congestion control problem we have five

1831
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:26,720
minutes left just listen L this morning

1832
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:31,070
I in the ICC RG meeting I try to start a

1833
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion about the round trip time and</font>

1834
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:36,380
rates dependency on the marking signal

1835
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:39,110
and I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very relevant</font>

1836
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:42,800
discussion around this because today

1837
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:44,650
it's not so scalable like Reno the high

1838
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:48,140
of the rates the lower the marking

1839
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:50,599
signal extremely low becomes extremely

1840
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:52,760
though so I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should open again</font>

1841
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:55,310
the discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how should a</font>

1842
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:58,940
congestion control response and what is

1843
01:25:55,310 --> 01:26:03,230
best to do have a scalable signal so

1844
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:05,480
that we can go forward to it with drop

1845
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:09,169
compatibility and marking especially

1846
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:13,669
marking compatibility and and and and

1847
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:15,790
today there is I think there are

1848
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:18,410
possibilities also to make it compatible

1849
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:20,240
at a certain rate also for the normal

1850
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:22,730
drop compatibility that we have today

1851
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:24,559
because okay when it's it doesn't work

1852
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:28,120
very well we can improve it by cubic

1853
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:31,040
improved on Reno I think we can

1854
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:33,710
move the scalability to the positive

1855
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:36,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">side and make it compatible for normal</font>

1856
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:38,090
situations with<font color="#CCCCCC"> RINO and cubic but if</font>

1857
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:40,430
the round<font color="#E5E5E5"> trip times become bigger than</font>

1858
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:44,030
the Rays become bigger we can improve

1859
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:46,340
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> correct</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what's what's going</font>

1860
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:49,660
wrong so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe there there is an</font>

1861
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:54,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome everybody to</font>

1862
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:56,750
join that discussion there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1863
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:58,910
mutually conflicting constraints on all

1864
01:26:56,750 --> 01:27:01,520
the players but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to point out one</font>

1865
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:04,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe didn't occur to people if</font>

1866
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:07,520
you're selling advertising for instance

1867
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:08,840
and somebody clicks on an ad and the

1868
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,790
entertainment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they happen to be</font>

1869
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,220
watching interferes with the ad loading

1870
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:17,000
you've done a very bad thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yourself</font>

1871
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:19,520
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ad comes from somebody</font>

1872
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,070
else's server using some unknown

1873
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:24,710
technology or i should say the content

1874
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:26,179
the click-through goes to somebody

1875
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:28,400
else's server and somebody else's

1876
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:31,970
content and so there's a very very

1877
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:34,519
severe extreme penalty for being too

1878
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:37,240
aggressive and although this isn't apply

1879
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:43,000
everywhere it applies in enough places

1880
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:49,070
to cause people to be cautious<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1881
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:53,420
certainly applies to google to say the

1882
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:57,349
least but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact we do need to have a</font>

1883
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:59,690
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially in the cases where bbr</font>

1884
01:27:57,350 --> 01:28:01,370
for example does very poorly relative to

1885
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:03,950
cubic under some easily demonstrated

1886
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:06,590
conditions it's like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story</font>

1887
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:12,830
you tell and part of the story is we'd

1888
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:14,090
like cubic to just go away um but we

1889
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:16,070
can't cause<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to happen in the</font>

1890
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:18,110
transit case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have fairness well</font>

1891
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:20,960
guess what we don't have fairness today

1892
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:23,330
it never existed it never will exist it

1893
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:25,040
just has different symptoms in different

1894
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:29,059
cases we want to avoid starvation we

1895
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:31,160
want to avoid other pathologies but like

1902

yes good I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow up with</font>

example I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's one area where we</font>

what's happening thank you yeah very

1910
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:22,890
quick um I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to understand</font>

1911
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:25,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet for a long time longer than</font>

1912
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:27,270
I would care to even admit and part of

1913
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:28,890
the challenge of I'm trying to

1914
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:33,090
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet is by the time I</font>

1915
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:35,580
figured it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1916
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:37,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's different and I think this you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1917
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:43,200
the whole notion that TCP friendly is

1918
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:44,730
sort of difficult to to think about

1919
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:47,070
these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the fact that the</font>

1920
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:48,690
net is just been changing and I'm so I'm

1921
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:50,429
actually used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the fact that the net</font>

1922
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:53,549
keeps changing by the time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder I</font>

1923
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:56,070
think I've understood it and just like a

1924
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:59,340
week and a half ago I watched a video of

1925
01:29:56,070 --> 01:30:02,070
Jeff Houston a talk he gave I think

1926
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:04,680
three or four weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> at apricot 2017</font>

1927
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:07,230
and there's a youtube video it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1928
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:09,360
find his his talk by searching on

1929
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:13,709
YouTube unless you know exactly what to

1930
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:16,799
search for and it's apricot 2017 panel

1931
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:19,080
forces shaping the network and that's on

1932
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube it's like a 90 minute video and</font>

1933
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,430
his talk starts about halfway into that

1934
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:26,790
video and the title of his talk is the

1935
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:28,800
death of transit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beyond and what he</font>

1936
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:30,120
by transit he means the interconnect

1937
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,910
like when you if you want to get

1938
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:34,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet you connect</font>

1939
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:36,780
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who can offer you transit</font>

1940
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:39,840
and he actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> told a story that</font>

1941
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:41,580
convinced me that in some surprisingly

1942
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,760
short<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of years from now people</font>

1943
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:48,000
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not care if they're if their</font>

1944
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:51,660
internet connection actually has transit

1945
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,340
or not and I probably should stop there

1946
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:55,200
and try it instead of trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain</font>

1947
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:57,000
why that might be true

1948
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,380
anyway but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that tie I've watched</font>

1949
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,300
that talk two times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've already</font>

1950
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:02,400
recommended it to about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dozen people</font>

1951
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:04,670
and I realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be relevant</font>

1952
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,990
to people who are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

1953
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:10,530
what should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do for congestion control</font>

1954
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:13,710
in the future and that if you watch his

1955
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:16,380
talk it might reset you because you to

1956
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:18,240
stop and wonder what you actually

1957
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:22,440
believe anymore about what the internet

1958
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:23,940
is so anyway I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it like his talk</font>

1959
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:26,330
because I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it amazing I don't know</font>

1960
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:31,730
if Jeff even<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the might be in the room</font>

1961
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:31,730
no maybe not anyway saying that was it

1962
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:37,560
we have a very very silent mailing list

1963
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:39,540
on icc edgy and I keep repeating that

1964
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:40,740
people people you know because there's

1965
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:42,540
so much interest and people want to

1966
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:46,980
discuss but then they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> send emails</font>

1967
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:50,430
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list so please oh yeah we're done</font>

1968
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:52,410
basically sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all right I'm</font>

1969
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:55,230
already so thank you very much for the

1970
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion I think this was a very good</font>

1971
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:59,429
discussion and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through the</font>

1972
01:31:56,730 --> 01:32:00,690
minutes and also the java chat and see

1973
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:03,180
if there's anything we could actually

1974
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:05,429
write down and con conserve for the

1975
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,810
future<font color="#CCCCCC"> and give some guidance but other</font>

1976
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">than that I don't see any action points</font>

1977
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:10,260
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just operate as</font>

1978
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:13,490
we're operating right now and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1979
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:13,490
for your presentations
