40
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,540
the ITF website revamp and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to</font>

41
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,340
talk with you all today for just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

42
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,429
little bit there are a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goals</font>

43
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,840
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have in mind one of them is to</font>

44
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,410
just give an update of where we are on

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,019
this project which was started a while

46
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,019
ago and has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> making steady progress</font>

47
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:12,630
recently sort of accelerating so where

48
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:15,650
are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the two is to maybe prompt</font>

49
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:22,019
you all to start thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

50
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:23,489
providing some input and and review but

51
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,739
then the third one is to just sort of

52
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,720
check in with you to make sure that

53
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:32,489
where we are is kind of on track in

54
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:38,310
terms of what we we the ITF community

55
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:39,720
needs from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website so I'll run</font>

56
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,510
through pretty quickly i'm hoping to

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a number of minutes at the end of</font>

58
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">this to have some questions discussion</font>

59
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:51,120
and certainly this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

60
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:56,510
of the first opportunities so this isn't

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,510
this is just a beginning

62
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,190
yeah so I wanted to start things up by

63
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,659
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> prompting some questions at the</font>

64
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,060
beginning so you can have them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind</font>

65
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:09,519
as we get through the presentation

66
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:13,090
they're on there on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> site here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

67
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,340
they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mirror some of the on the</font>

68
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,959
slide here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of here are</font>

69
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,478
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions that we asked the</font>

70
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,990
initial phase of research that was done

71
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:27,010
to help provide direction for where the

72
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">website should evolve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um so you can</font>

73
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,889
read them here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them up</font>

74
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:36,370
again at the end of the end of the

75
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:38,590
presentation that I have to make just

76
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,650
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> quick a compressed version of the</font>

77
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">history so I think it's almost two years</font>

78
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,330
ago now actually we started drafting the

79
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,239
scope of work that was shared with the

80
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:53,590
on the ITF at IDF list got some really

81
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,900
good input and<font color="#E5E5E5"> our work with the ia ia</font>

82
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,609
OC technology management committee I

83
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,359
supposed to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools committee but</font>

84
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,729
I think that's the official name to work

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,120
through the actual scope of work which

86
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:09,010
is posted on the ilc site and make of a

87
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,490
selection on the vendor which is torch

88
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:17,830
box there's also a link to them I think

89
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:19,360
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IOC site and then part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

90
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,159
scope of work was to establish a

91
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,229
community review committee so the idea

92
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,280
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have sort of an ongoing sounding</font>

93
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:29,039
board for the project that would be

94
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,539
provide some immediate feedback and

95
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,400
correction if needed or how the work was

96
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:36,520
progressing into that that has worked

97
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,310
pretty well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you saw from yards</font>

98
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,580
note earlier this week or last week<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

99
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:47,229
guess that Joe no Joe Hildebrand was the

100
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:49,659
initial project manager and did a lot of

101
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:53,550
great work and now Russ<font color="#CCCCCC"> housley has</font>

102
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:56,410
taken over as the project manager so

103
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,270
yeah so the last thing as I mentioned

104
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,310
one of the first steps also<font color="#CCCCCC"> is once we</font>

105
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,289
got the vendor in places to do some

106
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,599
research to figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was working</font>

107
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:06,039
and what wasn't working based on the

108
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,219
requirements set forth in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope of</font>

109
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,219
work

110
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,000
and part of those part of the

111
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,400
requirements were that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF website</font>

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,380
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> some very specific the dub dub dub</font>

113
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,780
part specifically i should say one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

114
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things is the work of</font>

115
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:30,270
scopes dub dub dub that<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea org and</font>

116
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:33,719
there are a lot of other web assets or

117
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,909
web presence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that we know that</font>

118
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:41,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the idea of community specifically uses</font>

119
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:44,130
so like data tracker or or others but

120
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:49,469
this is this is specifically this

121
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:55,170
project is specifically scoped on WWF

122
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:57,210
org yeah the other thing we did was talk

123
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the three audience that are specified</font>

124
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the scope of work is active</font>

125
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,780
participant so folks like you folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

126
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,850
come to ITF meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> you participate on</font>

127
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,150
mailing lists proactively<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaged you</font>

128
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,850
already know about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea potential</font>

129
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,650
participants so people who are either

130
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,380
working in the technical areas that the

131
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:21,539
ITF covers or perhaps people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

132
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:23,010
considering or working there or so forth

133
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the last where people will</font>

134
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">never ever participate in the ITF but</font>

135
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,960
who need to know why what the ITF does

136
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:35,340
and why it's important so here you might

137
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,469
think about telecom regulators or people

138
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,549
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in other parts of the sort of</font>

139
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:46,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Governance world so those are</font>

140
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:49,380
the kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of books we had in mind sorry</font>

141
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,880
professors wives yet or your family

142
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:56,719
members right so like why are you

143
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">spending all this time in Chicago and so</font>

144
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:09,659
audience research findings so yeah so

145
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,998
there was a there's a there's a long

146
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:14,489
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of this but this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

147
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:16,399
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a summary of the summary and I</font>

148
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:18,929
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> these three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> points were</font>

149
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,779
representative of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the broad</font>

150
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:24,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven views of just a real quick back</font>

151
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,249
note about the research most of it

152
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,199
relied on interviews with people who

153
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:31,439
sort of came from those three audiences

154
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,269
so as well as some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of best</font>

155
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,689
practices benchmarking across other

156
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:38,339
organizations and you can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there</font>

157
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:41,188
again but in short it's basically the

158
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,949
current website again ww sort of serves

159
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:45,779
a very limited set of users and I think

160
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:51,750
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really is the people who already you</font>

161
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:54,509
about the ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thorg I sorry the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF that</font>

162
00:08:51,750 --> 00:09:00,060
significant improvements could be made

163
00:08:54,509 --> 00:09:04,110
to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it serves the broader</font>

164
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,508
<font color="#CCCCCC">community another another part in here</font>

165
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,449
that isn't highlighted but i think is

166
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:11,610
represented in the design you'll see is

167
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:14,758
that really the focus needs to be on the

168
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,129
work of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF right so that is it's</font>

169
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,209
that the work of the IDF is

170
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:21,029
distinguishing characteristic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we</font>

171
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,319
shouldn't lose that there was some

172
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion on the mail in this for</font>

173
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:26,610
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope of work was circulated</font>

174
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:29,399
that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sure that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF</font>

175
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:35,100
website the ww presence doesn't devolve

176
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:37,019
into a marketing flash dependent kind of

177
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,199
website right it has to reflect the

178
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:44,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual ethos of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF itself which</font>

179
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:50,008
shouldn't lose that so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

180
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:52,199
go into screenshots so these these are

181
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,689
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of before and before is the</font>

182
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:56,339
current IDF website as of I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

183
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:57,269
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week and a half ago or two</font>

184
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:01,620
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and might be slightly different</font>

185
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:06,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it's representative and the after is</font>

186
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,610
sort of the mock-up of the website as

187
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:11,329
proposed and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are screenshots that</font>

188
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:15,660
actually were shown earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

189
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:17,739
last year for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example and to the to the</font>

190
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,819
community and

191
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,529
earlier we actually have the vendor on

192
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,020
site at a 90 f meeting to have

193
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:26,750
interactions with the with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF</font>

194
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,339
participants so so these haven't changed

195
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:33,890
much but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a reminder what kind of</font>

196
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:35,390
what it looks like another another

197
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,430
example of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the requirements of</font>

198
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,350
the scope of workers that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

199
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,609
needs to work better on different kinds

200
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of devices with different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sized</font>

201
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:47,600
viewports the current site oh I did yeah

202
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,370
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> switched it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nevermind time</font>

203
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,950
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> is linear we didn't go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in time</font>

204
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,500
yeah so the labels are switched but you

205
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:57,800
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily tell as you noted which is</font>

206
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:03,680
before which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is after and this is an</font>

207
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:05,420
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the blog specifically and</font>

208
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,989
then and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lastly this is just an</font>

209
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:12,529
example of an event page also label

210
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:14,570
switch this is what you get when you try

211
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and improve your prove your slides just</font>

212
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:20,390
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> this session but but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

213
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,520
kind of a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> look a little</font>

214
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:28,459
different feel and works better on

215
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:29,870
different devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we'll see if this</font>

216
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,949
actually works on how this has to work

217
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,750
because I was sort of expecting a

218
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,290
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup but i'll give you I'll</font>

219
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,290
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what is</font>

220
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:52,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so this is on a development</font>

221
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:55,090
server and the screen resolution

222
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,560
actually of the projector is not ideal

223
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:03,020
but but it does show the responsiveness

224
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:05,660
of the website so um my<font color="#E5E5E5"> planned</font>

225
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:24,730
walkthrough might not work so well but

226
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll show you what that email client</font>

227
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,750
yeah so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example this is kind</font>

228
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,130
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the examples that I'll</font>

229
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">give and probably the only ones before</font>

230
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:45,370
time well that didn't really work as I

231
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:47,750
expected but one of the features of this

232
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,240
one of the features that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual the</font>

233
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,580
vendor suggested is to tie directly into

234
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,980
data tracker to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

235
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:59,330
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like rfcs and inner drafts</font>

236
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:03,440
and working groups so that people people

237
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:04,910
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in the larger version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

238
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,670
that people get previews of those

239
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">elements in the dub dub dub site so the</font>

240
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is to really tie those two parts</font>

241
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:17,000
together in a way that not only provides

242
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,400
current information but also makes the

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">point that I TF is about getting the</font>

244
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,650
technical work done and drawing people

245
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:27,770
into the tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually used by</font>

246
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,949
the IDF participants I know we're so

247
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,949
online

248
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,410
let me just skip ahead here so what's

249
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:47,019
next so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some show-and-tell</font>

250
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:51,850
at the ITF there's a table down by the

251
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:53,290
bridge<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> registration and I I think</font>

252
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,519
there's one more sweet we've been there

253
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">a couple of times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

254
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,300
session look yet this week it's either

255
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,009
tomorrow morning or friday morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

256
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,689
need to check my calendar and i'll be

257
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:03,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can we can play with the</font>

258
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:08,199
website so i encourage you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come by if</font>

259
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:09,670
you have time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that otherwise based</font>

260
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:12,069
on the feedback that we're getting both

261
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,439
from IT participants but also testing

262
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:17,979
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other audiences we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

263
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:23,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">start reviewing and revising the current</font>

264
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:26,559
setup once we will also revised content

265
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,729
not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a CMS and technical</font>

266
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,618
side of things but the content as well

267
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,019
to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's working for everybody</font>

268
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:35,589
and then once we're satisfied with that

269
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:38,220
we'll move to production so hoping that

270
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:40,829
that will be done before the next IETF

271
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,720
meeting but the goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it right</font>

272
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:47,079
so definitely going to end on the

273
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,720
feedback that everybody provides and

274
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:51,489
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see into my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides I want to</font>

275
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions oh yeah can you</font>

276
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,470
just put up the questions that you had

277
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,029
we were in group chairs um so part of

278
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,910
the reason for doing this in this

279
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:02,829
particular forum was this this community

280
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,469
represents the experienced<font color="#E5E5E5"> IET efforts</font>

281
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:08,199
and one of the things that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

282
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">for is how exactly do experience IHF is</font>

283
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:14,559
actually use the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is the</font>

284
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:16,329
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they you know or do you</font>

285
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,549
possibly not use it very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean is</font>

286
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:20,008
do you primarily use data tracker so

287
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:22,209
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

288
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:23,920
anyway so with that are there any

289
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:30,638
questions for Gregor any comments

290
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:33,549
feedback one comment one question so I

291
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,059
think when you list it when you listed

292
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:43,779
the audience's we were number one it

293
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:45,079
shouldn't be i would say potential idea

294
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,080
participer

295
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:51,800
and the rest of the community should be

296
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">number one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and not us and and then a</font>

297
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,260
question is search engine optimization

298
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,120
and scope for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> project I'm sorry I</font>

299
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,810
didn't catch the question its search

300
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,880
engine optimization SEO is it in scope

301
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,040
of the project because if you look up

302
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,820
security standards or networking

303
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,810
standard oh and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuel if you</font>

304
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,030
type ITF on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google what comes up is idea</font>

305
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:21,650
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though there are no idea</font>

306
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:24,640
of members yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

307
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,480
this answer your question is no but

308
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,430
certainly it's something we could look

309
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,310
at falling onto the overall goal of

310
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:35,319
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential participants find</font>

311
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:38,150
the right information short answers now

312
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,760
Rick<font color="#E5E5E5"> Taylor and just answer someone of</font>

313
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:43,100
your questions and I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight to the</font>

314
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,460
data tracker for my day-to-day chair

315
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,830
stuff the only time i use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF oxide</font>

316
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,770
is to work out where the hotel is and

317
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,390
how to do that and that's it's a pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

318
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,210
find at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> so improvements are</font>

319
00:16:53,390 --> 00:17:00,500
great and like that's as a chair what I

320
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:06,050
use it for but I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chair thank</font>

321
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:09,829
you get one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do use</font>

322
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:11,659
the ATF site for is the existing site

323
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,810
has a set of links down left down left

324
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">comms very easy to tell people just go</font>

325
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:24,560
to IETF not work and click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this link</font>

326
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:27,109
to do that yeah we've heard that Tim

327
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,540
John yeah plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> two I was just about to</font>

328
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:31,010
say is I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that left pane there</font>

329
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,750
is so useful things like submitting a

330
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,160
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the little quick links</font>

331
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,290
that there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are handy so I think</font>

332
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is great to have a nice public</font>

333
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,800
front as long as everything from the

334
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,570
data tracker and those points of things

335
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,930
that they're behind it and we've got

336
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,669
that path in that's great so it looks

337
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,080
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good but my king question is</font>

338
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,390
though I'm still<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure I've not seen</font>

339
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything about this until today where do</font>

340
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,320
we go to actually see these mock-ups and

341
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,640
to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you some feedback is that</font>

342
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,040
possible yet you said you wanted

343
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">feedback but I've no idea still where to</font>

344
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,909
go and give it

345
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:06,170
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're still working that</font>

346
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:08,000
out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact evac mechanism but you'll</font>

347
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,530
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll either be obviously</font>

348
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,050
there'll be an email address of amenity

349
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,879
other ways to do it as well and will

350
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:18,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide more be back part of the process</font>

351
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,720
i think is to provide early access to

352
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:23,600
the community to the site so they can

353
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,180
poke around yeah but I take your point

354
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,330
well we'll make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it clearer exactly how</font>

355
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,250
that is done probably next couple of

356
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,439
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's excellent thank you</font>

357
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,880
Tim<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a real quick question are you</font>

358
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,040
talking about feedback this week or

359
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,690
feedback after this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he does</font>

360
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,300
have the table downstairs for feedback

361
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:43,340
this week um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was completely unaware</font>

362
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,629
there's another title I don't know what

363
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,379
table you're talking about it's not

364
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,420
right so um oh yeah the table is the

365
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,850
table is right by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF registration</font>

366
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,500
desk and I can send a note out to this

367
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,600
list<font color="#CCCCCC"> that let folks know if there is</font>

368
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,640
such a thing it might be good to make it

369
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear that exists because I I'm sure I'm</font>

370
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,800
not the only one that's missed nothing

371
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,210
okay so um well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> old</font>

372
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">fashioned I maybe I'm just old-fashioned</font>

373
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">gray-haired and stuff so how about we</font>

374
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">had two front pages one for those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

375
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,149
that for the public as it were and one

376
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,500
for the very experienced IETF is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

377
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,780
want to go straight there for for

378
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,580
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> clicking the button to book the</font>

379
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,889
hotel which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of one of the most</font>

380
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,320
urgent tasks you have to do three times

381
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,800
a year I wonder I wonder if that's a

382
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,090
data tracker so yeah but in seven

383
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,550
minutes now I mean you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

384
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,679
nautilus actually go there to your

385
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,740
poster meeting times to do that and yet

386
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:42,290
it seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hidden below hackathons</font>

387
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:44,780
being is important to standards so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

388
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:48,139
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my number one use of the first</font>

389
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:50,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">page is as a jumping-off place to a lot</font>

390
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:56,429
of places just a very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice compact</font>

391
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:58,529
index and I would hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lose that yeah</font>

392
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,559
yeah so what I'm hearing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

393
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:04,320
that same sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of compact set of quick</font>

394
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:06,269
links to places that are often<font color="#CCCCCC"> used by</font>

395
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,830
regular participants is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> handy</font>

396
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:11,220
thing and we should figure out a way to

397
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,600
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that readily available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and please</font>

398
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,119
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> forget to announce your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

399
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,889
please Justin Dean I would like to

400
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">second to comment about that we</font>

401
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:22,070
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the main target audience</font>

402
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:26,178
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front-facing website I like but</font>

403
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,860
you had to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stewart about having a</font>

404
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:31,169
place that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go to quickly get to</font>

405
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,840
ever we need to get but i think the

406
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">front-facing part of it should focus on</font>

407
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,490
potential working group contributors and

408
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,889
specifically getting them the info they

409
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:44,909
need to participate and make it easy and

410
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:47,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">i would say that would be teaching them</font>

411
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:49,110
about the ITF process teaching them

412
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:51,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how they can contribute either by</font>

413
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,100
submitting a draft or contacting the

414
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,070
people they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact to</font>

415
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,990
participate so mailing lists and such

416
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:01,350
and how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> works and the third would</font>

417
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,869
be how to get to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> teas and do</font>

418
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,209
implementations and that sort of thing

419
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:09,090
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would focus on that on the front</font>

420
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,529
facing part<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much so</font>

00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:20,249
the way down from the top is everything

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,928
biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> frustration is not just the</font>

435
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:55,498
bookmark stuff in ietf 52 you know to

get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next meeting or register or</font>

437
00:21:55,499 --> 00:22:01,830
something like that if those links still

438
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:04,590
worked for 98 but since they since they

439
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:08,129
simply move that we have to navigate the

440
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:10,290
thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be helpful for me</font>

441
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,240
there was some stable thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could lake</font>

442
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,420
that good bookmark and they have the

443
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,970
redirect yeah I think that's a that's a

444
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,680
neat comment one thing I failed to

445
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,020
mention in terms of the scope of work

446
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,360
but I Kabul should is that for

447
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:28,050
well-known URLs those are supposed to do

448
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,330
those are required to remain workable so

449
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:34,409
even though the particular parts of the

450
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:37,949
site may move<font color="#E5E5E5"> the URLs that are well</font>

451
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:39,960
known<font color="#CCCCCC"> and publicized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right so I</font>

452
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,090

get that yep Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Alexandra both</font>

459
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:04,590
two very short remarks the first one is

460
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,800
some dough exactly 2 i'm completely

461
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,020
agreeing and that we should focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

462
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,419
on the target here so facilitate the

463
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,310
life of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming and this actually</font>

464
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,340
for me is much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than just the web</font>

465
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:20,190
design so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually looking at what</font>

466
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,050
facilitates know people discovering the

467
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,310
links and so forth and so far they

468
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,430
discover actually discovering the

469
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:27,990
information and for me this is like

470
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,370
completely different I mean this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

471
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,650
first thing to do and then the design

472
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,479
comes afterwards so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

473
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,820
thing to you and the second thing is

00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,810
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would really like to avoid the</font>

quicklinks um which is I've recently

492
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:31,500
suffered through redesigns of various

493
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,960
other web presences that I make frequent

494
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,750
use of and they seem to have a common

495
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">theme of the designer in charge of it</font>

496
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,550
takes a look at it and says you know oh

497

499
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,490
the wall of text and disappear it and

00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know turn it to some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of gradual</font>

501
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">drill down cascading menus blah blah</font>

502
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:55,020
which you know it does make it look

503
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,690
nicer but I really like the wall of text

504
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,580
because I can I can grab the wall of

505
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,410

511
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,240
clicking on one thing and then i can get

515
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,930
last person i've cut off the cute uh so

516
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,380
how often do you go to the dead dead

517
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:31,800
dead site oh well except for you I

518
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:35,460
probably weekly<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay okay thank you</font>

519
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:40,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would answer that like</font>

520
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:43,200
three or four times a week and you

521
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,960
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known URLs the point</font>

522
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,960
is the URLs are not well known they are

523
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,090
well used and we need ways to get to

524
00:25:48,960 --> 00:26:00,030
those things because we don't keep them

525
00:25:51,090 --> 00:26:02,040
all on a brain yep Alyssa Cooper um just

526
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,360
I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plant up one additional</font>

527
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,420
seat in people's heads while you're

528
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,909
thinking about this something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Greg</font>

529
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,710
and I have discussed at some length

530
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:12,270
though other thing that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have on</font>

531
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:17,510
the either the current website or the

532
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:20,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">new website is any way to track usage</font>

533
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:23,430
like none whatsoever so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

534
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,129
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people visit the website which</font>

535
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:28,200
pages are most frequently visited the

536
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,880
path by which people arrive at the site

537
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,170
like whether they actually do search and

538
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,670
eventually find the page you're looking

539
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:35,100
for or whether they just go to the

540
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,869
homepage and navigate we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

541
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,428
of this information

542
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:43,259
and that's for a bunch of historical

543
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:44,970
reasons very<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real concerns about</font>

544
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:46,470
privacy in which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tracking</font>

545
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,690
technology would we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're with</font>

546
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,970
the day to go and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth but</font>

547
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">even after we go through this process</font>

548
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,679
and hopefully eventually you know deploy

549
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:58,200
the new site we won't have an ongoing

550
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,179
way of being able to determine you know

551
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,669
whether it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting its goals</font>

552
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,359
other than you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm chaining</font>

553
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:08,399
qualitative feedback from people so I

554
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:10,559
personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that there is a way</font>

555
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:12,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could add some use the tracking</font>

556
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,149
that is privacy friendly and gives

557
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:18,389
people the ability to not have their own

558
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:19,889
data involved in in the usage tracking

559
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:22,109
if they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and so on and so</font>

560
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:25,529
forth and there's some available tools

561
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:27,359
that do this but if people I think this

562
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:29,849
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good crowd to kind of benchmark</font>

563
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,649
that that intuition so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have</font>

564
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:34,259
feelings about that one way or the other

565
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:36,619
would be interesting to to hear those on

566
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,639
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> or group chairs list after this</font>

567
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:39,988
after the meeting or if you go home and

568
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:41,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about it or as you're looking at</font>

569
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:45,720
the new site so would appreciate

570
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:56,909
feedback on that thank you yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

571
00:27:45,720 --> 00:28:00,059
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good boy thank you Greg Paul so</font>

00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:11,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to give a brief overview</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

576
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:13,228
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of open it up and then you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us on the mic line is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

578
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:19,080
closed because everyone has opinions

579
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:21,928
about github and but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

580
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,928
emphasize is that one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prime goals</font>

581
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:28,200
of the Voth was not to hear people's

582
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:29,820
opinions about using github but to try

583
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:35,159
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people to ask questions and talk</font>

584
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:37,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">about rules and such like that the the</font>

585
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,820
basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is this that there are some</font>

586
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:40,859
working groups that are heavily<font color="#E5E5E5"> reliant</font>

587
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,139
on github where they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing almost</font>

588
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:44,908
everything we github there are a bunch

589
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:47,668
of working groups where github is not

590
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:49,260
used at all and there's a bunch in the

591
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:51,900
middle where maybe one or two

592
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,150
documents is on github maybe it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

593
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,650
working group has a few documents on

594
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,900
github but maybe it's just the authors

595
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,060
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using github on their own and</font>

596
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,570
such like that there's a wide wide

597
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:06,899
variety of usages um and they're sort of

598
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:09,629
all valid but there are some problems

599
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the usages and so we had to pre</font>

600
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:15,510
sentation so i hope everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

601
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:17,160
looks at the presentations that were

602
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,110
given in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boov you know they're on</font>

603
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,120
there on the track<font color="#E5E5E5"> already one of them</font>

604
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">was by mark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nottingham which wasn't</font>

605
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,429
about github in specific it was about

606
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,199
working groups using tools and what are

607
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,630
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the requirements what do you</font>

608
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to get from them because every tool</font>

609
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:35,460
is there to make something<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and</font>

610
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,810
every tool that makes something better

611
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,970
make something worse and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hope that</font>

612
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:42,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an increase in</font>

613
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:45,510
one side or the other and github has a

614
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,850
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very sharp learning curve so it had</font>

615
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:50,820
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> also have a fairly sharp benefit</font>

616
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:53,250
curve as well and then second

617
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,500
presentation um well actually the first

618
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation was me where I did a roll</font>

619
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,720
call I had asked people on the mailing

620
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:02,580
list how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you using github so I did</font>

621
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,990
roll call so marks was the second

622
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,300
presentation third presentation was

623
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:09,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">Martin Thompson whose name I've spelled</font>

624
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:12,480
long now approximately half<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time on</font>

625
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:14,850
specifically about using github in

626
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,940
working groups uh and the interesting

627
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,709
thing there is that both mark and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin</font>

628
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,430
pretty much know each other through

629
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,900
github in HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> biss which is the one</font>

630
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,910
working group which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is using it all the</font>

631
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,610
time they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> their working group page</font>

632
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,470
they're very very heavy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know github</font>

633
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,780
commitment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yet the two of them</font>

634
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:38,070
disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a fair number of the usages</font>

635
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:40,110
so which again<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows that you know when</font>

636
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,810
we do tools not<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone likes the way</font>

637
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,429
we do tools and such like that um so

638
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,870
then there was a lot of open mic time

639
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,460
which actually went surprisingly well

640
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:51,449
given that this was a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pinyon</font>

641
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and this was about tools um so</font>

642
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:57,360
the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern that came up during</font>

643
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,860
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> my conversation if I can synthesize</font>

644
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,260
it because it came from many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people is</font>

645
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,560
this we have mailing lists currently

646
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,460
which

647
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:08,370
where we have discussion once you start

648
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,650
using github it adds not one but two

649
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,840
additional places where discussion might

650
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,910
happen for if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not familiar with</font>

651
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,370
github the easiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to know is</font>

652
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:20,490
github has its own issue tracker so just

653
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:22,139
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know pre github days when when</font>

654
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,810
working groups had their mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

655
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,300
and using tracking in the track trapper

656
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:29,070
from the tools team now there was two

657
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,230
places you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have and how do you</font>

658
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:34,830
coordinate them so this is a known

659
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:37,410
problem that preceded get up but github

660
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:39,780
has an additional place a very

661
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,520
attractive place for having conversation

662
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,590
which are pull request if you're not

663
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,920
familiar the pull request if you ever

664
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:49,260
told somebody online on send text pull

665
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,330
request is the easy way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send text</font>

666
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,980
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not easy to get the text</font>

667
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,919
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pull request but it makes a</font>

668
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:59,520
trivial for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> authors to accept the</font>

669
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:02,670
text but there is discussion in pull

670
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,970
requests as well so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say please</font>

671
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:09,300
change from 22 and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know do that as a</font>

672
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:11,430
pull request and anyone can comment on

673
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,710
that saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and even though it</font>

674
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,360
goes in the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> place where you want</font>

675
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,820
it in the draft and it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

676
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,649
the gifs someone can say you're being

677
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">Anglo centric we should actually use a</font>

678
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:24,240
different word no we shouldn't you're

679
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:26,610
just trolling you and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we have</font>

680
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,290
three places for conversation to happen

681
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,929
it and so the folks at the mic line were

682
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,120
the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> concern was how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

683
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,410
where to go look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation</font>

684
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,310
without having to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

685
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:41,250
plus are we losing some of the value of

686
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:43,200
having all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the conversation in the</font>

687
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:46,500
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can replay it easily</font>

688
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,720
meaning the mailing list so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

689
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,130
tools that might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used with</font>

690
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,720
that such but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really the big</font>

691
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:58,170
concern um the second biggest concern i

692
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,880
thought was um the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that because</font>

693
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:03,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learning curve for github and</font>

694
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,970
it's it's very non-trivial<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I mean if</font>

695
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,830
you're going to use github with get then

696
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,780
now you have two sharp learning curves

697
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:13,199
but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're using github without</font>

698
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,980
get the user interface is a little bit

699
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,470
daunting it was clearly written

700
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,590
or programming geeks which we are not

701
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:22,750
all programming geeks and in fact for

702
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,629
what we're using this for it's actually

703
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,040
for documentation as you're writing

704
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,140
documentation you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

705
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,110
concerns about collaboration than you do

706
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:35,470
when you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about programs you</font>

707
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:37,959
know uh typically so for those who don't

708
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,419
know get was developed for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux</font>

709
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,270
kernel in fact it was a hilarious tweet

710
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:44,950
this morning that says that github looks

711
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,490
like something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> designed by the</font>

712
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:50,919
guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who designed the Linux kernel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

713
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you know if you don't know it</font>

714
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:56,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're sort of keeping you out</font>

715
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:59,410
once you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> your on the inside um</font>

716
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:01,840
what this means is that in there there

717
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> class of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who understand</font>

718
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,010
github who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside the ITF I mean</font>

719
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,899
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an ietf tool it really is very</font>

720
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">popular in the programming world so</font>

721
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,859
there's a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> class of people who know</font>

722
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,830
it who<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have started coming into</font>

723
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:17,560
the IETF process because they search in

724
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,759
the github search thing for something

725
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,879
that they're doing especially if they're

726
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,190
programmed to something and they are not

727
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:26,049
our level of network programmers<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

728
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,639
there are network programmers they find

729
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,260
an internet draft that is something

730
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:32,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what they write they start reading</font>

731
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,639
and they go oh this is wrong because and

732
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:35,199
I know this is wrong because I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

733
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,389
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here now and</font>

734
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,850
they suggest text which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the normal</font>

735
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:41,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing to do and get up they suggest</font>

736
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:44,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Texas this is like the perfect thing</font>

737
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:46,389
these are the kind of people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want but</font>

738
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,960
by inviting those people in if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

739
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:52,210
becoming github centric we are also

740
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,679
estranging the old farts who think that

741
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,859
mailing lists are the right way to do

742
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,500
things and so there is somewhat of a

743
00:34:56,859 --> 00:35:02,290
culture clash it's not an either/or

744
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,850
thing but if we make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it not an either/or</font>

745
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:07,359
thing now we have multiple places to

746
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:09,790
discuss it so how you know can we use

747
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,880
github to bring in new people and to

748
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:15,490
make the current people more effective

749
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,380
or should we<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be using this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a tool</font>

750
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,029
so much and such like that so that was

751
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,190
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other my clients</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh so</font>

752
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,660
that's my summary of what happened it

753
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,280
was only an hour long<font color="#CCCCCC"> cough which is</font>

754
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,160
good it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working it is not a</font>

755
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,740
working group farming Boff

756
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,299
both mark and Martin's drafts may or may

757
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,089
not move forwards depending on if they

758
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:36,089
feel like it this isn't meant to be the

759
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:37,799
new process document because a lot of

760
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:39,029
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will prompt a lot of</font>

761
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:42,869
working groups will probably never use

762
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,849
github and some working groups will dive

763
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:46,380
in heavily it is really sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

764
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:50,490
orthogonal tool to the way we're

765
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:53,339
thinking but as working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups want to</font>

766
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,899
start using it how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage the</font>

767
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:57,240
knowledge of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other folks who are</font>

768
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,339
already using it such like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

769
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,529
assume i still have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> mike time yeah</font>

770
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">tiny bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great tiny bit please</font>

771
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:08,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright my ish so my question is is</font>

772
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:11,520
there any way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross post whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

773
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:14,099
happening in github<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the mailing</font>

774
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,140
list yes so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is yes but it</font>

775
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:20,089
needs additional tools some of which

776
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,089
have been written by people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF</font>

777
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:27,900
p resident lying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right and to</font>

778
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:30,538
follow up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just started</font>

779
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">using it for meeting venue and so i am</font>

780
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:33,809
getting a constant stream of nails for

781
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:36,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">the things I'm subscribe to so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see</font>

782
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:38,339
how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would go in that direction is</font>

783
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:41,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">there a way to go back the other way</font>

784
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:42,900
meaning if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> post to them if I reply to</font>

785
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:45,660
something on the mailing list it goes

786
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,180
back as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on the right thing I</font>

787
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,339
am in love there are tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

788
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:53,009
it's a smaller number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay can I um</font>

789
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:55,500
can I ask a favor instead of doing like

790
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:58,500
a tutorial or what I really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

791
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,240
about is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use it do we need</font>

792
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,150
tutorials going forward those kinds of

793
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:07,439
things as opposed to troubleshooting and

794
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:11,220
github problems Rick<font color="#CCCCCC"> Taylor my question</font>

795
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,670
isn't about github it's about github why

796
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:17,549
I I went to the bathroom is fascinating

797
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:20,640
some really good questions but should we

798
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:22,680
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at using a third-party up to</font>

799
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,000
host all this or<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we just look at the</font>

800
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,470
best practice that everyone loves the

801
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,049
get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say right great we've got</font>

802
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,598
track practice tickets track does get

803
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:32,369
integration<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I run it right when I</font>

804
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">come in you know why not why don't</font>

805
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:36,809
always host get and we can get some

806
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,369
extra stuff we're doing an ITF website

807
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:39,490
uplift perhaps you can get the web guys

808
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:42,190
to get

809
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:44,080
this basic stuff doesn't do it in-house

810
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,730
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay chance or that that goes back</font>

811
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to Mark's presentation on additional</font>

812
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:51,490
tools is have we sort of over magnified

813
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,840
on that one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean we can't</font>

814
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:55,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">have that discussion here but yes that</font>

815
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,550
that does there is that question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so</font>

816
00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:00,310
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question though of you</font>

817
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:02,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else is needed and such is</font>

818
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:05,259
there a feeling that tutorials are

819
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,640
needed or<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there a feeling that we</font>

820
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:11,890
have too many different levels at once

821
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,960
so anyways my client ah so Paul thank

822
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,600
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's good summary um I think I</font>

823
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,730
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add one value piece isn't in</font>

824
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tutorial and yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Evan just just</font>

825
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:23,160
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how it can add to the</font>

826
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:25,840
process my experience has been that

827
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,569
doing the document development in a

828
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,820
revision control system has immense

829
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,619
value when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the end of a</font>

830
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,780
complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> document really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like last</font>

831
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:37,300
call stage when new people come in and

832
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:40,240
they say what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about X what we've always</font>

833
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,560
done is somebody says we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

834
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that find it in the mailing archive</font>

835
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,270
somewhere and now you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the document</font>

836
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,830
you get blame you find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's change</font>

837
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:49,450
it and went in you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find an issue with</font>

838
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,119
the discussions ready just to that topic

839
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:53,589
and it's much more defensible process

840
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:56,880
and and how to check<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font>

841
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:59,170
assumptions one tiny little how to niche

842
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,000
really commonly these documents are just

843
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,230
in markdown and you can just make

844
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,060
suggestions right through the github

845
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,380
interface you click the edit button and

846
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,750
people do make typos<font color="#CCCCCC"> Corrections and</font>

847
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,930
send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> off it's really easy peasy yep</font>

848
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,160
um so just just as a note I'd we have

849
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,399
about three minutes left for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

850
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:20,670
conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> so very concise I would</font>

851
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:24,100
love more tutorials<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how to use Travis</font>

852
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:27,040
circle now to build and also the beauty

853
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:30,310
that HTTP base has on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> github with</font>

854
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> getup pages it's beautiful about</font>

855
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:37,000
hard to build yep sure um yeah I did a

856
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:39,609
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> github in w3c and it</font>

857
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
worked so fantastically I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

858
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:44,740
problems but it's it really barley

859
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,420
improves what you're doing and to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

860
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,189
Patrick's points with regards to

861
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,020
tutorials or second that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Travis</font>

862
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,460
stuff would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great but just a little</font>

863
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of process for some new chairs</font>

864
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,530
getting started

865
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:57,140
I think was richard barnes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> martin</font>

866
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:59,599
Thompson did a thing a while ago and I

867
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:02,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked them after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that about how to make</font>

868
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,040
what to name our repo and you know Pat

869
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:07,040
what processes shall i do should i do

870
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,080
one repo for the whole what a thing or a

871
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,430
town or an organization and so those

872
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,840
kind of things would be great<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

873
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,490
one of the one of the outcomes of that

874
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,660
particular one<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i chaired that oh</font>

875
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:19,700
yeah was um the question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

876
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:22,069
guidance to give people versus do we

877
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:24,169
need not necessarily process but do we

878
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,820
need and you know do we need certain

879
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,770
structures or certain rules for how

880
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">people use a github to do I ETF stuff</font>

881
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:31,220
and that was left as an open question

882
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,869
then and I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it's still sort of</font>

883
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,399
an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> question up so I know some</font>

884
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:36,560
people feel like this processes might

885
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,210
limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things I would as a newer</font>

887
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:43,400
processes it won't matter old old chair

889
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,280
say this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you should name your</font>

890
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,170
organization these are the people it

things just for people to get started<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

893
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,520
how do you set it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in such a way that</font>

894
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:54,560
you guarantee the transparency that we

00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,080
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure continues without hm yeah</font>

896
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,279
yeah yeah anyway I'm violating my own

897
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:04,190
stuff Isis so Ron<font color="#CCCCCC"> gondwana I just wanted</font>

898
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,990
to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess counter the idea of ITF</font>

899
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,109
running their own git repository our own

900
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:10,939
git repository and own tooling around it

901
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:12,589
it's very insular compared to being on

902
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,550
github where other people can discover

903
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:15,109
it when we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

904
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:17,510
website being discoverable people

905
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:19,369
outside the ITF if we're using all

906
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,170
in-house tooling it's a lot harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

907
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:23,869
people in other communities to discover

908
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:25,940
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and I know you're going to</font>

909
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:26,839
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so go ahead I don't have an</font>

910
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,030
answer for that I just have a

911
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:30,650
counterproposal are we going to do a

912
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:34,310
nice tutorial on how<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups</font>

913
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:35,660
should use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook it's the same thing</font>

914
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:38,060
I mean github is a third-party

915
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,980
organization where how does this work

916
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,660
legally I said when there's miss you I

917
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,369
love because there's a good question on

918
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,080
there follow mark<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nottingham's document</font>

919
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:47,119
because that is the bigger picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

920
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,980
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just feel there's a lot</font>

921
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,570
of enthusiasm and I can see why<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

922
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,859
this great tooling right there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

923
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,089
of good reason but I just want to kind

924
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:54,319
of pull the reins a little bit say I

925
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:55,549
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this right</font>

926
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,200
more so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been plenty reigns</font>

927
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:59,839
polling as well the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

928
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,640
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to emphasize on this is that</font>

929
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,089
the reason we're doing this is to make

930
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,799
our document processing better and there

931
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:09,170
are a wide variety

932
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:10,219
of beliefs in how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens I mean</font>

933
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:14,179
Patrick brought up a real interesting

934
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">point which is if you ignored github the</font>

935
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:17,630
way we've been doing in the past has

936
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,699
worked for some things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it failed for</font>

937
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,019
others maybe github fixes some of those

938
00:42:19,699 --> 00:42:24,650
or not but we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the big</font>

939
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:28,399
picture so right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you all I'd</font>

940
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,539
also encourage this conversation to

941
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,849
continue on the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group chairs</font>

942
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:33,259
mailing list so we're going to move

943
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,699
really quickly through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next two</font>

944
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,839
pieces of the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> which was to talk</font>

945
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:38,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some of the education and</font>

946
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:47,058
mentoring activities and also to talk

947
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:53,839
about the newcomer stuff so well you

948
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:55,489
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the didn't anyway sorry so we do</font>

949
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,078
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a education and mentoring</font>

951
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:04,400
the this all went out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the note so</font>

952
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,749
that you can read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the key thing</font>

953
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,699
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to talk about today is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are a number of different</font>

projects at this entails and a lot of

956
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:15,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">this has to do with projects that are</font>

957
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:17,179
ongoing and already well underway the

excellent tutorials and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:33,739
can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> use suggestions for new</font>

00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:36,558
tutorials<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think about a year ago</font>

967
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:38,119
Benoit in particular was telling us<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

968
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to do a better job of focusing on</font>

969
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,140
the technologies of the IETF is

970
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:43,910
developing I think the DNS privacy and

971
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,788
quick tutorials both had excellent

972
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:49,759
turnouts and I think that's a

973
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:52,429
reinforcement of the point there also be

974

on we there's a number of there's some

about about the IETF and things like

that some of that that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

volunteers to discuss to lead

00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,859
currently calling newcomers outreach and

999
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:46,670
this is things like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> newcomers meet</font>

1000
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:50,119
and greet and also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Secretariat does</font>

1001
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:53,660
a dinner for newcomers we have to

1002
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:55,250
mentoring programs right now we have the

1003
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,250
speed mentoring which if you haven't

1004
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:01,510
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I would strongly encourage you</font>

1005
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:03,530
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only an hour and it's not as as</font>

1006
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,640
painful as I originally imagined it

1007
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:08,510
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it's actually quite interesting</font>

1008
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:12,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I did talk a former</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF earth at</font>

1009
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:14,080
current IHF for a long time a friend of

1010
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:16,970
mine into doing this and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> said it was</font>

1011
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,850
about thirty three percent awkward and

1012
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:22,819
sixty-six percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so and he's a</font>

1013
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:24,950
pretty shy guy so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works much</font>

1014
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:28,640
better than I ever ever imagined that it

1015
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:31,279
would and it gives newcomers a chance to

1016
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,720
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few faces and then we had the</font>

1017
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,980
regular mentoring program the numbers

1018
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had been going up and you've</font>

1019
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:40,430
been seeing a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of requests from</font>

1022
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,629

high teens last time and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1024
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:52,600
objectives is to do a little bit better

1025
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:54,890
job of reporting out some metrics on

1026
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:58,850
what all of these various<font color="#E5E5E5"> programs are</font>

1027
00:45:54,890 --> 00:46:00,890
and how they're reaching people there is

1028
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:02,569
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a number there's a lot of</font>

1029
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:05,299
activity if you're following<font color="#CCCCCC"> the V Meath</font>

1030
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:07,000
mailing list there's a bunch of activity

1031
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,250
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> remote hubs and community hubs</font>

1032
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,510
and those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of activities and the</font>

1033
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,810
final went on there is this assessment

1034
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:16,280
metrics and measurement not talking

1035
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,720
about a heavyweight metrics but

1036
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,730
sometimes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to judge</font>

1037
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,799
whether what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're I mean everybody</font>

1038
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,560
lives in a world of limited resources we

1039
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,580
need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to judge whether the</font>

1040
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,109
programs that we're doing are effective

1041
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:30,500
or not so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're not effective</font>

1042
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:33,339
we can modify them in such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that we</font>

1043
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually try to achieve our results</font>

1044
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:37,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">ICP coming to the microphone so that's</font>

1045
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:39,380
the end of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overview</font>

1046
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:44,179
of education and mentoring Directorate

1047
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:46,459
and Pete yeah so I got roped into the

1048
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:48,319
speed mentoring this time and I agree

1049
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:50,448
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the assessment of it was probably</font>

1050
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-thirds really good and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one-third</font>

1051
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:56,989
strangely awkward but um I found the

1052
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:59,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">newcomers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet and greet not terribly</font>

1053
00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:01,969
effective in part because newcomers tend

1054
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:06,259
to wander aimlessly and in part because

1055
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:08,959
us old fogies tend to drink among

1056
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:11,509
ourselves the<font color="#E5E5E5"> joy the amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drinking</font>

1057
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:14,689
is neither here nor there but that we

1058
00:47:11,509 --> 00:47:17,419
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each other which is to</font>

1059
00:47:14,689 --> 00:47:21,469
be expected some way to hook those two

1060
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:24,259
events together um and maybe sort of the

1061
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:27,439
nice thing about the speed mentoring was

1062
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:30,559
it forced us old fogies to talk to some

1063
00:47:27,439 --> 00:47:33,529
of the newcomers immediately in a very

1064
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,619
controlled context and having that slide

1065
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:41,509
into a more general social thing might

1066
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:43,579
make both more effective so you actually

1067
00:47:41,509 --> 00:47:46,819
sort of did a foreshadowing of my next

1068
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:48,829
set<font color="#E5E5E5"> of conversations which was okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1069
00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:50,359
just gave you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really high</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level</font>

1070
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:51,650
snapshot of what the education<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1071
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:53,029
mentoring activities are and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1072
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:54,890
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused at newcomers and some</font>

1073
00:47:53,029 --> 00:47:56,209
of them are not so now what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1074
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">is take a quick thread through what the</font>

1075
00:47:56,209 --> 00:48:00,769
newcomer efforts are and i also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1076
00:47:58,339 --> 00:48:02,299
want us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about what are our true</font>

1077
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:04,158
object what our objectives here what are

1078
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:05,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">we trying to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> newcomers</font>

1079
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,069
and we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that in a minute but</font>

1080
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:09,039
first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of step through</font>

1081
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:11,509
what the newcomer related activities are

1082
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:14,299
so first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all there's the website the</font>

1083
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:15,829
online information how does somebody who

1084
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:17,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows nothing about the ietf that plans</font>

1085
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:19,819
to come get the information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1086
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:21,348
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a lot of the improvements</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1087
00:48:19,819 --> 00:48:23,959
will come through the result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1088
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:25,699
website redesign the next thing that

1089
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:27,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">they get is a newcomer email from the</font>

1090
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:28,699
secretary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the newcomer email from</font>

1091
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:30,019
the secretary it gives them pointers to

1092
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,999
a number of things including things like

1093
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:34,399
the mentoring program and tell somewhere

1094
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:36,348
to sign up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those kinds of things so</font>

1095
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,939
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing that Newt that</font>

1096
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:40,039
impacts newcomers is the mentoring

1097
00:48:37,939 --> 00:48:43,069
program and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one where you</font>

1098
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:44,559
actually sign up you identify what

1099
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:46,449
you're interested in and

1100
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:49,359
the mentoring coordinators match you

1101
00:48:46,449 --> 00:48:51,160
with which match you with somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1102
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:54,098
the IHF community who has similar

1103
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,019
interests and you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop you know</font>

1104
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:57,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may just exchange one or two emails</font>

1105
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:59,859
or have a conversation or you may

1106
00:48:57,489 --> 00:49:02,559
develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much deeper you know</font>

1107
00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:04,299
relationship in the sense that in a more

1108
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,949
traditional mentor type of relationship

1109
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:07,630
so the nature of those relationships

1110
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:10,959
vary depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pair of</font>

1111
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:12,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">people you're talking about the next</font>

1112
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:14,019
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they would hit would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

1113
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:15,910
newcomers tutorial which mike st.<font color="#E5E5E5"> John's</font>

1114
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:18,939
has been doing for the last couple I

1115
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:23,140
chest and a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice job on that the</font>

1116
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:25,239
tutorial is a has been recast a bit it's

1117
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,578
shorter than it used to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's it's</font>

1118
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:28,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">really more about pointing you to where</font>

1119
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:30,789
you need to find the things that you

1120
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:33,160
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's less about that the</font>

1121
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:35,229
long history of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF that material</font>

1122
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,819
is still all there but but the the way

1123
00:49:35,229 --> 00:49:38,439
the newcomers tutorial is currently

1124
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:41,140
being defined is slightly different than

1125
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:43,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have the speed mentoring</font>

1126
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,459
which we've already we were talking

1127
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:47,558
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit and that the real</font>

1128
00:49:45,459 --> 00:49:49,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">objective of this is is not so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much to</font>

1129
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:51,609
match people with other people

1130
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:53,049
specifically related on interests or

1131
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:55,479
working groups but basically to get

1132
00:49:53,049 --> 00:49:57,369
folks talking to people in the IETF and

1133
00:49:55,479 --> 00:49:59,379
and occasionally you'll make interesting

1134
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,699
connections I know I've heard a couple

1135
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,349
stories from people this week who are

1136
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:04,599
very excited about being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect</font>

1137
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:07,170
person a two-person be based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1138
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:09,699
conversation they had in speed mentoring

1139
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,329
so then the question that newcomers meet

1140
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:14,410
and greet is next and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Pete</font>

1141
00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:16,390
completely teed up the conversation

1142
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> newcomers meeting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> greed we were</font>

1143
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:19,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">having a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation about whether this</font>

1144
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">is really a useful event or not or is it</font>

1145
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:26,140
really more a working group chair social

1146
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:29,439
and so the witch<font color="#E5E5E5"> which has valid and you</font>

1147
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:31,029
know a valid purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did also hear</font>

1148
00:50:29,439 --> 00:50:32,499
somebody say something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

1149
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:33,699
know refilling their glass of wine when

1150
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:35,019
it was free before they went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1151
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:36,400
regular reception where they had to pay

1152
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:40,569
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> their wine so that that's another</font>

1153
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,160
strategy for that but so we were going

1154
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:43,569
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forth on what's the purpose of</font>

1155
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,249
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> newcomers meet greet and is it</font>

1156
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:48,579
effective and is it meeting that purpose

1157
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:50,618
or not and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pieces of feedback</font>

1158
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:52,239
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did get which because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

1159
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:53,650
leaning towards the this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1160
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:55,029
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective and the speed mentoring</font>

1161
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,190
is doing more of what we actually want

1162
00:50:55,029 --> 00:50:59,609
to do there

1163
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:02,339
the newcomers make great the speed

1164
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:04,799
mentoring is more about meeting in you

1165
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:07,109
know various random individuals whereas

1166
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,210
the newcomers make great is provided

1167
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:10,980
that you have the structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the you</font>

1168
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:12,450
know you will reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and do this you</font>

1173
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:24,359
that context whereas you can't expect

1174
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,369
all of the working group chairs and and

1175

00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,799
you know do your own thing if you want

00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,629
to come kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing so those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1185
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,170
the current newcomers efforts so

1186
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what's the point you know what</font>

1187
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:52,500
are the eject what are our objectives

1188
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,970
for facilitating newcomers do want to

1189
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,010
increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of drafts you know</font>

1190
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we you know you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1191
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,230
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just decrease the number of</font>

1192
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,609
drafts you want to increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font>

1193
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,930
kinds of drafts that are addressing the

1194
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:03,750
problems we're trying to solve so you

1195
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:05,190
want you know you how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you measure</font>

1196
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,619
whether that is a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a bad</font>

1197
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:09,210
thing increased volunteers prescribing

1198
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:10,770
reviewing editing those kinds of things

1199
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:13,319
increased participation in working

1200
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:17,550
groups and increased attendance from you

1201
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:19,980
know for revenue so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question for you</font>

1202
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:21,180
all and given that it's 1246 and we have

1203
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:24,300
about four minutes for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conversation</font>

1204
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:25,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what are some of the metrics for</font>

1205
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:29,520
measuring how effective newcomer efforts

1206
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,589
are and also we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> very focused on</font>

1207
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,390
the the newcomer activities thus far in

1208
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:34,890
in making the newcomers happy and

1209
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,990
meeting their needs and so my question

1210
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:39,359
to the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your chairs is what do</font>

1211
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:41,009
you all need from newcomers or you know

1212
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:43,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">what do you wish they knew that they</font>

1213
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:44,490
don't know or what do you wish you know

1214
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,050
how could we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the newcomers that</font>

1215
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:50,250
intersect with your working groups more

1216
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:53,490
effective and there you have it Hoffman

1217
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:56,700
I want to go off slide here um is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1218
00:52:53,490 --> 00:53:00,000
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort to ask people who came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to one</font>

1219
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:02,310
IETF and don't come to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one or</font>

1220
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,050
don't come to one for a year why didn't

1221
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:06,810
they and the reason I'm asking is is

1222
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:09,240
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the newcomers meet and</font>

1223
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:09,960
greet works I've had newcomers be very

1224
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,529
happy about it

1225
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,750
such like that and i think that overall

1226
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:18,119
and by the way i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly reverse</font>

1227
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:19,980
your list here increasing attendance and

1228
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,020
participation is way more important

1229
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:25,170
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> these people to be involved do</font>

1230
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:29,820
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have do we ever ask about why</font>

1231
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:32,760
didn't you stay involved so so what we

1232
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,170
have started doing it we first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we</font>

1233
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,000
expanded the definition of newcomers

1234
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:39,960
from one time meeting to five meetings

1235
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,270
and we we have sent out in previous ones

1236
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,790
we've sent out various types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> surveys</font>

1237
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:50,520
what we've done this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and last time</font>

1238
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:51,990
is surveys to we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically incorporated</font>

1239
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,849
the newcomers portion into the main

1240
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,740
survey and then we asked them which

1241
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:57,750
activities they were interested in the

1242
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:00,000
next step<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us is to take a look back</font>

1243
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:02,040
at how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many you know how many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1244
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,270
newcomers are staying and what are they

1245
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,890
doing and we don't we haven't actually

1246
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:07,140
pulled that data together yet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

1247
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:08,609
spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time talking about but</font>

1248
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:11,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">also we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spent a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of times I've got it</font>

1249
00:54:08,609 --> 00:54:15,180
we we really think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to take a</font>

1250
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:19,700
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular aspect go ahead</font>

1251
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:23,940
p not Pete hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is no not that yes</font>

1252
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:25,348
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barry that 2 comments one is</font>

1253
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,660
about the new comers meet and greet I

1254
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:29,099
agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carly I think it's effective</font>

1255
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,649
but i think what matters is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1256
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:33,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">newcomers think that but I've certainly</font>

1257
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:36,630
talked with lots of newcomers at this

1258
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:38,700
one and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them and and I've</font>

1259
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:40,589
introduced them to the working group

1260
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,879
chairs and area directors that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

1261
00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:44,070
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in seeing and that sort of</font>

1262
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,950
thing what I find the trouble with it is

1263
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:50,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's always way too crowded to move</font>

1264
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:53,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">around and often way too noisy to talk</font>

1265
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,930
and I had a thought I don't know what

1266
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:57,630
the logistics would be but we should

1267
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:59,160
look at the possibility of having most

1268
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:02,070
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> welcome reception</font>

1269
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,410
done earlier and see if we can have the

1270
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:06,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">meet and greet in that room and transit</font>

1271
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:07,710
out I<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1272
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,689
a problem that we have struggled with

1273
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a while and we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about it</font>

1274
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">further right now but we only have two</font>
