38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,660
last call jumping ahead for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">one speaking quickly on the XMPP not as</font>

40
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,950
the chair I still other than Chris's

41
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,410
feedback haven't gotten anything so when

42
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:10,880
Kathleen comes back we'll ask because

43
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:13,840
it's been on last call so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,760
two remaining transport drafts um

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,640
there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more draft I think on the</font>

46
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">guideline right because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other one</font>

47
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,859
has RF seen the application

48
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,010
implementation so we basically have

49
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:32,060
three things<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> home</font>

50
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:33,890
stretch<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a mile maybe yeah um and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

51
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,780
with that let's go ahead and do the

52
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:41,209
update so should we um oh let's should

53
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,460
we do the milestones real quick yeah I

54
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:47,150
think I kind of covered this real quick

55
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:51,320
um so we had targeted to do the working

56
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,260
last call for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidance and the rolly</font>

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,239
and I think we did for both but we were

58
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,209
expecting more feedback and an update

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,100
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly as well as the guidance</font>

60
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,280
which we now are going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> updates</font>

61
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,549
for um<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have not gotten any feedback</font>

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:12,230
for the XMPP so I don't know if that's

63
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:15,770
good or bad and then we're targeting to

64
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:20,510
do another working group last call for

65
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:23,840
the sea cert draft in I guess the next

66
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,340
six months right<font color="#E5E5E5"> bye-bye the ITF I mean</font>

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,950
if we can get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sooner that would be</font>

68
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,810
great but<font color="#CCCCCC"> those are the current targets</font>

69
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,180
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're on target for our</font>

70
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:36,590
milestones for these current mile steps

71
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:39,850
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um let's go</font>

72
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,849
ahead and have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steven</font>

77
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:03,440
with it the pink box I'm in trouble

78
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,760
because there's no pink box um the

79
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,530

86
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,530
that we made since<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last version that</font>

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,090
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented at the last hi ETF meeting</font>

88
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:30,440
there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been no new major changes the</font>

89
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,000
changes that we made were the ones that

90
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,810
were decided on at Mile in Korea so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,300
implemented those changes that were

92
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,070
decided on we made a few minor fixes

93
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,290
throughout the document and those

94
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,300
changes all together constitute the 06

95
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,770
version so we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

96
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,750
go through really quick talk about the

97
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes try and figure out what all</font>

98
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,840
changed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can pin down all of that</font>

99
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,859
so the first major change that'll be

100
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,260
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I just go through slides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

101
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">you next slide please so the first</font>

102
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,330
change was adding the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly property</font>

103
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,679
element this was issue number 51 on the

104
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,830
github for anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> following along</font>

105
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,340
there and again this was decided on at

106
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:13,070
the last IETF we added a new element to

107
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,969
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly schema and defined it in the</font>

108
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,140
document called Rollie property

109
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,210
properties are registered and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

110
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,490
table that we have established in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

111
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,380
main document and extension documents

112
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,090
may register new properties into this

113
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,500
table so every time you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add new</font>

114
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,530
properties doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,760
publish a new document that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

116
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,270
properties registered in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye on a</font>

117
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,789
table these properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> are for arbitrary</font>

118
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,130
exposure of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

119
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,140
the content for example if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">io def document and you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

121
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,280
to expose the ID of that I oh def

122
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,300
documents that it's easier to search so

123
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,400
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody doesn't have to download</font>

124
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,850
the entire I<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh def document in order to</font>

125
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,760
get the ID the person the the publisher

00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,289
of that entry may do rowley property and

127
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,808

iof ID in that property<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that is the</font>

129
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:03,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">purpose of the property element in order</font>

130
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:07,460
to expose arbitrary data for better

131
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:09,409
identification and categorization this

132
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,719
is all explained more in the document as

133
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:15,199

dereferencing this URL results in that

161
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:30,740
to standards track there were three

groups indicating support for

consistent and as clear as possible we

169

the document to make sure everything was

we already decided in Korea so<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

189
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,330
being said all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the major work as far</font>

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rolly we believe that this document</font>

194

group last call a long time ago it has

195
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,930
gone through several major revisions

196
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,490
since then we believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rollie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

197
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,010
ready for a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group last call to</font>

198
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,340
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> restarted in order to get review on</font>

199
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:03,480
the new major revisions of the document

200
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:05,040
so for the myself and Dave the primary

201
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,290
co-authors at the moment we believe that

202
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group last call's is the next</font>

203
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,770
step for Rowley obviously it's a

204
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:15,240
discussion to have here in the working

205
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:17,490
group but next slide the current

206
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,370
extensions that are out there is the sea

207
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,660
cert draft in this working group and the

208
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:26,490
software descriptor<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft in sockem</font>

209
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,990
those extensions still need review from

210
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,630
people that are knowledgeable in those

211
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,520
particular areas especially with the

212
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,920
inclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the new Rollie property</font>

213
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:39,210
element subject matter experts can

214
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,189
provide feedback as to which properties

215
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,970
are particularly valuable to register

216
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:46,380
for exposure so if you are an expert in

217
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,760
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of software descriptor formats</font>

218
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:53,450
such as swig or if you're an expert in

219
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">io</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deaf or any other incident indicator</font>

220
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,950
formats then your feedback would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

221
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:02,670
greatly<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciated on these extension</font>

222
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:04,320
documents we're also beginning the

223
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,569
process of planning out additional

224
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,970
extension documents where those will be

<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure but we're looking at</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">lists as well as one for vulnerabilities</font>

228
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,490
and definitely very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that that is something that</font>

230
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,320
needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get done so if you're</font>

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in that you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> contact the</font>

authors

233
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,920
we'll be happy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you write those</font>

234
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,560
extension documents in order to plan out

235
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,170
what you need to do good Adam on Phyllis

236
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,770
ers and where we already have checklists

237
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:37,209
kind of almost ready to submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

238
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,189
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably end up working on</font>

239
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,900
vulnerabilities also<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome that's</font>

240
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,750
great news so it's really good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear</font>

241
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,850
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other things that you are</font>

242
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in creating more information</font>

243
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,500
types for Rowley that are relevant to

244
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,300
your use cases you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> either write the</font>

245
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,560
extension yourself or if you contact the

246
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,599
authors will be happy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you a</font>

247
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,369
couple pointers you can also reference

248
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,280
the existing extension documents in

249
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,570
order to get a template for some some

250
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,140
examples of how to write a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly</font>

251
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,580
extension document so the more well

252
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,740
formatted extensions that are out there

253
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,120
the more information types really can

254
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,450
cover and the better it is for everybody

255
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,810
so please feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

256
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,060
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that um don't think</font>

257
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,339
that next slide there's no is it that's

258
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,099
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I'm not sure how we're doing</font>

259
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,440
on time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't have anything else</font>

260
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,900
to talk about I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open the floor</font>

261
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,160
to questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and comments I'm sure we</font>

262
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:37,600
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of time to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

263
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regarding the location</font>

264
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,190
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service document huh I was so I</font>

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,830
was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to attend the song meetings</font>

266
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,280
so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure but I understood</font>

267
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:50,050
correctly normally the location of the

268
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">service dog named could be described</font>

269
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:57,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a hit the field of the HTML either</font>

270
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:59,880
correct you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking if the service</font>

271
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:04,440
document locations described in the HTML

272
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:07,030
report was that HD technol is a correct

273
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:11,710
so in this case the question is if the

274
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:15,040
location contradicts with your location

275
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,900
how shall we resolve me to describe that

276
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,270
the document right that would be that

277
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,069
would be a good addition to clarify as

278
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:25,870
far as the requirements in the document

279
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:28,450
stand now that location of the service

280
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,210
document can redirect to that other

281
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,550
location the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement is</font>

282
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,460
that that particular URL when you send a

283
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,760
restful get request to that URL it can

284
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,500
reach

285
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,080
correct as long as it resolves the

286
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,810
service document I don't know if that

287
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,720
answered your question Dave Dave

288
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:49,569
altameyer um so so I think we're talking

289
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,480
about two different paths of discovery

290
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:54,760
so and they're both talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

291
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,530
document the the first that hockey was

292
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:01,210
talking about was if a home<font color="#E5E5E5"> page you</font>

293
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:06,089
know for an organization they include a

294
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:08,560
link element in the in the HTML head

295
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,900
that that link could actually point to

296
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,069
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly services and that's</font>

297
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:17,350
certainly one way of actually

298
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:19,750
identifying a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly service the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

299
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">other way is is the the other way that</font>

300
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:25,720
we've we've introduced through the URL

301
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:29,949
template as a way to identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly</font>

302
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,950
service and we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both are</font>

303
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:35,320
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm having the ability to use the</font>

304
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,230
URL template means that all you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

305
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,870
know is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server that is providing the</font>

306
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">rolly service and you can then discover</font>

307
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,760
all of the collections of information

308
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,590
you know that are available given you

309
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,710
know how you're authenticated and

310
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:53,050
authorized on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that server and that's</font>

311
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:55,060
actually extremely valuable and in our

312
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,949
opinion to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do that without</font>

313
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,069
having to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other</font>

314
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:02,530
services now 11 usage example could be

315
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,300
using a service record to point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

316
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">rolly service you know you can look it</font>

317
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,410
up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS go straight to it start to</font>

318
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,150
enumerate the collections and you're off

319
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,150
and running so that's something that we

320
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,530
also wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

321
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,780
you're free to use any number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

322
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:19,120
discovery mechanisms we just required

323
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,920
one such that there's always a mandatory

324
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,660
option in order for discovery to happen

325
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:30,040
thank you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if the</font>

326
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:34,060
location pointed by your scheme and

327
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:37,360
quantified a header field of HTML is not

328
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:41,829
the same which one<font color="#CCCCCC"> shall we trust maybe</font>

329
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,950
we have to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> down about it so if</font>

330
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,690
they contradict I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would follow</font>

331
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,680
the requirements of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolly document</font>

332
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,470
and say that the one that resolves

333
00:15:48,680 --> 00:16:00,380
URL template is the normative service

334
00:15:51,470 --> 00:16:03,730
document ok any other general general

335
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:12,110
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> rowley comments on anything</font>

336
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:14,870
happy to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it ok so on the</font>

337
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:18,230
topic of last call turn that to the

338
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:20,060
chairs yeah so um given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there were</font>

339
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,390
significant changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it would be</font>

340
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:28,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">worth it um so question for the group</font>

341
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:33,160
who has read the latest draft halfway

342
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:35,870
okay so so maybe what I'll do not maybe

343
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:40,610
what we'll do is I'll send out another

344
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:42,620
email to the group to get reviews can I

345
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,800
get at least a couple people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to commit</font>

346
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:53,600

355
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:24,109
30 day last call and then depending on

356
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,780
the feedback I'll either do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shepherd</font>

357
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:29,540
and move it forward or request for more

361
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,540
you had talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> dessert um so we</font>

362
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,939
have not published an update to the sea

363
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,629
sir document since Korea so it's still

364
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:50,900
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 00 we're still working on it and</font>

365
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:53,660
I am confident that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a 0 1</font>

366
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,030
perhaps a no to depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how fast we</font>

367
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,380
kind of iterate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the changes it</font>

368
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,080
regardless we'll have an update for the

369
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,809
next IETF com have a presentation then

370
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,080
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changes the document</font>

371
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:06,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font>

372
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,779
is fairly fleshed out there definitely

373
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,029
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a couple passes of content</font>

374
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:14,000
and polish we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see done on it</font>

375
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:16,130
before it gets put but at that point

376
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,710
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could talk about adoption</font>

377
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,720
updates updates an adoption yeah Dave

378
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,429
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Dave Walter Meyer most of the</font>

379
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,549
updates are like making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that things</font>

380
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:27,289
are in sync with the court rolling now

381
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:30,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we've made some changes</font>

382
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:33,379
there yep examples probably need it a

383
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,000
little bit of work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be updated you</font>

384
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,889
know some minor minor things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

385
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,799
so there's not a lot of work to do there

386
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:41,840
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of consistency check yeah it</font>

387
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,730
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to line with the updated right</font>

388
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,049
back right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the one of</font>

389
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,809
the big things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see is if</font>

446
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:53,730
call for both the guidance draft and the

447
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">rolly we had put out a call for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XMPP</font>

448
00:22:53,730 --> 00:23:00,150
draft but we haven't gotten any other

449
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:04,110
than Chris you reviewed it and found it

450
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I haven't changed the draft on so</font>

451
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,879
Kathleen this is a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the ad</font>

452
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,429
given that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've not had any feedback</font>

453
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,670
how do we proceed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the XMPP draft</font>

454
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:18,080
we've received Chris and there was

455
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,080
somebody else I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember who loves</font>

456
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:35,960
yep I think it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the one</font>

457
00:23:47,190 --> 00:24:16,750
no this is XMPP grid yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

458
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:19,600
extended i used a blast off<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and it</font>

459
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:25,240
gets wider community and click on that

460
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:30,629
and add some sad<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> skip over</font>

461
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:33,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I right to be and down</font>

462
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,660
the capillary I'd like to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

463
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:39,129
reviews on it I thought we would have

464
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:41,530
had more reviews from across the area so

465
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,450
I guess we could do one of two things I

466
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,800
could do an extended<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF last call or</font>

467
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:48,570
we could do another working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group last</font>

468
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,680
call where we reach out to sag do we

469
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,510
this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one we're here we don't</font>

470
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if they'll be significant changes</font>

471
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,490
requested right how many implementations

472
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,580
separate implementations are there

473
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:03,640
there's quite a few separate

474
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,530
implementations separate implementations

475
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,890
I know yet the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> base that's using</font>

476
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:14,500
yeah so then there's one on server but

477
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:21,580
there's over 20 clients so it's also

478
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:25,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay being discussed in the Oasis sticks</font>

479
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:28,030
and taxi I don't know if you want to do

480
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,070
a cross because we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> different anyone</font>

481
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,570
can participate me IETF so they want to

482
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,530
just get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list and provide</font>

483
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:37,419
feedback they can do that so I could ask

484
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:40,410
Richard we could do a formal liaison to

485
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,410
them too if you'd like

486
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,620
so then if we're going to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

487
00:25:50,290 --> 00:26:00,639
