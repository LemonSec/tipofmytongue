00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:37,020
only one implementation report was added

would anyone like to bash this agenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

I<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as no let's proceed forward</font>

23
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,439
before we do that just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,490
together last in IDF 97 we had a virtual

27
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:56,159
interim in February we also had a design

<font color="#E5E5E5">some time on the agenda to talk about</font>

35
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:15,689
that later there are also a couple

<font color="#CCCCCC">updates in the individual drafts we're</font>

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IM DM with regards to the status</font>

43
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,730
of the solutions it's actually hard to

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,260
see there in the graphic but we've we've

45
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,600
had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of updates that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

46
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,359
reflected there in green but in the case

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the bottom three documents the</font>

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,110
authors on that draft have said for the

49
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,090
time being they're going to pause

50
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,940
progress on these drafts and put their

51
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,220
energy into those top two drafts and we

52
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,300
can further this conversation when we

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,070
talk about the solutions we'll talk a

54
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,900
little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about milestones after</font>

55
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,019
we wrap up on the drafts but I throw

56
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,060
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are behind</font>

57
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,040
we need to revise those milestones<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

58
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,050
reflect reality and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

59
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,970
really pressing forward with ours with

60
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,680
our solutions kind of drafts and we can

61
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about how to do that specifically</font>

62
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,390
again after we hear the presentations so

63
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,310
to the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> first up for us is Roland</font>

64
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:31,738
who's going to be talking about our use

65
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:36,230
cases so we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> clicking in one</font>

66
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:42,870
moment hi I'm Roland Evans over<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks</font>

67
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:45,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the cliff he is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working I'm not</font>

68
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,910
smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to unit here we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

69
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,580
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go so um first of all thanks</font>

70
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:54,600
very much to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Daniel will go on in Frank</font>

71
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">John who pushed this update out with the</font>

72
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,850
04 draft of use cases the structure has

73
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,399
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplified so a lot of the stuff</font>

74
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the appendices um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leading</font>

75
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,610
unnecessary and has been dropped we've

76
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,190
added an orchestration section not

77
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:15,120
because dots is vital to the operation

78
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,100
of orchestrators but to provide use

79
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,340
cases a use case at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> one escapes</font>

80
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,890
that shows how a denouncement agaciro

81
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,650
frustration system would interact with

82
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,510
external entities via dots and what

83
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">effect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different dots messages you would</font>

84
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,710
have on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the actions of your</font>

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,080
frustration system takes

86
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,310
in order to successfully mitigate DDoS

87
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks so that's actually a pretty</font>

88
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:41,400
lengthy section that is an added there's

89
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,640
also a new intra-organizational use case

90
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,750
this is actually I'm having to do with a

91
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,390
broadband access ISP who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> protecting</font>

92
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,970
their customers against ddos attack

93
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,909
scene and and how the use of dots would

94
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,580
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> place between their customers in</font>

95
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,160
their actual orchestration system and

96
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,530
detox communication systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though</font>

97
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,210
the end customers themselves are

98
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,400
actually you know what are there

99
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,930
individuals their small home offices

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,880
what have you there different entities

101
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,490
this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> considered an intra</font>

102
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,480
organizational use case because the

103
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,770
broadband access<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP operate the entire</font>

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,840
network infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> here it's not as</font>

105
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,000
if this is in like an enterprise who

106
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,250
operate their own network infrastructure

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,560
and have their own distinct transit edge

108
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,240
or their purchasing transit from one or

109
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">more multiple providers so it's a little</font>

110
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">different that's pretty intense extent</font>

111
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,760
exhibit a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> extensive section and</font>

112
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,450
the pro style is a bit more accessible

113
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:46,860
as well so that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh war in a</font>

114
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:50,789
nutshell 405 we have eight or nine

115
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,680
proposed additional use cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

116
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,330
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put before the group to take a</font>

129
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,669
overflow scenario where where a DDoS

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,590
mitigating attacks and they're reaching

132
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,330
of their capacity in terms of transit

133
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,940
and mitigation faster so they signal to

134

other operators for assistance using

135
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,490

grammatical things and stylistic things

150

that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve from from 04 and</font>

they're the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing in the</font>

152
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,320
orchestration section it's not really

153
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,360
changing the meaning of the content in a

154
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,580
significant way it should stylistic with

155

anything else we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to continue to</font>

157
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,599
graphs we have two additional terms and

158
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,490
acronyms that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> define as well</font>

159
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,010
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our authors has changed</font>

160
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,470

document vo5 to reflect his new village

162
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:51,390
so that's all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have questions comments</font>

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:07,470
them out you know for comments before we

169
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:10,049
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at incorporating so not long can I</font>

170
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,020
quantify this with the date<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

171
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:18,630
expected date because not long its

172
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:20,880
relative term let let's say roughly

173
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,200
three weeks we can we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to target</font>

174
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,390
that but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be dependent on</font>

175
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,130
how much feedback you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get right</font>

176
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,690
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> thunderbolts and half the clue get</font>

177
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can get you for that kind of time</font>

178
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:35,010
frame but not not very long ok can I

179
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,810
suggest with working group hit first you

180
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,189
can actually if you have already seven

181
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:43,109
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can close to seven and second a</font>

182
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,820
feedback that comes I actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

183
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,710
encourage that this feedback is given up

184
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,580
on the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh we love young not off</font>

185
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:52,730
channel and then it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be again</font>

186
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,500
helpful if you just make an update and

187
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,450
you know don't don't be shy version

188
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,139
numbers are cheap we have plenty of them

189
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,989
so

190
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:04,779
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I Andrew Mortensen arbor</font>

191
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:08,199
networks you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming use</font>

192
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:11,290
case there with some dot servers that

193
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:12,939
were not capable or was that where we

194
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,608
have an ongoing area where they're all

195
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:17,139
dots capable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a looming area</font>

196
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:18,910
where there's multiples but only one of

197
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,609
them is dots capable can we talk about

198
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:24,009
the operational impact that will have on

199
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:25,209
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization that is request you</font>

200
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,999
know the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to take into</font>

201
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:29,679
account when they have to under it when

202
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:32,019
you're under<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not stab and then they</font>

203
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,119
end up going from you know three

204
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:35,199
upstream providers want right what kinds

205
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:37,839
of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to take into account</font>

206
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,699
that's actually a big part of dots that

207
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,470
I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of folks don't realize is</font>

208
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:44,139
that the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself is not magic</font>

209
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,419
great oh it's simply a lingua franca and

210
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:48,850
in the use cases we hope to give the

211
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,339
flavor of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other out-of-band things</font>

212
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,049
that have to be done in order to make

213
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,489
dots work good because one of the

214
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:56,079
outstanding issues on the architecture

215
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:58,540
draft is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing case so</font>

216
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:02,709
hopefully the use cases yes we also on

217
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,480
to our last architecture call in in one

218
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:07,059
of the use<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases its broadband access</font>

219
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,699
network where there are multiple dots

220
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:10,929
clients that are all signaling for

221
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:14,469
mitigation systems because it's a very

222
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:16,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">broad-based hat and we talked about on</font>

223
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,569
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it should be considered</font>

224
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:21,089
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for dots the dots servers</font>

225
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:23,410
themselves to try to consolidate

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:26,019
alerting or whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should be a</font>

227
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,360
meal up to the orchestration system what

228
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:35,439
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so we then that the three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font>

229
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:37,569
included thanks so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I ask if</font>

230
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:39,759
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> new additional questions I</font>

231
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:43,389
don't see how I<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Mike are there</font>

232
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,759
more use cases out there that you don't

233
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">see documented in any of the existing</font>

234
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:54,699
individual drafts or in the current

235
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:56,019
working group document well when we can

236
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:57,819
get a discussion going<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go ahead</font>

237
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:00,339
this evening and send out the seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

238
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:02,589
are already written down written out now

239
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,910
to help facilitate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get people comment</font>

240
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:06,209
on them hopefully we'll disruption

241
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,209
humans

242
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,500
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering whether we should probe</font>

243
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:17,250
the room for who has read 04 because

244
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:23,160
that is just recently released so did

245
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:27,120
who has read 04 yet okay well that's 76

246
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,139
a few people a handful yeah potentially

247
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,209
was too short notice before the meeting

248
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:35,970
so okay then I think we need some more

249
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:38,069
review and well if you can shoot out

250
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,250
some parts early then maybe the

251
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:44,370
reviewers will be more motivated it's

252
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">always a little bit people would be</font>

253
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,300
hesitated to review a draft if they know

254
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,199
all the next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is coming in a week</font>

255
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,029
yeah okay cool then yeah I encourage

256
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,219
that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think from a chair</font>

257
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:59,010
perspective in a couple of weeks or

258
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,070
months we need to go to last call so I

259
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:07,639
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right time to start to</font>

260
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:07,639
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> reviews more thank you Thanks a room</font>

261
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:16,100
thanks Roland next up is a discussion

262
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,100
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements Andrew</font>

263
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:31,519
it also occurred to me yesterday we

264
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:34,159
discussed getting the use cases draft up

265
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,199
into the dots wgf depository so you can

266
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,309
track the shoes there as well so

267
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully we want an update on that soon</font>

268
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:43,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so this is an update</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

work<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your glass call so you can</font>

278
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:06,499
actually monitor our progress toward

279
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:09,799
working group last call by tracking the

280
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:10,999
open issues just because that's the case

281
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:12,858
doesn't mean we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepting new</font>

00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:36,799
repository right now make changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

293
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:42,349
markdown and then set up a pull request

294
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:44,749
and we can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull it right in so</font>

295
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:48,709
we've closed about half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the known</font>

299
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,819
a whole lot of interaction there but

300
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:58,069
what we've gotten so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

301
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:59,478

update very<font color="#E5E5E5"> short they probably this</font>

303
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:04,970
week I've got another poll request or

304
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:08,569
two and we'll continue working toward

305
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,799
the work of your last call<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

307
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,149
recently closed issues you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

308
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,159
find them on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue tracker and I've</font>

309
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:17,720
also sent out I think a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple updates</font>

310
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,759
to the working for failing list on this

311
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,319
but I will touch on a couple of the more

312
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:25,489
significant ones issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> number nine</font>

313
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:28,149
pulled in some language from tears

314
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:31,099
signal channel draft about the path MTU

315
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:33,889
where the dots agents themselves are

316
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:35,299
asked to try to discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path MTU if</font>

317
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,329
they can't they fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some</font>

318
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:40,970
reasonable defaults I think it's 1284

319
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:44,059
default case and if legacy ipv4 networks

320
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:49,249
are a consideration to fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 576</font>

321
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:50,929
really necessary issue 11 covers what

322
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:54,290
sort of security state that dots client

323
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:55,759
can assume on redirection we<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

324
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,589
have some language there that says the

325
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,999
dots client<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assume that the</font>

326
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:01,610
security state is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the same</font>

327
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:03,529
on the redirection target but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font>

328
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,549
to try to do a session presumption using

329
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:10,309
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do a session</font>

330
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:13,009
presumption I think probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

331
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:15,980
other coast issues number 12 is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

332
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:17,569
significant this is trying to establish

333
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,059
the responsibilities of both parties

334
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:21,319
when it comes to mitigation requests and

335
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:25,249
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status feedback you get from the</font>

336
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:29,569
server this goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> some details as</font>

337
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:30,980
well about the details that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:33,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come back so packets per second</font>

things there<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they're less less</font>

343
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:49,189
important I think one of the major

344
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,748
concerns that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that big Dolson whose</font>

345
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:53,480
feedback kind of drove a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

346
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:55,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">issues had was about some of the</font>

347
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,290
indistinct language for things like

348
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:58,549
mitigation termination headline so we've

349
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,769
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clarify that and the</font>

350
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:02,209
responsibilities of both parties when

351
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:05,779
mitigation is actually considered to be

352
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:08,839
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminated this has an aspect</font>

353
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:13,459
where to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent route or DNS</font>

354
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:15,319
flapping dots client is it can make a

355
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:16,939
request terminate mitigation but the

356
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:18,618
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a small window to leave the</font>

357
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:20,689
mitigation running so if the client

358
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:23,439
decides to reenable mitigation rapidly

359
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:26,360
the dots client the dot server is not

360
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:27,769
announcing routes again rapidly I don't

361
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,749
know if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually concerned for</font>

362
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:32,059
people a sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an informal survey that</font>

363
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:35,269
I've done with some operators it seems

364
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:36,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be this is relatively important but</font>

365
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:41,299
others and also said we can just do

366
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:43,939
Ralph lap dampening so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

367
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:46,840
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some feedback if anybody</font>

368
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:50,650
hasn't well

369
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,240
our networks so um yes I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

370
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,560
in general it want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to be</font>

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">changing your network network state</font>

372
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,630
constantly on however you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my</font>

373
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,729
perspective and maybe this is how it's

374
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,320
been discuss I don't know this is not

375
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">really something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that should be built</font>

376
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">into dots itself necessarily but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an</font>

377
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,410
implementation not you know some of some

378
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,200
kind of timer and I think we actually

379
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,520
talked about that in the 00 use cases

380
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,069
draft and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when we're talking</font>

381
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the very basic case um we're not</font>

382
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,619
ems requests negation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then turnings</font>

383
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,150
terminates in mitigation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> term is an</font>

384
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,089
optional you know there could be an

385
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,280
optional timer where the mitigator keep

386
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,540
some negation active so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think</font>

387
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's necessarily something that</font>

388
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,909
should be built into dots itself but it

389
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,770
is certainly something that I would

390
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,750
believe an implementer would maybe want

391
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,450
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put that knob on here so one of the</font>

392
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,010
considerations here is we're trying not

393
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">to encode financial relationships right</font>

394
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,860
but one of the considerations here is to

395
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,080
try to figure out at what point the dots

396
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,050
clients responsibility and ownership of

397
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,790
the mitigation is actually over while

398
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,260
retaining that flexibility that you're

399
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,610
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dots server</font>

400
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,890
operators can leave the mitigation for

401
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,750
some small period but at some point the

402
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,030
dots client knows that after that timer

403
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,500
expires it's no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for</font>

404
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,670
the mitigation can just assume that

405
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,950
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's asking the mitigation</font>

406
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">determinated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dot server operators</font>

407
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,250
are free to let that continue running

408
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe they've got the attack has</font>

409
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,100
continued<font color="#CCCCCC"> to impact the Oscar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">operators network but not the clients</font>

411
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,730
and the dots client wants it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

412
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibility yeah roll it over to</font>

413
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">our networks um so in that scenario yeah</font>

414
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,990
we probably engineer this in the meeting

415
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,540
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you have the</font>

416
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,760
dots client<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes mitigation request dot</font>

417
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,730
server accepts that mitigation started

418
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,200
mitigation status messages are exchanged

419
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,540
then the dots clients is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I'm going to</font>

420
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,810
issue a negation termination request

421
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:40,330
great and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know my assumption</font>

422
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,909
would be that the dot server would

423
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,290
basically say no and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then sighting in</font>

424
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,360
litigation is still running and continue

425
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">to provide status updates you know until</font>

426
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,850
it based on whatever timers are

427
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:57,010
configured it decides that that will

428
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:58,149
indeed close the negation down yeah so I

429
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,830
hear I mean this could be a

430
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,700
configuration thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

431
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,470
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the dots</font>

432
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,510
I operators retain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operational</font>

433
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,880
control but I hear what you're saying

434
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,950
yeah is it control control is wrong word

435
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,930
because this is a communications medium

436
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,850
rain and as you said we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

437
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,530
enforce you know the contractual

438
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,540
relationship which are trying to

439
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,540
facilitate the communication so you know

440
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,670
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know timers or whatever</font>

441
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:24,730
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> special rules that allow for</font>

442
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:26,950
you know a force mitigation termination

443
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,350
from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> doc's client to a got server</font>

444
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:35,380
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost really almost outside the</font>

445
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:37,209
scope of dots oh my thanks so I guess

446
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one that's really worthy of</font>

447
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,390
discussion here on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this slide is</font>

448
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,520
the required an optional mitigation

449
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,950
scope types so previous revisions had

450
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,330
listed some example scope tights but

451
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,720
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were examples they were not</font>

452
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:51,929
required or optional so the required

453
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,990
scope types now are the obvious ones

454
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:57,790
ipv4 got a quad ipv4 prefixes ipv6

455
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,250
addresses and prefixes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully</font>

456
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,050
qualified domain names the optional type

457
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,590
right now there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one of them so</font>

458
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:07,690
feel free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest others is a URI and</font>

459
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:11,050
we previously also<font color="#CCCCCC"> had listed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

460
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,910
examples e 1 64 telephone numbers but

461
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,310
you can actually encode those as a URI

462
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,660
so that's I think that covers it and you

463
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:22,389
are I covers lots of different schemes

464
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:24,940
as well so we have I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think eight or nine</font>

465
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,620
remaining open issues one of them that

466
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,450
we discussed a bit yesterday during

467
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">design team meetings is the definition</font>

468
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,040
of what a session is if you look through

469
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,129
previous revisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the signal channel</font>

470
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,110
if I of the requirements draft there's

471
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,780
this kind of loose use of the term

472
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,219
session more or less interchangeable

473
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,450
with this the channel itself so I've

474
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,880
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone through I have a quarter quest</font>

475
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,170
now that replaces session the channel

476
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,150
and that made us revolve both of these

477
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,340
things getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave's input on this</font>

478
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:55,210
would probably let us know if we're

479
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,860
moving the right direction the issue

480
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,600
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> six is something I think is</font>

481
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably just a deletion we already have</font>

482
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,199
in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the security requirements a</font>

483
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,350
requirement from usual off I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over I'm going to skip 16</font>

485
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,860
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment and then we have some not</font>

486
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,660
considerations right now but they are

487
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,770
implicitly client<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

488
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,840
so we need to have some serving<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

489
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,210
considerations and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> upnp is</font>

490
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,800
something we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to add to the</font>

491
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:26,080
requirements or after a reference to

492
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:27,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">anyway um so issue 16 is how overlapping</font>

493
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,980
requests should be should be handled

494
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,680
let's say you have multiple dots clients

495
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,480
they detect the same tack separately

496
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,160
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> acquittal coordination</font>

497
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,140
between them they both asked for

498
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:43,380
mitigation for the same attack how does

499
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:45,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot server resolve that I've become</font>

500
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,170
less enamored of the idea that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot</font>

501
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">start would be responsible for resolving</font>

502
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,010
that I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this might have to be</font>

503
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,110
an implementation specific thing the dot

504
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,840
server turns a mitigator or whatever is

505
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:59,020
responsible for installing filters were

506
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,600
doing the putting the appropriate

507
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,580
countermeasures in place and depending

508
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,770
on what a mitigator says is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the dot</font>

509
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,050
server either rejects or adds the

510
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,610
mitigation it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quote on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> azure</font>

511
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,710
networks as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I know there's no</font>

512
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">concept of mitigation scope within Don's</font>

513
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,660
right again as you indicate that's

514
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:18,460
something that is really outside I mean

515
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,440
outside the boundaries of the DA system

516
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,330
now you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the client say okay I</font>

517
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,530
I'm requesting negation you know for

518
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">this particular slide your block right</font>

519
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,030
or for this particular you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

520
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">I or what have you but in the actual</font>

521
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,690
configuration of the mitigation scope

522
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,879
within the dr orchestration system

523
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,670
that's operated by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> des integration</font>

524
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,140
service provider is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need we don't</font>

525
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we're</font>

526
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,860
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start constricting guys to a</font>

527
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,540
particular paradigm of des mitigation

528
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> relies on a specific technology</font>

529
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:52,120
path we don't want to do that um could

530
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:55,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one slide please or more one</font>

531
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,850
where's the part about the fqdn it's

532
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,410
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue phenomenal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sorry it</font>

533
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,159
was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this light so do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really mean</font>

534
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,960
fqdn or<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean like the zone cut</font>

535
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,400
because fqdn has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very specific meaning</font>

536
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,590
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it is a very specific meaning and</font>

537
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,450
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I initially just had domain names as</font>

538
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,800
the initial language yeah and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font>

539
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">some input from another one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

540
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,620
editors who suggested replacing with

541
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,270
fully qualified domain have so that's

542
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,459
what's there yeah i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we probably</font>

543
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,020
replace fqdn with something else because

544
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd always that implies that we're only</font>

545
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:26,800
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a an fqdn na dots mitigation</font>

546
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">request in April client reality we might</font>

547
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,399
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say like</font>

548
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,590
you know star dot you know example that

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:39,180
a tu<font color="#E5E5E5"> been something like that every</font>

551
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:47,260
Fleming and raising the overlapping

552
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:48,850
request handling I understand why you

553
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,140
know you prefer on a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

554
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,540
having to deal with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not convinced</font>

555
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:55,290
that's right answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> my concern is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

556
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,580
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get into a scenario where</font>

557
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,490
requests are essentially client

558
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,320
specifics right and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving client that</font>

559
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,670
asks something would have to be the one

560
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that gets rid of it as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if there</font>

00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,940
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind of conflicts right somehow</font>

562
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,100
the clients have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to coordinate amongst</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves right I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

564
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,149
going to be workable so I totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree</font>

565
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,490
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah that's soap so I think</font>

566
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:18,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's an issue in terms of when you</font>

567
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:20,770
specify a neat mitigation for a certain

568
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,630
scope right how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that get reconciled</font>

569
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,610
between multiple clients that are not

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily coordinated and I don't know</font>

571
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,760
how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do that without having the</font>

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,540
this is might be an appropriate place

577
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,460
for the relay where we have that that

578
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,710
the aggregation of the signaling and the

579
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,060
relay is responsible for doing that I

580
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,160
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's any different</font>

581
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,250
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just having a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> serger do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

582
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:52,390
figuring out where the overlap is and

583
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:56,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">merging them what what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really did I say</font>

584
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:58,030
oh yes what wait way what gateway so

585
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,880
what I'm saying is no I'm being serious

586
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,230
right because when I understand yeah the

587
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,220
in one of our in the architecture we

588
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,020
have this diagram right where there's

589
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,560
this aggregated signal i'm right at

590
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:10,180
multiple downstream then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway is</font>

591
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,690
responsible for a sort of merging into a

592
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:15,700
single channel up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a dot server and</font>

593
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:19,570
that that aggregation sort of implies

594
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:23,440
the merging of these signal channels and

595
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:26,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scopes but that's since a gateway is</font>

596
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,970
just a back-to-back server and client I

597
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,129
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's only different than</font>

598
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,990
having a server do it let me rephrase my

599
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,390
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I you suggesting that we</font>

600
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:36,130
formally define what a gateway is and

601
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,470
the responsibilities that it has because

602
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,510
currently we don't open spot with that

603
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font>

604
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:46,790
I'm not not right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I would agree</font>

605
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:54,200
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them oh I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we got a chip away</font>

606
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:55,970
at this one you know I agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right i</font>

607
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the remaining open issues none of</font>

608
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,770
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are particularly contentious in a</font>

609
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:04,699
way that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlapping one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

610
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:07,549
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some ambiguity about what</font>

611
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,650
ownership and protected resources are so

612
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:12,260
we need to tighten the language there

613
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:14,270
and get some consensus on that and

614
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,280
adding a couple requirements for

615
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,750
authentication and<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorization this</font>

616
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,070
can just be put into the security

617
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirements section there's a lot of</font>

618
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,210
implicit understanding of what

619
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,740
authentication and authorization is

620
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:28,100
required we just need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that</font>

621
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,809
explicit and finally did brought this up

622
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,199
before the last in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your meeting about</font>

623
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:34,549
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> need for replay protection my sense</font>

624
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,520
is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be very careful here</font>

625
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:39,260
because any ability to replay might have

626
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,720
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact on the server operators</font>

627
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:47,270

628
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:48,890
full of<font color="#E5E5E5"> retha protections in place there</font>

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,230
the operational requirements section<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

657
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,840
architecture draft we have the anycast

658
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:07,760
consideration section where I think

659
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,590
maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this clear we</font>

660
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,540
talked mostly about using it as a method

661
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,209
for service discovery right it's a way

662
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:16,639
to this you use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> any cast at service</font>

663
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,860
address and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get directed to the</font>

664
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:25,130
unicast server that you should be using

665
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:29,030
I i think i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the yeah okay papi do</font>

666
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:32,120
you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> math regular i said</font>

667
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,190
how to eat though yeah right in that

668
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,820
case with any cashier you can send a

669
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:40,820
number change in there yeah yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

670
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,810
we should discuss that offline i'm not

671
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i have a good answer for you</font>

679
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,870
basis you know because they don't want

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintained multiple sessions from</font>

multiple customers potentially tomorrow

682
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:10,000
and so that that could have some value

683
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,309
their initiative with that could be

684
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,139
handled maybe via the data channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

685
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:15,519
guess which could be just<font color="#E5E5E5"> navigating</font>

688
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so then they figure just set it up</font>

689
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,620
sells out of the channel user palace or

691

693
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:41,590
okay other questions and comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

700
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,610
like the dots requirements we are

701
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,809
tracking open issues long if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

702
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:11,879
have issue tracker under the dots WG

703
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:15,000
group we only have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple remaining</font>

704
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,169
issues right now the document itself is

705
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,309
kind of paused while we're waiting on

706
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:20,220
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the use cases and</font>

707
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:22,230
requirements I think the the recent

708
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,400
movement on both of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those graphs is is</font>

709
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,620
getting us into position where we can

710
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,299
make the tweaks that are necessary and

711
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,559
we can get ourselves working group last

712
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:33,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">call soon the issues that we have closed</font>

713
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:37,320
recently do cover things like service

714
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,879
discovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> anycast and the the need for</font>

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,399
redirection in the dots of architecture

716
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,799

723
00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:00,059
open an issue we only have a couple

question for the use cases multihomed

726

dots clients are still something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:11,280
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort out I would like to talk</font>

so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to coordinate come to</font>

730
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,690
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's mutually agreeable and</font>

731
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,090
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> finally things like privacy and</font>

732
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:24,000
visibility for a Christmas signaling

733
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:26,129
this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a concern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the if you</font>

734
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,360
need to have let's say a mitigator wants

735
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:33,120
TP I into encrypted traffic are there

736
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,459
concerns about sharing private keys and

737
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,770
if you're using this sort of backstock

738
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,330
recursive signaling but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

739
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:42,780
covers it on the architecture draft

740
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,040
right now largely it's going to be some

741
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,620
coordination with the requirements and

742
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,210
use cases drafts and then if we can

743
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,290
knock out the remaining two issues I

744
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're ready for working group last</font>

call again submit any issues you have

746
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,570
with the current draft as soon as you

747
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:01,459
can so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can keep track of what</font>

748
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually is remaining before last call</font>

752
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:19,820
a bleep storm yeah and I'm not

753
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:22,369
advocating for it it's just a concern

754
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,320
about do we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention the perfect</font>

755
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:26,689
concern about privacy and security if

756
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,399
somebody is advocating for this in the

757
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,720
architecture draft we're not necessarily

758
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:34,459
advocating for the sharing of these

759
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:37,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">might accuse why wouldn't you just have</font>

760
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,869
a requirement that are that's it I'm

761
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:43,039
sorry I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a requirement that</font>

762
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:47,658
prohibits it we want to impose that on

763
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:51,908
somebody that you can what are you

764
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:54,830
wrapping this in what I'm using TLS

765
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:59,210
that's that's likely yeah so when you

766
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:02,299
had a 1.3 that's already done that the

767
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,739
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other static if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hum and</font>

768
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:06,590
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going on as well right so I</font>

769
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:10,220

00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:19,039

778
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:33,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting for this right this was an issue</font>

779
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,999
brought up by one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other editors</font>

780
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,199
and we've been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out is</font>

781
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:38,149
this something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to treat the</font>

782
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,799
architecture draft all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll well</font>

783
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,658
when at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least by the time against to my</font>

784
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:44,749
review i'll look at it and see if it

785
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:46,159
needs to be in the strap that all um if

786
00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:48,489
you're doing a negative statement

787
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,869
against it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would probably be fine</font>

788
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:55,029
maybe dropping it completely might be

789
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:55,029
your best bet yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

790
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">roland ovens are renette works a couple</font>

791
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,140
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are still outstanding</font>

792
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,180
for architecture as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as for</font>

793
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,760
requirements they require some fairly

794
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,990
dense discussions that might I mean we

795
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,550
want to keep things on the list as much

796
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:14,469
as possible but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't preclude</font>

797
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,080
having interactive discussions and then

798
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:20,709
summarizing providing the list so maybe

799
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,960
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can think about having a actual</font>

800
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,240
meaning you know a con call<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

801
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,399
interested parties<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss these</font>

802
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:29,290
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime relatively quickly</font>

803
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:31,149
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think with some interactive</font>

804
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,159
discussions we can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go through</font>

805
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:34,710
and not some more things down more

806
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,169
quickly than we could trying to trade

807
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,610
messages on the list I agree I mean I

808
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:41,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">would even settle for any discussion on</font>

809
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,690
the mailing list at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point on those</font>

810
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:46,149
issues with their be interest for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

811
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:52,480
do virtual item around virtual number

812
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:55,199
around this or sorry just one question a

813
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,760
timeline for this when do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">your gonna be doing ok thank you other</font>

817
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:17,530

announcement on man was this is the

826
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:45,610
draft we're talking about to pull for

adoption hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm nikki i'm here to</font>

828
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,660
present on this one Terry could make it

829
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:53,020
and it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

830
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,190
more of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> recap of the discussions we've</font>

831
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,220
had over the last couple of months and

832
00:35:54,190 --> 00:36:00,640
also the bits and pieces from the

833
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">interim meeting the main reason why I</font>

834
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,470
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recap it is because after the</font>

835
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:08,029
last meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a bit number</font>

836
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,490
discussions between myself and root area

837
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,260
and a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of others and we decided</font>

838
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:14,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the as far as the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trial goes</font>

839
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,160
the a lot of the efforts were converging

840
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:20,810
anyway so we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just converge</font>

841
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,670
onto this one draft so to that end the

842
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,560
data challenge using rest conf there

843
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,320
were young models in there they're

844
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">cooler yang they're funky the updated</font>

845
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,530
draft meets all the requirements as as

846
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,839
it has been have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much in</font>

847
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,970
line this draft being pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much in</font>

848
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:38,270
line with the requirements all the way

849
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:39,740
along still<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting on top of the stack</font>

850
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:42,140
that's very very familiar at the

restaurant TLS tcp/ip with<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot sitting</font>

852
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,660
on top of it um the rest Kong for

853
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,840
suggested and if you seem to make some

854
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,790
sense it's obviously a subset of<font color="#E5E5E5"> net</font>

855
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:55,370
can't it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a heavy use net com so we</font>

856
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:58,250
feel that might provide less overhead as

857
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:00,859
far as like implementation goes but then

858
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,660
kind of in it allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically use</font>

859
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:08,360
some common app commonality across other

860
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:09,379
efforts were it addresses the needs of

861
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:13,310
what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as like</font>

862
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:14,900
configuration so on you've got the

863
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,720
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what you would expect</font>

864
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,940
post put delete<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess to retrieve config</font>

865
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,319
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> and non config there was a tea</font>

866
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,160
lights are people liveliness it's

867
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,860
generally speaking the data channels

868
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,290
reasonably connection-oriented anyway so

869
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:35,540
it will be maintaining that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

870
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:36,890
along we've got a number of young models

871
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,750
in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> already and then we've got the</font>

872
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it exists and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> convert as well</font>

873
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:43,310
as we go a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our options</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

874
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,259
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of examples as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identify a model</font>

875
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:46,610
filter model you identify one is it was

876
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:50,210
discussed earlier regarding things like

877
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:52,160
fqdn and this question on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd be a</font>

878
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:54,740
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to basically assign an alias</font>

879
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the time with the actual mitigation</font>

880
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of define</font>

881
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,680
every single individual element you just

882
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,780
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh use alias one and that</font>

883
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,910
preferences IP address this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work this</font>

884
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,410
service of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so it kind of ties in a</font>

885
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,149
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those together and then it can be</font>

886
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,940
expanded as we go along maybe we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

887
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:13,700
fqdn I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are IE wants it or in there</font>

888
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:16,400
and stuff so they can just as we as we

889
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,640
wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as we as we see fit weekly pad</font>

890
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,109
that out

891
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,690
and that's pretty much it i mean it's

892
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:23,730
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it i think we've we've all come</font>

893
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,890
along same path of them the type of

894
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,480
things you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this particular draft</font>

895
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:32,519
and how it's been going in if we've all

896
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:44,849
been kind of getting there so that's me

897
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:47,669
done any questions comments sweet so

898
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:50,819
just agenda wise we built some time here

899
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,410
to talk about are we ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for adoption</font>

900
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:54,269
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a working group kind of</font>

901
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:56,480
artifact we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide today</font>

902
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:58,919
we have a poll<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on the mailing list</font>

903
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,440
because we travel and everything there's

904
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,920
two more weeks to provide your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

905
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,569
thinking on this after<font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf finishes but</font>

906
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">again we have time in the agenda if you</font>

907
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:10,319
like to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feelings endorsing</font>

908
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:20,970
this or you have some concerns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'd</font>

909
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:22,470
like them voiced<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fleming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> andreasen I'm</font>

910
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,629
supportive as I said on the mailing list

911
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:26,250
I think makes a lot of sense I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

912
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,589
direction that is going as well makes a

913
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of sense which to me is more of a</font>

914
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:33,150
separation of theta channel NBC<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hong</font>

915
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">satellite is really is operational stuff</font>

916
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:36,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean configuration related data and a</font>

917
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:41,308
signal channel can then leverage that

918
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:43,319
data later on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like it by the way</font>

919
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:44,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not to say that they're on any it's</font>

920
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:47,730
that it's still not being worked on them

921
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:50,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dave race and some comments before</font>

922
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,779
regarding the eye again comments around

923
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,519
the idea session but also the comments

924
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:56,309
around hit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas of cuddling and so</font>

925
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,319
on that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at absolutely</font>

926
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:59,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">nikka me just to clarify adopting just</font>

927
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:02,759
as a working group document<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

928
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:05,460
accept and and it all suggests that what

929
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:07,710
is in that draft is is concrete it is

930
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,779
completely valuable it's just that we're

931
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:13,920
accepting the existing text as a working

932
00:40:09,779 --> 00:40:16,009
for artifact I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mascis HD consulting I'm</font>

933
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,460
all for this being a working group

934
00:40:16,009 --> 00:40:22,380
document it keeps one aspect simple so

935
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,390
we can keep our focus on the the really

936
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,390
driving part which is the signal channel

937
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:37,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">OOP okay thank you then that moves us to</font>

938
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:40,020
the next part I'm unhook this one as

939
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:42,990
well yes the signal channel which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

940
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:49,920
more entry more challenging<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font>

941
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:51,569
the swings okay so um one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reasons</font>

942
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">why I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to present this one in the</font>

943
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:56,609
absence of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thiru is because I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

944
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:01,170
get some color around why why would sort

945
00:40:56,609 --> 00:41:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of converging around this one the shell</font>

946
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:08,910
even open so there was a protocol

947
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:11,250
document the week before which<font color="#E5E5E5"> sported</font>

948
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:13,319
protobuf zamora beaconing type of

949
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,150
singling there was this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one which was</font>

950
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:17,160
using co-opting<font color="#CCCCCC"> see bore and there was</font>

951
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,260
some other variations on there again

952
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,440
what we had a discussion after the last

953
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,510
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we we came to the conclusion</font>

954
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,109
that we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again try and</font>

955
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:30,720
converge on a single path just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce</font>

956
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:32,460
the amount of duplication and so on to

957
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,319
that end we've kind of decided that in

958
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,490
the absence of being able to kind of

959
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,529
standardized on protocols at this

960
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,848
particular time then<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we thought we</font>

961
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:42,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">could do is at a later date may be used</font>

962
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:44,240
as a content type we were using credit

963
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:48,689
buffs in our original draft as an IDL

964
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,910
and leveraging that in the new a draft

965
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,829
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> down in new revision satiric put</font>

966
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:56,700
together and stuff it moved more towards

967
00:41:52,829 --> 00:42:00,660
that some boards a similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps ybor</font>

968
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,430
having a similar aspects as its protocol

969
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,339
things like the mapping and so on the

<font color="#E5E5E5">also having discussions with Fleming and</font>

972
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:12,359
so on what we saw was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't really</font>

973
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to go through the rigmarole of</font>

reinventing tcp or UDP and congestion

975

control and all these type of day to the

coop we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that for a soak so</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one the highlights is again we</font>

978
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,339
have the young in there it's a

979

mitigation request model configuration

980
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:35,220
model and so on including rules defined

981

in the core young cyborg<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it compiles</font>

nicely

see poor again is being used or

prominent of signal map to see more

985

types we're using particular types and

nothings to ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

again make it a bit more efficient

rather than kind of complete that

constantly reiterating<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the</font>

between Jason and coding versus say

something like protocols the mitigation

994
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:05,799
response and the requests are now marked

1000
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:18,519
shaping in this one and two good<font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

configuration star flag does confirm

1003
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:23,709
also we have sort of have the best of

1004
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:25,238
both worlds and we have printable

1005
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:27,009
messages when we need them non

1006
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,199
confirmable than we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

1007
00:43:27,009 --> 00:43:32,739
there what we've decided to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1008
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:34,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well as tranki so that we have static</font>

types we kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to remove some</font>

1010
00:43:34,419 --> 00:43:38,469
the ambiguity of 0 in<font color="#CCCCCC"> peacetime we could</font>

1011
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:40,269
have confirmable you know and so on so

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bhutan is like these ones will</font>

characteristic these of 14 bills<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

1015
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:48,569
characteristics there's no ambiguity in

1016
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:51,429
figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what you know kind of</font>

1017
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:55,959
various aspects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what peacetime is</font>

1018
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:58,809
versus you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what you know what time</font>

1019
00:43:55,959 --> 00:44:02,669
is the heartbeat mat mechanism is<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

1020
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:04,839
the car ping we're looking TTL is 1.3

1021
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:06,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">their sport never event specific</font>

1022
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,639
parameters which we feel is important

1023
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:12,089
and for extensibility and so on added

1024
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:14,259
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> mutations those parameters which are</font>

1025
00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:16,179
somewhat useful for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint to be</font>

1026
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:18,279
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what's going on it's</font>

1027
00:44:16,179 --> 00:44:22,539
like a very basic basic level of

1028
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:25,089
telemetry for the the originator to be

1029
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:26,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to figure out you know what as far</font>

1030
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:29,439
as like if the attack on going as you

1031
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:32,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">tackle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on going what it's saying it can</font>

1032
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:35,459
then try a degree of status yes Larry so

1033
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:39,399
with regard to sorry Andrew Mortensen

1034
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:40,689
the TLS versions do you think that we

1035
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:44,019
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be blocked waiting for</font>

1036
00:44:40,689 --> 00:44:46,388
detail s 1 point 3 this morning I mean

1037
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:47,618
it's there are no competing<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS drafts</font>

1038
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:50,019
right but it's still individual draft

1039
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:51,010
yeah I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose but</font>

1040
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:53,890
none

1041
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,960
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to decide if we're waiting on</font>

1042
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:57,970
it yeah overall detail s has been a bit

1043
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,940
of it well the dtls has been a bit of a

1044
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:02,439
pain in this um not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much because DC</font>

1045
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:08,200
less itself but the available libraries

1046
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:09,750
out there are painful say the least to

1047
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,700
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to do what we wanted to do</font>

1048
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,650
there's either you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're just</font>

1049
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:20,529
either lacking or they're just so hard

1050
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:22,110
to work with this isn't that so but

1051
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,880
that's pretty much it so deal with this

1052
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:26,230
weekend which we're trying to move

1053
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,990
towards this to consult<font color="#CCCCCC"> wars</font>

1054
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:31,180
consolidation I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether we're</font>

1055
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:33,189
completely ready to to say that this

1056
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">one's ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for adoption yet but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1057
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:37,750
doesn't mean we couldn't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1058
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:45,790
question again comments or questions

1059
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:48,150
welcome maybe it's a chair quick

1060
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:52,600
question why do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1061
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:54,010
not ready yet my personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion is we</font>

1062
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">just need to refine it a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more and</font>

1063
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:59,800
that's maybe just being a bit precious

1064
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:01,630
it's it's more it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I'll</font>

1065
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,760
guess I guess it's more cosmetic than

1066
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:05,260
anything else my opinion is to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1067
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,640
my opinion is that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just feel we need</font>

1068
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,010
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe just refine it and</font>

1069
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,940
just have it flow a little better and I

1070
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,380
think that's something that's actually

1071
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">been working to in the most in the most</font>

1072
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,160
recent variation most recent version and

1073
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,470
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it'll be out in the next version</font>

1074
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,000
as well and I think we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to</font>

1075
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,649
it but I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few tweaks</font>

1076
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,080
and everything that just you know just

1077
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,460
before we go with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> having said that</font>

1078
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I said let's not say we could</font>

1079
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:31,870
master coach slamming<font color="#CCCCCC"> andrea's so I've</font>

1080
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:34,240
ever support the notion of trying to

1081
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:35,950
converge on a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> value yeah I think</font>

1082
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,350
I mean what this group needs to produce

1083
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:41,890
right our<font color="#CCCCCC"> protocol specifications in the</font>

1084
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:43,509
end um well one of each one for<font color="#CCCCCC"> today I</font>

1085
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,529
don't yes you're right not multiple of

1086
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:47,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and the sooner we can get to that</font>

1087
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:49,060
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the better in terms of you</font>

1088
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:50,500
know where do we focus our energy right

1089
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,630
i mean we had the information model as

1090
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,820
well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason that we have that my</font>

1091
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:57,190
friend is because we have had competing

1092
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,930
protocol suggestions in there like the

1093
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:01,480
data model is in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> already like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

1094
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,859
thing for the data channel so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1095
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">could find a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way of converging on a</font>

1096
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,190
single protocol

1097
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,230
of a signal channel I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

1098
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:10,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very helpful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the group overall so</font>

1099
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:13,059
I would certainly support it from that

1100
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:15,250
point of you cook and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know i think</font>

1101
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:17,859
it was reasonable right as a starting

1102
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:19,329
point oh yeah i mean i mean what's in

1103
00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:21,038
there at the minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really have</font>

1104
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:22,930
any issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the content</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this we</font>

1105
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:24,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">just need to it's just flowing likes it</font>

1106
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,868
cause my dear I mean a plenty of details

1107
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:32,980
still right but you don't get you want

1108
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:34,839
to change yes not my skirts<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do have</font>

1109
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:39,670
two concerns from what you said Nick

1110
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:43,660
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that the am Angie said TLS</font>

1111
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:47,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">dtls 1.3 blocking what's the</font>

1112
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:50,640
consequences<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that that no what no</font>

1113
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:53,740
what is it that why do we want 1.3 and

1114
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,259
thus the blocking we may need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font>

1115
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,118
that out the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the comment</font>

1116
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,730
you mentioned about detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actual</font>

1117
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:04,809
detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice implementations and issues</font>

1118
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:06,250
regard to that is so is their experience

1119
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:07,779
which is showing us something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that week</font>

1120
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:10,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be need to be concerned with</font>

1121
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:12,670
or any gave maybe some implementation

1122
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,279
recommendations which we may need we

1123
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:17,019
need to stay say in the as as

1124
00:48:15,279 --> 00:48:18,609
informational information but something

1125
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:21,490
they had to put in the document with

1126
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:24,220
regard to actual experience no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1127
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:26,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">those are both great comments and as far</font>

1128
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">as our invitation goes implementation</font>

1129
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:29,500
attempts of gun<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what we found</font>

1130
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,730
and where we have heartaches is because

1131
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,559
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get this working</font>

1132
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:34,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a little while and now very in our</font>

1133
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,619
various efforts and it's like just

1134
00:48:34,029 --> 00:48:38,500
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the one that's you know</font>

1135
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:41,170
the ticks all the boxes that we feel we

1136
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,150
need having said that I think if we if

1137
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,200
we do start to consolidate on single

1138
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,490
draught and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to kind of</font>

1139
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,649
say well now we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to talk about</font>

1140
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:49,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stuff then we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can start to them dig</font>

1141
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,789
deeper figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what is what we need</font>

1142
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:54,339
what's lacking what we can tolerate you

1143
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:55,690
know even yes and so on and then we can

1144
00:48:54,339 --> 00:48:57,819
figure out well is it is this a blocker

1145
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,950
or can we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something else you know</font>

1146
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:03,369
is it is the for example I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrew</font>

1147
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:04,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">used the tiniest cell which had an</font>

1148
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:07,529
implementation that might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great</font>

1149
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:09,549
but would it be sufficient you know so

1150
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:12,150
there's those questions to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up but</font>

1151
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:15,230
yes I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> your comments or well noted</font>

1152
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:17,210
thank you

1153
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,950
I Andrew ones and I think I'm kind of

1154
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:20,869
responsible for the question about

1155
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:23,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether we should adopt now but that was</font>

1156
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:24,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">on revision 09 revision 10 has</font>

1157
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,750
incorporated a bunch of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1158
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:33,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be okay talking about adoption in</font>

1159
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:39,410
spike maybe maybe that is indeed than a

1160
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:42,190
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask maybe before I ask that</font>

1161
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:46,520
we should ask who has read documents

1162
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:49,760
okay so okay who has read draft ready

1163
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:53,440
dot signal channel version eight nine or

1164
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:57,880
ten<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that makes it cos hid it</font>

1165
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:00,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that's a couple of roughly 10 12</font>

1166
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,650
keep your<font color="#CCCCCC"> hands roughly okay just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1167
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's a sizable amount of</font>

1168
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:13,880
people so um master so actually show me

1169
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:16,730
off now okay let's be let's be let's be

1170
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:20,420

1171
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:22,790
would be I'm gonna ask the question who

1172
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,890
would be comfortable know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's in favor</font>

1173
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:27,109
of adding adopting this is a working

1174
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:31,009
draft the answer would be yes no or

1175
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:33,950
don't know so who's in favor yes crazy

okay this figure shows the outline of

our application the core of application

1242
00:54:51,339 --> 00:54:59,599
however finding good libraries such as

1252
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:30,950
there's some that implements the go lang

00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:15,530
hi Jeff Hodges if you don't need to

1285
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:17,720
really be using the seein as the subject

1286
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:19,790
name you should probably be looking at

1287
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:27,709
using the subject alternative name

1288
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:29,660
extension and mapping to DNS in that and

1289
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:33,200
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need to use a distinguish a</font>

next 500 distinguished name in in the

1291
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,390
subject you can put

1292
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:40,640
whatever you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there but you</font>

1293
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:50,060

1295
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,600
I agree completely with your observation

1296
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:54,920
this is you know what we were alluding

1297
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,750
to I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as well with your</font>

1298
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,280
authentication and authorization model

1299
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,590
and also the separation of the signal

1300
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,240
I'm data channel the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right now</font>

1301
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:03,920
is not right i mean the signal channel

1302
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,839
and data channel I independent right

1303
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,370
it's the data that's being conveyed over

1304
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,380
them that you have to reconcile in the

1305
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:10,819
back end<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have to have an occasion</font>

1306
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:12,920
or authorization model that works for

1307
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:16,160
that I think right now it says it's

1308
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,690
based on the dots you know client ID or

1309
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,549
something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree i think is</font>

1310
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:21,440
too narrow I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your fear more</font>

1311
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,450
flexible with me mad so what extent we

1312
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,150
need to specify that versus that becomes

1313
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:32,750
you know a back-end operator issue I'm

1314
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:34,760
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure yeah but separation updates</font>

1318
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:48,920

channel can be placed in different

1325

1337
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:03,279
see many occasions when that might be

01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,200
useful for whatever reason I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1341
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:11,680
we said before either single signal only

or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave channel or combined but spread</font>

not captured right now in the current

1345

captured in that I don't think some<font color="#CCCCCC"> text</font>

1347
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:34,330
yeah I think it I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could imply</font>

draft clearly enough then that means it

1352
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:52,529
needs to be clarified there yeah so

1353

thank you yeah sorry for interrupting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

enjoy mortensen I was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

1355
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:58,690
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> any if you've done anything toward</font>

1356
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,210
client provisioning at all my

1357
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:07,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">bootstrapping or if that's still coming</font>

1358
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:10,480
down the road although yeah their client

1359
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:15,120
provisioning yeah so so getting the

1360
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:18,790
keying material ok now I'm death<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that I am software page only reading</font>

1362
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:26,470
that typifies fighting about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> equate</font>

1363
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:33,550
of the mitigation who hey I'm Amy I'm

1364
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:37,299
kind of bomb a squid some this last

1365
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:40,240
slide where you had the one data channel

1366
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:42,790
with multiple armed signal channels

1367
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,790
pretty much flies in the face of your

1368
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:48,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous comment about how to connect</font>

1369
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:50,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two authentications together to pair</font>

1370
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:54,820
them up because you basically have

1371
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:57,220
almost like a reverse multicast sort of

1372
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,540
a situation here or how they didn't ease

1373
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:01,790
are going to done this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to take</font>

1374
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:05,240
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> real serious of thought</font>

1375
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:08,029
about how to do the the identity control

1376
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:10,430
such that you have what linkage you want

1377
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:12,430
it's an interesting use case but it's

1378
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:15,290
going to take some real serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm</font>

1379
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:20,810
thought of how to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and feel</font>

1380
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:25,610
uncomfortable with it hey we can live

1381
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:28,610
our party Jefferson organisms you

1382

1384
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:37,430
right so my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you have a</font>

1385
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:39,680
timeline for that or whenever you play

1386
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:46,069
into the never the code to release the

1387
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:51,140
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay uh now I'm trying to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:56,120
our raviga<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department oh I don't know</font>

1390
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:02,569
cannot promise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you however it will be</font>

1391
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:08,300
between these a big meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the next</font>

1392
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:10,970
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> clementa isn't just responding to</font>

1393
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:12,980
Bob's comments before I actually don't

1394
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:15,230
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> them at us with each other at all i</font>

1395
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:17,840
think they're very well aligned to use

1396
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:20,030
case in areas that get there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1397
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:22,100
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common I it's not the channels</font>

1398
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:24,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bound together right it's</font>

1399
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:26,990
the data that they're operating on and

1400
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:30,170
controlling access to that data that

1401
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:33,009
needs to be sorted out I don't see

1402
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:33,010
anything at all consider

1403
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:51,109

01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:31,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">liebe for you to the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

1418
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:36,230
where is the blue sheet who needs the

1419
01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:37,670
blue sheet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if we could just pass</font>

1420
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:40,010
the blue sheets up to whoever needs the

1421
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:41,270
blue sheet thank you Fleming Europe if

1422
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:47,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could tell us about your</font>

1423
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:49,250
implementation so uh mm-hmm I can tell

1424
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:54,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">you about series implementation it's uh</font>

1425
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:54,609
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine i will do my best you know</font>

1426
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so if you recall the</font>

1427
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:04,098
presentation that we did at the last I

1428
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:06,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">ETF there was actually a couple of</font>

1429
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:10,160
slides in there about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proof of</font>

1430
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:12,230
concept that was done back then and it's

1431
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,029
pretty similar actually in terms of the

1432
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:16,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">information that's in here the major</font>

1433
01:05:14,029 --> 01:05:18,079
difference is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> proof</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concept</font>

1434
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:20,959
implementation has been updated to

1435
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,670
reflect the latest draft so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1436
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,289
the overall framework here californium

1437
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:26,750
especially on the server side that's the

1438
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:28,640
same as for the last time you go online

1439
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:31,039
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not download yourself if</font>

1440
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:33,618
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play around with it there</font>

1441
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:35,000
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> various api's in here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isaac was</font>

1442
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:36,680
mentioning right there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> these related</font>

1443
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">to congestion control our than I</font>

1444
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:41,750
important message transmission

1445
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:43,400
parameters heartbeat timeouts which we

1446
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:46,099
specifying as part of your ball toss

1447
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:49,010
protocol operation and then the new part

1448
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:51,140
here about messages being confirmable or

1449
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:51,930
non confirmable<font color="#E5E5E5"> also that's being</font>

1450
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:54,240
leveraged

1451
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:58,140
well now in the end of a concept that's

1452
01:05:54,240 --> 01:06:00,779
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> has done the client side is</font>

1453
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:03,450
browser-based so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a plug-in</font>

1454
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:05,820
copper again there's a URL here where

1455
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:07,710
you can go fits that that will enable

1456
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:09,360
you to essentially come up with your own

1457
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:11,370
messages and then you can send those to

1458
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:13,200
the server and you can play around with

1459
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:16,620
those and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of what's been</font>

1460
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,330
done here is an example of those again

1461
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:21,450
you see we have an example here<font color="#CCCCCC"> non</font>

1462
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:26,370
confirmable message seaboards what we're

1463
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:27,870
using and this is another there is a way

1464
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:30,210
of actually decoding some of these

1465
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:32,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">messages back and forth if you wanted to</font>

1466
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:33,930
see there's a URL for that as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1467
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is just basically illustrating you</font>

1468
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:38,339
an example message here how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

1469
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:42,270
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> encoded and what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be sent</font>

1470
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:47,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">across so that is it for the proof of</font>

1471
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:53,520
concept from<font color="#CCCCCC"> terror any questions or</font>

1472
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:55,710
comments on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1473
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">making so we just had two</font>

1474
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:59,880
implementations are there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a</font>

1475
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:02,339
third one lurking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wants to</font>

1476
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:04,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">bring up or aspiration for</font>

1477
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,850
implementation

1478
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:19,720
Barry green for akamai I think um in

1479
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:21,970
hallway conversations leading up to this

1480
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:24,759
and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did last week a read-through</font>

1481
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:30,339
of all our docs from the point of view

1482
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:31,869
of implement as Russ white and I were

1483
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:36,040
talking we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go down</font>

1484
01:07:31,869 --> 01:07:38,140
the path of cider<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so I think we</font>

1485
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,579
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to instigate implementations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1486
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in a phase where</font>

1487
01:07:39,579 --> 01:07:46,119
it's not just asking who's implementing

1488
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:47,920
I think it's dumb there are there's um

1489
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:49,480
efforts where you can have several

1490
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,670
companies get the governesses ok we're

1491
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,980
going to instigate we're going to pay

1492
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:55,599
some University go do it or you can you

1493
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:57,640
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments who throw money at</font>

1494
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,609
projects like this you know it's I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1495
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,259
um now's the time to start you know in

1496
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:04,990
several people you know involve of the

1497
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:06,970
drafts or<font color="#E5E5E5"> say like oh we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not ready</font>

1498
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:09,368
yet this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no now's the time to</font>

1499
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:11,618
start to instigate the implementation

1500
01:08:09,369 --> 01:08:13,450
our roadmap of deployment right because

1501
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:15,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we</font>

1502
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:17,889
come to fruition for this work we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1503
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,480
get our roadmap of deployment I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1504
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:21,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a the co we have a prototype</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font>

1505
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:24,608
ballot make sure it's done you start

1506
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:27,850
that now get the funda now right like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1507
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:32,620
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know on the you know like</font>

1508
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:35,109
for instance of you guys see see if you

1509
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:37,210
know right right if if we don't we don't

1510
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:40,600
if we don't have vendors starting ACC

1511
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:41,859
process it concept commit process these

1512
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the sort of things we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

1513
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:46,450
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> going with it because as you</font>

1514
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:49,210
start it now you know we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to more I</font>

1515
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:52,238
ETS you know we're making<font color="#CCCCCC"> some good</font>

1516
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:53,890
progress on the specifications things

1517
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:56,200
will get closed out and as we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1518
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:58,120
people using the docks you know what

1519
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:01,568
we'll find and discover things in tune

1520
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:03,939
the work so if there's I think if

1521
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:05,259
there's anybody interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I</font>

1522
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:08,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a side little</font>

1523
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:11,020
instigation sort of of discussions going

1524
01:09:08,259 --> 01:09:13,870
on and start rolling<font color="#CCCCCC"> this out and then</font>

1525
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:15,549
in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea report out for the</font>

1526
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:17,528
working group is to have a sections of

1527
01:09:15,549 --> 01:09:21,250
saying okay what's the result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1528
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:24,219
efforts of getting things moving on<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1529
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:26,109
implementation operational deployment by

1530
01:09:24,219 --> 01:09:30,040
two cents

1531
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:32,440
thank you completely agree any other

1532
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:45,689
vendors researchers want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak up</font>

1533
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:48,219
about their plant implementations yeah

1534
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:49,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so two things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your bison I've</font>

1535
01:09:48,219 --> 01:09:51,310
been talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it our first now that</font>

1536
01:09:49,988 --> 01:09:53,500
we're talking about individual

1537
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:55,750
specifications do we want to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1538
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:58,510
this as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the hackathon that's</font>

1539
01:09:55,750 --> 01:10:01,570
held saturday before ITF perhaps in

1540
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:04,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Prague we're Singapore and given that we</font>

1541
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:06,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">have two implementations at one point we</font>

1542
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,460
start talking about interop between them

1543
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:14,580
so things on our minds if you're

1544
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:17,920
interested please do let us know<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1545
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:20,139
the last item<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our agenda is not</font>

1546
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,699
directly related to some of the specific

1547
01:10:20,139 --> 01:10:25,480
architectures we've been kind of talking

1548
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:34,750
about so next up is talking about IP fix

1549
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:37,480
usage so Marvin<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Marvin</font>

1550
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:41,580
don't play from Huawei<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm gonna</font>

1551
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:45,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you a brief update on the interrupt</font>

1552
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:47,260
ok this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> countin I would go through</font>

1553
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:51,250
the background the changes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

1554
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:53,830
iteration ideas issues in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> step the</font>

1555
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:56,739
main main purpose of these presentations

1556
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:59,889
to do some clarifications so the

1557
01:10:56,739 --> 01:11:02,799
background as you'll see why would I be

1558
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:09,190
fixed draft appear in adults<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

1559
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:12,250
group the first thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> um actually our</font>

1560
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:17,080
draft targus same problem space that we

1561
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:21,010
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve that dots attacks but the</font>

1562
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:23,679
approaches we approaches we are taken by

1563
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:27,610
taking are given differently as you have

1564
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:29,500
learned that dots is more about

1565
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:33,699
signaling building the signaling

1566
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:39,010
mechanism but our job is more about

1567
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:39,790
building a data analysis platform so so

1568
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:47,200
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

1569
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:50,580
and so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes as the working group</font>

1570
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:56,620
chairs just this is a little bit of the

1571
01:11:50,580 --> 01:12:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the scope of dots so this the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why</font>

1572
01:11:56,620 --> 01:12:03,880
we submit this revised the draft is

1573
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:07,150
because it's a little bit about the

1574
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:11,380
history the original draft was here so

1575
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:15,429
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present the new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a PT job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1576
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:21,180
maybe we can hear some opinions from the

1577
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:26,710
floor about security issues alright so

1578
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:30,300
the nest like ah what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> propose in this</font>

1579
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">trap is actually a collection of IP fix</font>

1580
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:36,760
information elements as you can see on

1581
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:39,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the left best the original setup I've</font>

1582
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:45,790
been fixed elements in the last

1583
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:50,080
iteration so it is in the new trap that

1584
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:54,160
we have armed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the IP fixed</font>

1585
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:59,860
elements and we have actually removed a

1586
01:12:54,160 --> 01:13:03,070
lot of IP fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> Edmonds because the</font>

1587
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:07,920
removed I be fixed elements they can be

1588
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:11,769
implemented using the existing animals

1589
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:14,830
through some combination or complex

1590
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:16,750
structures so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a maybe a lesson</font>

1591
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:20,350
learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you that if you want to add</font>

1592
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:23,110
some new IP fix information elements you

1593
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:26,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">should really look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the unique 16 ones</font>

1594
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright and so what's left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the new</font>

1595
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:33,820
trap is it's all about TCP connection

1596
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:39,670
tracking that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept would like</font>

1597
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:44,910
to promote so as I said before we like

1598
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:47,410
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> butte a data analysis platform so uh</font>

1599
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:51,430
so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect a certain</font>

1600
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:52,220
information from TCP connections and it

1601
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:57,260
is

1602
01:13:52,220 --> 01:14:00,830
is by a by using big data technologies I

1603
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:03,710
am using<font color="#CCCCCC"> this password because because</font>

1604
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:06,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information we collected from the</font>

1605
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:09,890
typical anxious don't have to be very

1606
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:12,170
accurate actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just want to</font>

1607
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:15,230
monitor the changes that behavioral

1608
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:19,850
changes of those characteristics in

1609
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:25,599
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> TSP connections so so i chose on</font>

1610
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:29,570
IP fix because we need some mechanism to

1611
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:33,200
export those information from kiss p TCB

1612
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:36,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">traffics and as you know that I Vivek</font>

1613
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:40,150
see small standard and is widely bought

1614
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:44,810
it so we just need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add some new</font>

1615
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:49,000
information elements so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the main</font>

1616
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:53,690
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the diagram</font>

1617
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:59,200
what slack what's what's lacking the idx

1618
01:14:53,690 --> 01:15:03,169
information elements is the sum of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1619
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:07,280
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information related to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

1620
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:11,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up all the timing information</font>

1621
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:15,830
for example the timing information that

1622
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:20,240
is related to this participe three-way

1623
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:24,950
handshake which is used to set up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

1624
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:29,719
connection some attacks may our result

1625
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:33,349
in a very abnormal that changes in those

1626
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">times so we believe collecting of</font>

1627
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:41,990
clicking these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information is</font>

1628
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:46,760
and processes it in arm in a statistical

1629
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:50,410
way can help us detect anomaly in TCP

1630
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic's what so what do you mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1631
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:57,980
TCP connection tracking as you know that

1632
01:15:53,660 --> 01:16:00,620
TCP has certain secondly<font color="#CCCCCC"> in flex so we</font>

1633
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:05,269
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some flax set for all those</font>

1634
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:10,070
that is basically in flex if we

1635
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:13,910
observe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sink then we observed a sink</font>

1636
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:18,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">ACK that's normal but we said that flex</font>

1637
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:21,680
only if those blacks occur in the

1638
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:24,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">connection in a normal sequence if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1639
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:28,430
not in the normal sequence then we will

1640
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:32,210
not set those information we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not</font>

1641
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:35,000
not set those flags so by clicking this

1642
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:39,560
information we were it would be easier

1643
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:44,810
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to tell apart what the TCP</font>

1644
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:47,050
traffic is doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right we also want</font>

1645
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:53,450
to incorporate some of the informations

1646
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:57,020
about the the packet and the time

1647
01:16:53,450 --> 01:17:00,349
intervals between different<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP segments</font>

1648
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:04,700
because that might be armed exploited by

1649
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:06,710
the attackers so this these are a basic

1650
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:11,320
set<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information would like to collect</font>

1651
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:13,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">around his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feet connections and nest</font>

1652
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:17,000
which will realize there are certain

1653
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:21,500
issues regarding our solution the first

1654
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:24,410
one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sim message asymmetric traffic</font>

1655
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:26,030
as we know their internet is more and

1656
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:31,840
more is becoming more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

1657
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:35,179
asymmetric so this will limit the

1658
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:37,880
applicability of our solution because we

1659
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:41,900
need to collect the information from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1660
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:46,790
conversion point that can observe both

1661
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:50,179
the uplink and downlink TCP traffic they

1662
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:54,530
also they also some concerns about the

1663
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:58,640
performance yes um if the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1664
01:17:54,530 --> 01:18:02,230
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stream the bottom of the</font>

1665
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:08,120
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really a large that might</font>

1666
01:18:02,230 --> 01:18:10,099
require<font color="#E5E5E5"> a super power device deployed on</font>

1667
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:13,910
the conversion point to collect such

1668
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:19,179
kind of information so these are major

1669
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:24,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">two issues that we we are now are facing</font>

1670
01:18:19,179 --> 01:18:29,389
and basically so as I said this is just

1671
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:34,489
some clarification from the front for

1672
01:18:29,389 --> 01:18:37,429
this working group so I we appreciate

1673
01:18:34,489 --> 01:18:40,610
that way to some discussions in the

1674
01:18:37,429 --> 01:18:42,710
email list and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate the old</font>

1675
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:45,920
comments you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> given to us thank you</font>

1676
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:50,690
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much and so the next step we are</font>

1677
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:53,719
we're going to take might be when I

1678
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:59,690
submit our IP fix information elements

1679
01:18:53,719 --> 01:19:02,120
directory to iono the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ANA but the reason</font>

1680
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:05,150
we are doing another reason we're doing

1681
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:08,750
this presentation is because we want to

1682
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:13,460
solicit comments for you as much as

1683
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:26,659
possible so thank you adding questions

1684
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:29,929
or comments no thanks very common um so

1685
01:19:26,659 --> 01:19:32,330
what I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggest because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's</font>

1686
01:19:29,929 --> 01:19:34,880
ok that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vettes to having users as of</font>

1687
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:36,320
that mechanism as a working group but

1688
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,469
this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an individual submission</font>

1689
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:41,659
document correct it currently is non in

1690
01:19:39,469 --> 01:19:42,739
the working group right so so then you

1691
01:19:41,659 --> 01:19:45,440
would do an individual submission

1692
01:19:42,739 --> 01:19:49,339
documents submitted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Anna diana is</font>

1693
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:52,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a question who's going to</font>

1694
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:54,380
be the technical reviewers right so the

1695
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:57,409
question to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group is we'd be</font>

1696
01:19:54,380 --> 01:20:01,040
appropriate technical reviews sorted to

1697
01:19:57,409 --> 01:20:03,259
clarify the IP fix registry is expert

1698
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:08,239
review expert review<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's expert review</font>

1699
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:11,690
right specification right and and there

01:20:13,639 --> 01:20:16,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just submit and see what they start</font>

1703
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:23,089
to getting the feedback from them

1708
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:32,170
right

1709
01:20:40,920 --> 01:21:02,469
well what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use the mic if we want</font>

1710
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:05,019
to follow up on that Kathleen Moriarty

thoughts while you're presenting as well

1713
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:14,159
and thinking you know see if the what

1714

<font color="#CCCCCC">with it another thing and just looking</font>

1717
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:25,360
at the what you're proposing it looks

1718
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:28,389
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the types of things we see</font>

1719
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:31,598
that come from the opt area in terms of

1720
01:21:28,389 --> 01:21:33,250
the types of measurements and you know

1721
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:36,929
when we look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> scree considerations for</font>

1722
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:40,900
them we just couch it and in frame it

1723
01:21:36,929 --> 01:21:43,809
down to its minimally necessary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1724
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:46,799
try to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best we can to protect the</font>

1725
01:21:43,809 --> 01:21:49,239

1726
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:54,369
there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to get the Sun</font>

1727

either here or an<font color="#E5E5E5"> OP yeah I mean I think</font>

are surmountable obstacles right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

1730
01:21:58,389 --> 01:22:02,949
when you're dealing with proprietary

1731
01:22:00,219 --> 01:22:05,199
data in a management system obviously

1732
01:22:02,949 --> 01:22:09,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protect it in certain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

operational paradigm for this kind of

1738
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,260
information because you wouldn't

1739
01:22:21,429 --> 01:22:28,869
wouldn't want to leak it even if it

1740

didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff on there all</font>

thoughts comments or concerns to share

1748
01:22:49,209 --> 01:22:52,688
version whether we're going to be

individual submission of the dtls 13

01:22:56,590 --> 01:23:00,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">two and three are interoperable and are</font>

1755
01:23:02,919 --> 01:23:07,959
proceed with details 12 for now and when

1756
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:19,539
detail s13 is available we can we can

1757
01:23:07,959 --> 01:23:22,059
deal with it to be as Cano muah be a non

1759
01:23:22,059 --> 01:23:33,610
for detail s 1 point 2 i'm a i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> robi</font>

01:23:31,719 --> 01:23:36,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">hamilton I'm with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chemical abstracts</font>

1761
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:39,759
can't see but it actually is remember so

1762
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:44,050
i have no idea for sure what mitigation

1763
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:46,320
means here and if there's of the

1764
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:51,130
implementations that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've seen so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far is</font>

1765
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:54,518
there anything specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> in those as far</font>

1766
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:58,179
as mitigation goes reason I'm asking is

1767
01:23:54,519 --> 01:24:03,869
were a DDoS attack target on a regular

1768
01:23:58,179 --> 01:24:06,999
basis now and every IP address that

1769
01:24:03,869 --> 01:24:09,419
tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to us is different and</font>

1770
01:24:06,999 --> 01:24:12,280
so as far as I can tell there could be

1771
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:18,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">500 billion people trying to connect us</font>

1772
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:20,139
so I don't know necessarily even how to

1773
01:24:18,249 --> 01:24:23,079
tell other than the fact that suddenly

1774
01:24:20,139 --> 01:24:27,130
we're out of sockets on a server so

1775
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:28,749
anyway that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> question angel roll under</font>

1776
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:34,209
you answering this question that

1777
01:24:28,749 --> 01:24:36,519
question yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew Mortensen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

1778
01:24:34,209 --> 01:24:37,780
networks so mitigation is we are

1779
01:24:36,519 --> 01:24:39,039
attempting to define what mitigation

1780
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,809
means in the requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft there's</font>

1781
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:42,429
some terminology there so please<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

1782
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:44,050
look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific definition and see</font>

1783
01:24:42,429 --> 01:24:46,119
if it covers what you're talking about I

1784
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:47,770
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specific form of</font>

1785
01:24:46,119 --> 01:24:51,400
mitigation whether using something

1786
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:54,520
in a firewall or a DDoS<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigation</font>

1787
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:57,070
device or just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put out flows</font>

1788
01:24:54,520 --> 01:25:01,300
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolls to block is within the scope</font>

1789
01:24:57,070 --> 01:25:04,509
of dots itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roland Evans or networks</font>

1790
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:06,190
so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at previous iterations in</font>

1791
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:09,600
the use cases draft there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

1792
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:12,009
examples that do talk about some

1793
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,480
mitigation technologies but the purpose

1794
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:15,490
of one of the purposes of dots is the

1795
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:16,839
big technology independent in terms of

1796
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,820
the negation technology so we're not

1797
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">locked into a given paradigm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rate on</font>

1798
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:22,750
some of the you heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier in a</font>

1799
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,849
meeting we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some the</font>

1800
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:27,790
initial proposed use cases will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1801
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:30,280
coming coming out and those feature

1802
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:32,530
different technologies and so forth to

1803
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:40,120
provide some I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess color commentary</font>

1804
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:43,570
great the<font color="#CCCCCC"> help hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a or color to</font>

1805
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:45,750
the discussion as far as the way i<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

1806
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:48,040
it i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the simplest way it</font>

1807
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:50,380
power-crazed<font color="#CCCCCC"> andrew in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pastas mean</font>

1808
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:53,440
the world idea of dots is to basically

1809
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:54,700
say help it hurts here and then as far

1810
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:57,219
as the mitigation goes that could be

1811
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:58,660
anything I mean it could be unplug it

1812
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:01,030
you know it could be anything at the end

1813
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:02,470
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> too is in scope as far as well I</font>

1814
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:05,290
could be but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want to</font>

1815
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:06,940
prescribe that because that people's

1816
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:08,470
ideas are different you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1817
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:10,000
people's definitions are different and

1818
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:14,020
it's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a whole world of pain</font>

1819
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so i think we're skirting around</font>

1820
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:17,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions very green outcome I um</font>

1821
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:20,200
because you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you're in</font>

1822
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">serious pain right now so here's my</font>

1823
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,380
suggestion because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work that we're</font>

1824
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:26,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here in ittf as a you decide</font>

1825
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:27,340
this is two years out this is a lot of

1826
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:30,490
we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves better</font>

1827
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:32,920
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do is I'll point you to</font>

1828
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:34,690
a little guy I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say here's how</font>

1829
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:37,060
you can bring your vendors in to figure

1830
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:38,919
out what is right for you but you add

1831
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:41,080
one new question<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right based off of</font>

1832
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:43,090
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with implementations every vendor</font>

1833
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:45,430
you pull in to say how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you help me</font>

1834
01:26:43,090 --> 01:26:48,970
Yusei what's your deployment planning

1835
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:50,560
your roadmap for dots<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right these</font>

1836
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:52,510
are asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dutch rome at</font>

1837
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,920
then you pull all like the vendors in

1838
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:56,140

1842
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:06,670
question what do you got is it dots and

1843
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:08,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at you go like what's dots</font>

1844
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:14,740
this is don't get a clue get on board

1845
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:16,780
with the future thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1846
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:20,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">question because this is an excellent</font>

1847
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:23,230
example about how people read things

1848
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:26,230
into our documents or look for things

1849
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:28,150
and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ensure that the</font>

1850
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:30,690
architecture doc which is over people go

1851
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:35,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to first all there's a dots architecture</font>

1852
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:37,960
clearly calls out how know where

1853
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:40,420
mitigation fits into this and that week

1854
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:42,400
I believe we do we're mainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1855
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:45,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">strengthen just a little bit more to</font>

1856
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">clearly point out that this is how we</font>

1857
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:53,290
signal for call for help mitigation is

1858
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:56,920
over there so that that so people coming

1859
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:59,110
to hear saying i'm in pain will know

1860
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:00,940
that they have to go over there for that

1861
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:02,200
pain addressing for right now that

1862
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:04,000
that's all I've been through many of

1863
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,889
these before<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the documents did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1864
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:10,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">clearly call out what's in scopus out of</font>

1865
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:12,640
scope and where else to look yeah I

1866
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:14,260
would plus one that not comment that

1867
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:16,780
nabob just made fresh eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1868
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:18,430
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> are wonderful and if you don't</font>

1869
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:20,380
feel like you see yourself reflected in

1870
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:23,850
the use case please let us know because

1871
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to update the text to do that</font>

1872
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay other topics to bring up to the mic</font>

1873
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:43,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so catching actions from the</font>

1874
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:46,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion so we agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going</font>

1875
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:49,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept the decidua as a working group</font>

1876
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:51,700
document so if the authors can resubmit

1877
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:54,820
that as a working group document will

1878
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:56,410
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> will get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that approved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1879
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:58,540
remind everyone we're still pulling for

1880
01:28:56,410 --> 01:29:00,340
adoption on the data channel documents

1881
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:01,900
since we started that before the working

1882
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:03,820
group so again if you have feelings

1883
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:06,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">either way please do drop that on the</font>

1884
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:08,259
mailing list there's time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then with</font>

1885
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:10,390
the time we have remaining not that I'll

1886
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:12,370
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that long just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to review the</font>

1887
01:29:10,390 --> 01:29:14,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">proposed milestones and I would</font>

1888
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:16,269
reiterate what you're about to see here

1889
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:19,450
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tobias and I have seen and we'd</font>

1890
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:22,150
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss these with you so we of</font>

1891
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:23,710
course are behind on everything we have

1892
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:26,650
the use case requirements and

1893
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:29,860
architecture documents as a straw man to

1894
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:33,129
say working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group last call after prague</font>

1895
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:35,620
in September what is the reaction of the

1896
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:42,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group to that and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1897
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:44,559
authors on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this draft I enter Mortensen</font>

1898
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:46,450
speaking for myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not necessarily</font>

1899
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">for my co-authors I think we this is</font>

1900
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:50,950
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> conservative for the requirements</font>

1901
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:55,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">in architecture so you mean you could do</font>

1902
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:55,800
earlier cool what should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we write there</font>

1903
01:29:56,370 --> 01:30:05,380
sorry for<font color="#CCCCCC"> being so specific Saturday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

1904
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so meaning to its two weeks or</font>

1905
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:12,330
something sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone saying not to be</font>

1906
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:18,160
clip I think probably buy buy a product

1907
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fleming andreas i think you do</font>

1908
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:21,970
need to stagger the requirements and the

1909
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:24,220
architecture document a little based on

1910
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:26,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the discussion at use cases while i use</font>

1911
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:28,210
case and requirements yeah hopefully we

1912
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,740
can do that a little bit sooner but you

1913
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:31,630
need a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> space for the architecture</font>

1914
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:33,429
to reflect whatever changes go in there

1915
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:34,720
and also hopefully reflect that you

1916
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:41,020
working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call comets that come</font>

1917
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:47,310
in so if I internalize what you just

1918
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:50,320
said use case requirements july ish so

1919
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:52,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">august/september architecture so i'm</font>

1920
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:54,040
only altered on the architecture

1921
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:55,690
document so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm quite happy</font>

1922
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:59,110
with September I'm not as ambitious as

1923
01:30:55,690 --> 01:31:01,179
my co-author but that I will let the

1924
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:08,200
authors of the use case and requirements

1925
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:09,610
documents for themselves Daniel yeah i

1926
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:14,809
think the use case should be addressed

1927
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:17,870
by two month<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

1928
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:22,160
so what I'm hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> authors</font>

1929
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:23,690
is July use case use case in

1930
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:25,880
requirements I'm sorry we're not editing

1931
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:30,530
this live and then architecture document

1932
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:31,730
staggered later for September further

1933
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:33,110
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the working group</font>

1934
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:35,150
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kathleen's not officially</font>

1935
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:37,670
listening to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us yet because will</font>

1936
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:38,990
submit this what's the reaction I mean

1937
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:45,620
any comments is everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable</font>

1938
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:47,900
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and then then it comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1939
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:49,910
the actual protocols and so here we got

1940
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of things so first our</font>

1941
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:53,510
official milestones actually say we're

1942
01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:57,380
making a data model document and a

1943
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:59,150
transport document uh my counterproposal

1944
01:31:57,380 --> 01:32:00,740
to that is it looks like we're

1945
01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:02,750
converging towards a data Channel

1946
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:04,670
document and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> single channel document</font>

1947
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:06,530
so first<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> argue that we want to</font>

1948
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:09,970
change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature of the milestone</font>

1949
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:14,719
itself and then tossing out a gauge of

1950
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:16,720
I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> of December on both votes so</font>

1951
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:19,160
does anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any feelings on first</font>

1952
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:21,950
rebranding what the milestone itself is

1953
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:24,349
and then the timing of it um hi nicht

1954
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:26,570
ich um no I'm for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I think that um</font>

1955
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:28,040
that's let me mentioned before as far as

1956
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:29,389
data model information little goes they

1957
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:31,880
were probably more necessary when there

1958
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:33,710
was a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dates I think now</font>

1959
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:36,200
there's a degree of<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversions then it</font>

1960
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:38,810
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be just those particular task me</font>

1961
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:45,050
just converged into that that function

1962
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:53,270
so yeah other reactions from from the

1963
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:55,280
working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> on those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well</font>

1964
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:56,810
Kathleen we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> submit mr. you</font>

1965
01:32:55,280 --> 01:33:01,550
officially for your review so you can

1966
01:32:56,810 --> 01:33:04,700
stare at them just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we described okay</font>

1967
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:06,680
so this actually brings us to the end of

1968
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the agenda we have time so if anyone</font>

1969
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:13,340
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up to the mic going once</font>

1970
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:15,530
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> twice okay well thank you everyone</font>

1971
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:18,140
for participating thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

1972
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:21,830
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will send out the invite for the</font>

1973
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:26,310
upcoming virtual interim discussion in a

1974
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:28,500
few days and yeah if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I close</font>

1975
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:30,060
and if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have the blue sheets</font>

1976
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:32,190
whoever has them if you could run<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1977
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:34,290
up to the front who has not<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed the</font>

1978
