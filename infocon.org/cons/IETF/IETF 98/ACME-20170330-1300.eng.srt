turns out one they were not involved in

the ferris bueller's day off movie and

10

44
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:16,950

acne<font color="#CCCCCC"> ide draft has a few points for</font>

46
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,310
discussion that might have known

47
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,849

50
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,010
each one of pigs because these are all

51
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,870
false estimates as we all know they come

52
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,429
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of number Wang a great game if you</font>

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:42,079
to the topics on there I think we'll go

55
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,078
ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask Richard come</font>

56
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:10,000
acne acne so we've been at this for two

57
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,670
years in two years since<font color="#CCCCCC"> bones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> County</font>

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,149
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so since the last</font>

59
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,769
time so I'm hoping next slide I think a

60
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,450
theme here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that there's nothing</font>

61
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,560
too big because we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been through last</font>

62
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,409
call now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got a bunch of good</font>

63
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,650
issues and hopefully we're getting about

64
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">done and I can send this to the iesg so</font>

65
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we didn't want to have</font>

66
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing big is that big things require</font>

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,770
realized calls and so we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid</font>

68
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,469
that and keep the document movie next

69
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,990
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please so quick review what we've</font>

70
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:45,990
done since the last IETF meeting next

71
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:49,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide the usual graph of commits as</font>

72
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,960
usual the ID deadline<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very clearly</font>

73
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,180
indicated by the commit graph over time

74
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,320
as usually we've kept up our pace of

75
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,240
having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of different contributors</font>

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,950
and thanks to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who sent</font>

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,830
for requests or reviewed pull requests

78
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,680
help keep this pace pretty lively

79
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,330
through the winter next slide please so

80
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,760
just a quick review here there's a bunch

81
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,710
of editorial PRS that improve grammar

82
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,840
and commas and terminology and things

83
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:19,870
like that slide um several PRS that we

84
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,489
agreed at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last IETF that we would do</font>

85
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,979
some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are pretty technical and</font>

86
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,940
pretty significant but it already been

87
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:30,610
discussed so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to discuss</font>

88
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:33,430
them further here yes um one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

89
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,810
major technical changes was to name to

90
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,560
change the names<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we apply to things</font>

91
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,390
changing registrations to accounts and

92
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,450
was a new certificates a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> to new</font>

93
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,669
order there were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few PRS related to</font>

94
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,890
just kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleaning up terminology</font>

95
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,390
from that and making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were</font>

96
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:53,770
consistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> in saying everything the same</font>

97
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,750
way throughout the document yes finally

98
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,840
the a bunch of what we got in last call

99
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,390
was comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the kind of general</font>

100
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,830
data model of the protocol has and had

101
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,130
kind of accreted over the couple of

102
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,300
years we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working on this and uh</font>

103
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,740
some of the reviewers noted that there a

104
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,539
bunt there were several things in there

105
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,090
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't using anymore and could</font>

106
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:14,400
safely take out so for example on the

107
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,409
account object had a

108
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,758
reflected the public key associated to

109
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:23,370
the account so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if you</font>

110
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,440
requested your account object from the

111
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,060
server it would say here's the contact

112
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,820
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have and here's the public</font>

113
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">key I have the observation Jacob made</font>

114
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,150
that convinced me this was not useful

115
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:36,060
reflecting the key wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

116
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,948
the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the key in the</font>

117
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">first place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make the request because</font>

118
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:42,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">it requests for count objects or access</font>

119
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">controlled and so there really is zero</font>

120
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,780
utility and reflecting that back<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

121
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,550
the fact that the server is sending this

122
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,010
account objects the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> is already</font>

123
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">proof that the client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has the key that</font>

124
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,539
goes with the account so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we took</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

125
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,630
out and similar arguments for these

126
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,460
other things so just lots of cleanup

127
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,169
going on that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do working a lot</font>

128
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,549
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> grief last call's is to discover what</font>

129
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:08,520
we've done wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far next similarly a</font>

130
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,940
bunch of small things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like changing</font>

131
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,370
content location to location revising

132
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">how Pina native we were about HP KP and</font>

133
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:20,550
redirects<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tweaking Xin HTTP response</font>

134
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:24,090
codes so things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people were</font>

135
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,830
being super precise about things like

136
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,659
response codes might require some code

137
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:32,130
changes but you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing from</font>

138
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,539
like 2012<font color="#CCCCCC"> 204 so not major stuff but</font>

139
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,800
still you know if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got an</font>

140
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,729
implementation going you might have to

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,470
tweak to address these things next all

142
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,389
right that's that's the entire history

143
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the summary of the history to hear any</font>

144
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:48,090
questions comments on what we've done in

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,289
the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months yes I don't think</font>

146
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,830
there's anything major there are no

147
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:55,080
major we are connecting they mainly just

148
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,560
streamlining and tweaking things to be a

149
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more consistent nicer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

150
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,320
so let's let's go skim through the open

151
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,049
issues um so for each of these open pr's

152
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,880
open issues in github and mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font>

153
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,620
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got kind of started those</font>

154
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,599
three bins kind of triage those into

155
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,130
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like things that Jacob</font>

156
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,960
and I could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> triage intimate decide</font>

157
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,780
for ourselves and things I thought

158
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">merits and discussion here for these you</font>

159
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,570
know those are the PRS we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

160
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now that are mainly just editorial</font>

161
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,090
fairly minor things that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font>

162
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:29,889
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to spend meeting</font>

163
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,199
one here unless someone has a really

164
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,940
strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion about your eyes vs URLs I</font>

165
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,370
know that something see people get

166
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,659
exercised about anyone would go to the

167
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,240
mic<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that and not seeing anyone</font>

168
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:43,718
leaping up um the one I wanted to

169
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">discuss here was to decide once and for</font>

170
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,190
all which<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge names we use once</font>

171
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,230
this goes to RFC next slide so the

172
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,450
current document says hey we're

173
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,820
attaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft numbers to these</font>

174
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,320
challenge names right now because we

175
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,760
might revise them as we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

176
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,589
internet draft IETF process but dear

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,540
diana<font color="#E5E5E5"> GRC editor once this becomes an</font>

178
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:07,540
RFC please script those version numbers

179
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,770
and just use the bearer tokens the idea

180
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,839
here is that you know these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are nice</font>

181
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,640
clean human intelligible names that are

00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,950
cleaner for all the future usage post

183
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,660
RFC and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> likes to say</font>

184
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,220
the future is bigger than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past so</font>

185
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,140
you guys will<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it clean for the big</font>

186
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,270
future and not constrain them with the

187
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,060
legacy of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early implementation we've</font>

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,550
done here well and pointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that this</font>

193
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,089
numbers around on challenges because we

194
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,520
might discover some future date that

195
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,290
were unhappy with precisely how the HTTP

196
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,600
challenge works we might want to upgrade

197
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,870
it to have another version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the HTTP</font>

198
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:52,450

<font color="#CCCCCC">the direction we're headed right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

201
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">think Roland is pretty enthusiastic</font>

202
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,839
about keeping the version numbers around

203
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,360
and I think he's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well sold me so</font>

204
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,550
there's no objections that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just be</font>

205
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,459
good the first column that they would

206
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,829
call her the same right yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font>

207
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:14,709
correct haha yeah it says the proposal

208
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,940
is to keep what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we might we</font>

209
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,199
might have to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the semantics</font>

210
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,630
because right now it says that the

211
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">version number is the draft version in</font>

212
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,850
which the change was introduced so we

213
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,790
might just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to register things with</font>

214
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:30,400
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the version attached but yeah if we</font>

215
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,839
were voting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Air Force</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crolla if we were</font>

216
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,360
voting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd vote for features bigger than</font>

217
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:39,430
the past but I also I'm not like willing

218
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,570
to like go to the mattresses for it any

219
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:45,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">other opinions</font>

Daniel your nurse tonight any<font color="#CCCCCC"> McCarney I</font>

221
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,360
kind of counter with our agree with role

222
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,250
in this position on here i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

223
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,410
the state of the ecosystem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

224
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,910
number of clients that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are involved i'd</font>

225
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,439
rather just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it the way it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

226
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:01,959
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this significant</font>

227
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,310
justification of that breakage Mary

<font color="#CCCCCC">Barnes yeah i mean i agree keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it the</font>

way it is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a big</font>

230
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,069
deal whether or not you know version

231
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:13,060
number of applause just use these<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

version numbers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah welcome to</font>

235
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,640
know the true yes the show shelby

236
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:24,970
versions shall we say I'm to let the

237
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,030
minutes reflects so resolved next slide

238
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:31,120
please so that was PRS there's some

239
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,410
issues in github as well most of some of

240
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,950
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been already been addressed</font>

241
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:38,050
by PRS that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already landed so I</font>

242
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,510
just struck those through for now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

243
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,189
couple of which are just minor text

244
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:46,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">tricks there were three I wanted to run</font>

245
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:50,110
past this group real quick so next few

246
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,670
slides um<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> encrypts ping me with an</font>

247
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,860
issue they'd had with some clients with

248
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,030
bugs that would they have clients had

249
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,290
some bugs that would create a bunch of

250
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,730
pending authorizations as<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

251
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,390
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the client working and</font>

252
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,980
because let's encrypt a great limits

253
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,439
pending authorizations as you can hold

254
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,610
them have only have so many outstanding

255
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,050
authorizations they on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the state</font>

256
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,610
where they were wedged in like they

257
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,959
couldn't try anymore to get their client

258
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,940
working because they've already created

259
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,490
so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> state on the server and to</font>

260
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,860
compound that yeah well so we built in

261
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,970
this nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> deactivation of authorization</font>

262
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,280
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could kind of deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

263
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,230
situation if you had the URL for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

264
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,660
authorization to say deactivate this

265
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,550
authorization but these clients because

266
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,510
they were still<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get things</font>

267
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,829
working weren't keeping those

268
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,540
authorization your l's grounds they

269
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:36,010
couldn't use the deactivation thing um

270
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,839
so josh from<font color="#E5E5E5"> watson cook called me and</font>

271
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:42,580
said hey we have this issue question is

272
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,900
should we address this bottom bolts are

273
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,610
kind of my opinion here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's</font>

274
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not worth addressing this super</font>

275
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,170
specifically but it seemed like a one

276
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,720
way you could address this while having

277
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">a fairly high degree of generality is</font>

278
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,460
reading this authorizations field to the

279
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,140
account

280
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,550
objects so that you know an account

281
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,350
holder could enumerate all the

282
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,770
authorizations that have been attached

283
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">to this account over time um that seems</font>

284
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">like kind of an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay idea to me just in</font>

285
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:11,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of exposing server state and it</font>

286
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,410
would have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hindi effect of</font>

287
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,410
addressing this I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> dickham thank you oh</font>

288
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:29,410
hi so<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else from let's encrypt</font>

289
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:31,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">omelette I have a friend and I can't</font>

290
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">really talk about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think this</font>

291
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,189
can actually be solved by Oliver I'm

292
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,340
living with fergie cycle and then

293
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,230
authorizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other words and this</font>

294
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,320
is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a comp it part of the latest</font>

295
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:47,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">version of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stack so if you ask for a</font>

296
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,780
new order and there's already exists a

297
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,300
pending authorization or one of those

298
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:55,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">names the server is free to and its</font>

299
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,949
continued to you we use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

300
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,920
authorization so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this will just</font>

301
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,460
become a non issue with the latest stack

302
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,599
and they don't think any filters part

303
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,760
taken do you have any objection to

304
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,210
adding this authorizations field two

305
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,680
accounts just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for completion um you can</font>

306
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,350
get to the authorizations through the

307
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:19,839
orders so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like extra complexity</font>

308
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:21,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">for not a lot of web so too pretty um I</font>

309
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,950
was actually going to say something

310
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite similar to what Jacob said but</font>

311
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,300
slightly different<font color="#CCCCCC"> my thinking I think</font>

312
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:30,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can also deal with this by having</font>

313
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,439
either a timeout for an overflow on

314
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,900
pending authorization so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want the</font>

315
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,790
right limit to keep you from<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

316
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,199
getting overloaded by with them but you

317
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:43,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">could also have a simple time out that</font>

318
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:45,940
says they age out of the queue if

319
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,099
unaddressed or if a certain number of

320
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,470
coming and this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep you from</font>

321
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to add anything to the protocol</font>

322
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it especially since this is caused</font>

323
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,370
by buggy clients adding protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> probs</font>

324
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,260
to deal with buddy clients doesn't

325
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:04,960
strike me particularly useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're at</font>

326
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:06,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">least adding an age to old things so</font>

327
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,750
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> HEV anyway</font>

328
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,250
can also be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to failure modes in the</font>

329
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,020
network or somebody request something

330
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,390
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a network breaking they</font>

331
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,329
can't actually come back to a thing yeah

332
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,860
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that pending authorizations</font>

333
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,930
are already required to have an expires

334
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,820
field in which case so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

335
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,250
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is at worst a temporary</font>

336
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,930
wedge yeah I can't a given that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

337
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,060
have already have a expires field I

338
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:33,260
think adding more props because doesn't

339
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:35,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Eliza first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok Daniel did you had any</font>

340
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,040
further on them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I McCartney no I</font>

341
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,660
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> echo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do have an</font>

342
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,860
expires field on there i think presently

343
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,050
for let's encrypt it somewhere around

344
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,670
seven days and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is really just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

345
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,410
problem for people that hit that limited

346
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,349
don't want to wait seven days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and don't</font>

347
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,029
have the authorization URL yeah and

348
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously if ca's had concerned about</font>

349
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:54,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">this they could tweak that expired</font>

350
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,750
window downwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

351
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a no action on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one we</font>

352
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">can just close the closed the issue</font>

353
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:04,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright um this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a super minor thing I</font>

354
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">think Jacob suggested this right now</font>

355
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,660
this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is kind of the</font>

356
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,000
entirety of the recommendations<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

357
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,740
for client behavior in terms of how you

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,459
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sequence of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requests</font>

359
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,540
getting a certificate and the

360
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,709
recommendation here is that you know

361
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,569
once you've gone through the whole

362
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,890
submission in order and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

363
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,860
respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenges you need to</font>

364
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,569
see when it is that the server thinks it

365
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,120
has validated your challenges or it's

366
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:32,240
made of its mind this recommendation is

367
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,459
that you pull the authorization URL of

368
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,880
which there might be several for a given

369
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:39,529
certificate the suggestion here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

370
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,149
a change that's pulling the order URL

371
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:43,880
which is actually more efficient because

372
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:45,020
that gives you the certificate URL just

373
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,270
wanted to put this out there on the

374
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,490
floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it was a is kind of a</font>

375
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:53,329
technical change that seemed sensible to

376
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:57,100
folks not seeing any<font color="#CCCCCC"> dramatic reactions</font>

377
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:57,099
Oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jacob back to you</font>

378
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,580
alright so I don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

379
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,980
recommending this it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be somebody</font>

380
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:08,110
else I recommended this one possible

381
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:11,360
issue is so if one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the authorizations</font>

382
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:13,760
they'll also connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the point</font>

383
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:17,089
Google raised about retrying individual

384
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,879
challenges if we allow that the order

385
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:21,470
won't transition when challenges fail so

386
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,410
you would pull the in the case where the

387
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,780
challenges fail you point<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon the order</font>

388
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,410
forever so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

389
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,550
interaction there and then favor

390
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,840
continued recommend get off see for now

391
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,840
but I could totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> be convincing</font>

392
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,470
so Jacob where that then end up for you

393
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,009
okay with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> change or did you want to</font>

394
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:52,499
do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different um I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

395
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:56,179
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it at it for now based on</font>

396
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:59,580
Hugo's feedback about tribal challenges

397
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:01,110
okay so maybe let's table this until we

398
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,019
get to that which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit later</font>

399
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:06,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">um this the end not a huge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change it's</font>

400
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:09,509
not really normative anyway so you can

401
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">always tweak all right next issue here</font>

402
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:15,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">um resource relations so someone pointed</font>

403
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,070
out I forget who exactly it was that we

404
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,899
have this link relation between an

405
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,509
authorization and the order that created

406
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:23,969
it but authorizations can be used across

407
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:26,100
multiple orders so you know I assume it

408
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,899
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example calm and I get</font>

409
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,090
authorization for example calm than I

410
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:33,840
issue 200 more certificates using that

411
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:36,539
authorization which link what do I set

412
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,029
this up link relationship to when i get

413
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:40,320
that authorization resource on seems

414
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:42,929
like there's kind of three obvious

415
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,570
answers 1 you set<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the order that</font>

416
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:49,169
created the authorization you provision

417
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:51,720
200 link relations to each order that

418
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:54,570
use this authorization or you could just

419
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,450
delete this entirely and rely on clients

420
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:01,320
tracking which orders go which with

421
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:03,119
author authorizations um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

422
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,649
preference would probably be<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just</font>

423
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,029
drop it because I don't get the sense

424
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of usage of these</font>

425
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:09,570
linked relations going on but if people

426
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought this was valuable in terms of</font>

427
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,830
tying all these resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> together I</font>

428
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there could be some argument for</font>

429
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,850
keeping them does anybody have an

430
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,690

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">right not hearing any one standing up</font>

435
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,158
for the continued presence of this link

436
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,689
relation I'm going to go ahead I'll

437
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:52,059
propose we go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plate it okay</font>

438
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,860
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to mailing list issues these</font>

439
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:56,289
are kind of the threads that I saw on

440
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:59,408
the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that were not filed as</font>

441
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:00,610
issues and not resolved there may be

442
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,840
some where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the chairs have a</font>

443
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,799
couple on the agenda that are bigger

444
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:11,529
issues so yeah let's go through these

445
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:13,240
real quick looks like these defining

446
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:15,460
revocation were clearly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erika port</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

447
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">I suggested that this was this our</font>

448
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,340
description of revocation is kind of

449
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,779
ambiguous because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a leash</font>

450
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,939
should scattered throughout it about

451
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,649
what the client has to do to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

452
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's authorized to revoke a certificate</font>

453
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:28,539
now our default you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are fairly</font>

454
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,700
conservative in the specification about

455
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:32,230
what we require a server to do because

456
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,059
servers are bound by things like the

457
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,399
baseline requirements and route programs

458
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:40,840
as to what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can do can't do</font>

459
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:43,120
um however<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case you know you are</font>

460
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,299
within the scope of the revocation

461
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,939
mechanism that Acme defines and so it

462
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:52,000
seemed to me like you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> um perhaps</font>

463
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,950
safely within that box say that change

464
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,779
these shoulds to musts and say the

465
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,510
revocation method that Acme defines

466
00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:00,610
within that scope the server has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

467
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,908
consider one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these any of these three</font>

468
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,918
keys to be valid Erika suggestion was

469
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:09,340
that we require at least one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

470
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">three um which is a little bit more</font>

471
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,399
limited in terms of burden of places<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

472
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:14,379
the server but it seems all so confusing

473
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:15,789
from the client point of view because

474
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,929
you don't know which of those three a

475
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:21,399
given server<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to support so I'm</font>

476
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:23,020
kind of looking at the ca guys in the

477
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:26,590
room you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be next to the mic if</font>

478
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:28,389
we were to change these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two musts and so</font>

479
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,270
that would require that if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows</font>

480
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,740
up who had it was the issue of the

481
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,260
certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems kind of obvious</font>

482
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,760
but someone who has proven control the

483
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,440
same set of domains in the certificate

484
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,309
or the private<font color="#CCCCCC"> key with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes</font>

485
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,110
with the certificate

486
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:42,519
like would you be willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept</font>

487
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,189
revocation from any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those three</font>

488
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:48,909
entities I don't see any issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

489
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:51,129
these 38 please<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh Clint Wilson did you</font>

490
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">sir I don't see any issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font>

491
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:56,408
these strategies requesting reputation

492
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,159
does that generally match your

493
00:21:56,409 --> 00:22:02,889
revocation practices today yeah outside

494
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the be out of band report mechanisms</font>

495
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:07,840
that don't come from the certificate or

496
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:12,789
the account holder this Maps directly

497
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,959
via counselors ok and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then that's a good</font>

498
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,119
guys I think you already do all these

499
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,860
things yeah Daniel<font color="#CCCCCC"> McCarney we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

500
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,779
infinite all of them so as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

501
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,418
concerned requiring all of these inside

502
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:24,549
me okay so okay so the upshot here is

503
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:25,649
you know will change these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two musts and</font>

504
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:28,450
then it's kind of a take-it-or-leave-it

505
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:29,918
forciers so like either you do all these

506
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,600
things and you get to use acne

507
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,019
revocation or you have to invent your

508
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,580
own revocation thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so people</font>

509
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:39,999
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that um we'll just change</font>

510
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:44,259
those two work two sheds to musts<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

511
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:45,730
resolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks um so there's prison</font>

512
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:47,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">in here that service should validate</font>

513
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,990
should make sure that they kind of like

514
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,669
the you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are eyes that are providing</font>

515
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,450
these contact fields and counselor

516
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:56,590
registered there was some concern about

517
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,090
interoperability impact because there's

518
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,220
not any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the server to advertise</font>

519
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:03,158
what urls might be acceptable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it i</font>

520
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,419
think general practice among<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sea is</font>

521
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:05,889
that have deployed acting so far is it

522
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:08,769
male 2 and tell our kind of the obvious

523
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:11,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones to accept but you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

524
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:14,019
other scheme that some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cas might accept</font>

525
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,850
some might not and if a client wants to

526
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:18,970
use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't know whether given</font>

527
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:21,639
CA is going to accept that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept it</font>

528
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,710
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so there's a request to add some</font>

529
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:25,269
stuff perhaps to the the metadata

530
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,360
section of the directory to indicate

531
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:29,499
what schemes would be acceptable Daniel

532
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,809
I think you'd come in with someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

533
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:33,580
list yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Daniel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> McCartney again so from</font>

534
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:35,019
my perspective I think the the main

535
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,499
criticism here was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was difficult</font>

536
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:40,419
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine whether the contact was</font>

537
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:42,249
invalid or unsupported and I think we

538
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,830
added an arrow type<font color="#E5E5E5"> and supported that</font>

539
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:46,450
seems better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the metadata aspect</font>

540
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:48,100
of it I mean right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec says</font>

541
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,110
that the metadata element in the

542
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,969
directory is May and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if we're</font>

543
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,780
really looking to clear out all the

544
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,810
confusion we would

545
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:57,250
have to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> that normative must and I</font>

546
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,649
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not the only</font>

547
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,230
place where an acne client it's meant to

548
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:04,630
be generalized across multiple acne ca's

549
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll run into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you one feature another</font>

550
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,710
that isn't supported and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

551
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,139
land on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the side of having a simpler</font>

552
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,090
server and a smarter client that's able

553
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,280
to handle those errors<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the other</font>

554
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,649
aspect here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular one is</font>

555
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,110
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is likely to only come out</font>

556
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,630
during account registration and contact

557
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,939
update and so I think the UX downside

558
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,800
you know submitting multiple contacts

559
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:33,760
finding it back that one of them is

560
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:35,350
unsupported not really a big deal Ted

561
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,550
Hardy so there's a general point here

562
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,810
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have multiple</font>

563
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:42,730
different permitted your I schemes you

564
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,870
run the risk of negotiation failure

565
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,740
we're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that are supported by the</font>

566
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,929
[Music]

567
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,870
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one supported by the server do</font>

568
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:55,300
not have an intersection point typically

569
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,550
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> solved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by declaring a mandatory</font>

570
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:01,840
to implement that everybody knows would

571
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:04,330
be supported yes and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a single</font>

572
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,949
one of male 2 is probably sufficient if

573
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:12,449
people want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to mandatory and</font>

574
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:12,450
implement I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have agreed it sorry I</font>

575
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:18,820
reflect to the record that my colleague

576
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:21,370
repertoire<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allah prefers Moz colon as</font>

577
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,570
the second one I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font>

578
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,270
would require a little bit more

579
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,850
discussion the proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interoperable</font>

580
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,379
implementations a few other things but I

581
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,330
think a single MTI is probably

582
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:35,620
sufficient if we do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font>

583
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:37,449
us but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I think that also means you</font>

584
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,570
could for this particular thing although

585
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,550
not only for Daniel's larger point still

586
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:44,159
leave the metadata thing as optional

587
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,300
because you would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the MTI</font>

588
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,530
there may be other cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

589
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,590
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where you wouldn't have an</font>

590
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">MPI I met then the other thing you could</font>

591
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,010
also do is have a little bit of a

592
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,260
negotiation mechanism where if you guess

593
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,730
wrong and provide something that the

594
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,590
server doesn't like and it provides you

595
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,060
back an unsupported scheme mechanism you

596
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,949
should that you could set the server

597
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:06,580
could say here's a list of scheme that

598
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,380
you like in that the arrow stage as

599
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,570
those two yes you could do it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

600
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">both provision and produce and obviously</font>

601
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:19,299
in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server would always</font>

602
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:20,830
include<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nti in that Liz Danny</font>

603
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:22,360
McCartney I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to mention that</font>

604
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we require us that right now let's</font>

605
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:30,549
encrypt only supports<font color="#E5E5E5"> male</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 so I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

606
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:34,450
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the best one to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go so</font>

607
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:36,399
I think the minimum op minimum approach

608
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,610
here seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be just to add male 2 as a</font>

609
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:41,469
minimum required scheme seems like that

610
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:44,080
would address most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the issue here</font>

611
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:49,029
because you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you could always</font>

612
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,830
fall back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just mail to so unless</font>

613
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:53,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks think we need some more metadata</font>

614
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,000
or this negotiation seems like we all

615
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,059
could also add those in extensions in

616
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,350
the future so I'm inclined just to scope

617
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:04,260
down and declare the MTI all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

618
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:08,260
seeing some God so we'll go with that

619
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:11,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next yeah this is this is the</font>

620
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:13,870
the challenging one um so Hugo Landau

621
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,250
observed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

622
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,529
can end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in these situations where I</font>

623
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:21,039
submit an order for certificate has<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

624
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:23,230
names in it I try to go fulfill the

625
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,240
challenges for those names and nine of

626
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,909
them work but in one case the DNS didn't

627
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,889
propagate quite fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

628
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:33,880
challenge failed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorization I</font>

629
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:36,879
got invalidated um in that case right

630
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,830
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best the client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is to</font>

631
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,539
restart the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole order process and</font>

632
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:45,250
create a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> order which consumes a fair</font>

633
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:47,919
bit of server resources um it's not it

634
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:50,350
there's you get some benefit because the

635
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,940
nine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did succeed should carry over</font>

636
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,860
and be reused in the new authorization

637
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:57,100
although that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> guaranteed it's up</font>

638
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,750
some ca's policy and so the question

639
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,120
here is should we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something that</font>

640
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,940
makes that addresses this case a little

641
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,610
more elegantly on Hugo<font color="#CCCCCC"> posited three</font>

642
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:09,130
potential mechanisms one allowing a

643
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:13,840
mechanism for retrying a challenge so

644
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:15,789
that if a challenge if CA tries to

645
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,379
validate a challenge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fails the</font>

646
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:19,389
client could maybe kick the server and

647
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,970
say please retry this challenge we try

648
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:23,780
to validate

649
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:25,820
again um another option<font color="#CCCCCC"> he proposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

650
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,830
to allow challenges to be regenerated so

651
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,230
an authorization comes with a list of

652
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,090
challenges um if one of those gets

653
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,560
invalidated maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give the</font>

654
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,209
client way to say please give me a new

655
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,940
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of challenges just prove that I on</font>

656
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:40,510
this the same domain you could also<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

657
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:43,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar dance at the authorization level</font>

658
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:45,470
letting getting a new authorization for

659
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,969
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> a given order one thing occurs to</font>

660
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,860
me we could also do here is kind of

661
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">address this just from the ca side it</font>

662
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:54,199
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if ca's weren't quite so</font>

663
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:56,720
aggressive about invalidating challenges

664
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,640
if they don't work the first time then

665
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,190
you might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> need somewhat such</font>

666
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:06,080
mechanism here so you know if the worry

667
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:07,790
were things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS propagation it you</font>

668
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,679
might avoid a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these errors if</font>

669
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:12,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ca were just willing to try again in</font>

670
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,510
a couple minutes or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have some</font>

expanding window of retries of

672
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:18,860
validation over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and that</font>

673
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,400
wouldn't require any protocol change we

674
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,389
would we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just add some you know</font>

675
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,270
non-normative recommendation where we

676
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:29,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend ca's retry some of these</font>

677
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:31,030
things in order to allow for clients

678

681
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,880
maybe is we try validation queries that

682
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:45,460
was an outburst<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that this</font>

seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to fix this the</font>

684
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,570
problem is you do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of have</font>

685
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,669
exponential<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-off like try again in a</font>

687

a day or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even up to a week we do</font>

688
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:01,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have some clients who you know</font>

689
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:06,399
create authorizations and then on order

690
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:08,170
and days to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> something oh and the</font>

691
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,630
problem with that is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

692
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,010
window where we pried it at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-hour</font>

693
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,350
mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now you're waiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the one</font>

694
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">day mark for us to try again like that's</font>

695
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:18,580
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for you to debug and you</font>

696
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:24,160
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able to say okay I</font>

697
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:25,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">fixed the thing try it again now you end</font>

698
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting back you try imagine</font>

699
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,050
mechanism was that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would look</font>

700
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:34,030
like I mean if it were something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

701
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:35,770
you know I take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same payload that I</font>

702
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:38,050
are the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah the same payload that</font>

703
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,050
I posted before I Reese I knit and I

704
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:43,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">posted to the challenge again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see a</font>

705
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,879
verifies that it's the same payload and

706
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,530
if so reach drives the validation is

707
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like what you'd be</font>

708
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:55,230
imagining here for the mechanism yeah

709
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:58,420
and so also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is during those</font>

710
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,880
automatic retries by the ca what's the

711
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:04,570
status of the authorization you know

712
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,030
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not invalid yet but most clients</font>

713
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,379
probably you know the straightforward

714
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:10,000
case most clients want to return to the

715
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:15,790
user and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was the error we got</font>

716
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,340
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you fix it it seems like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

717
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,990
could I think my opening offer for that

718
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,240
would be to keep it in a pending state

719
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:25,000
but then have like a list of error

720
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,220
results that the CIA had gotten so if

721
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,380
you observe that the challenge is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

722
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,870
pending but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now it's got an error</font>

723
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,360
attached to it then you can infer that

724
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:36,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ca is not succeeded at validating it</font>

725
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,850
and provide that error back to the user

726
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:43,600
yeah one problem we have then is

727
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:45,520
associated error results with attempts

728
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,719
so you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a list of these</font>

729
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,710
are the error results we've gotten so

730
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,690
far<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

731
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,549
I am just try it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again how does the</font>

732
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,840
client now based on this recent tribe

733
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:57,700
did I get a feta yeah so you want to

734
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,580
like define an order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the air results</font>

735
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:06,809
or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time stamp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

736
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:10,720
yeah that seems pretty lightweight to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

737
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:13,330
you know with the repost and keep

738
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:18,640
pending<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a list of unsuccessful</font>

739
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:22,480
attempts um probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> big enough to</font>

740
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,159
require a new last call but this seems

741
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,770
like a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is likely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up</font>

742
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,380
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people i'm worth resolving so and</font>

743
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:32,620
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that approach seem sensible to</font>

744
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,789
people seeing some nods<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if</font>

745
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,989
there's anybody who objects to this

746
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:37,539
approach now would be a good time to

747
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,799
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will cause us to recycle the</font>

748
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,470
working group last call it's a big

749
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,000
enough change for that so understand

750
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:47,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's a consequence to make this</font>

751
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,880
change I don't see an objection so it

752
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,539
sounds like the next step would be for

753
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,830
the editors to make this change and then

754
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:56,169
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we issue a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group glass</font>

755
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,210

756
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes I think Kevin I should have a</font>

757
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:04,779
triage and land bugs called the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

758
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:09,130
days that's the last one that's there

759
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:11,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">anymore here oh yeah this one um I got</font>

760
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,700
no dog in this fight but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shaunt is</font>

761
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,710
sean leonard in the room he actually

762
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,940
noted on on the mailing list that he had

763
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,549
a conflict for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font>

764
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:24,120
actually ask russ have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed the</font>

765
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:27,908
mailing list discussion of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

766
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,039
well so yes arguing that what we're what

767
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:33,669
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing here is functionally</font>

768
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:36,220
equivalent to doing a text plain

769
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:38,950
encoding and that creating a new listing

770
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,830
for text plain is not sensible and he's

771
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:45,720
suggesting that we go to ad er rather

772
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:48,158
than a pen concatenated de are<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe</font>

773
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,429
so rich do you want to comment from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

774
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">floor on this sure yet yes colleagues</font>

775
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:57,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked with shimano's yesterday um this</font>

776
00:33:54,190 --> 00:34:00,620
two issues one because the other RCT

777
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:03,050
reference in his email phone call<font color="#E5E5E5"> hem</font>

778
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,729
a specific format<font color="#E5E5E5"> that names of the</font>

779
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:07,629
format right that's just an editorial

780
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:10,730
issue the other thing he was suggesting

781
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:14,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we'll have to do a consensus I think</font>

782
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:17,870
is rather than have yeah base64 some

783
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,199
support character encoding on just out

784
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:24,350
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in say any kind of arbitrary gurr</font>

785
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:27,259
order for example the one the one he

786
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:30,469
recommended that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end was used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

787
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,240
TLS certificate lists order it right and

788
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:34,850
put it into a JSON structure so that

789
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,168
you're not serializing this is that lets

790
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:41,949
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ski in any point the</font>

791
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:46,069
counter-argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave to him sorry oh</font>

792
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:49,819
he changed it again oh sorry yeah the

793
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:52,669
counter-argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave was a text file</font>

794
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:54,950
with a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hem sorts in in an order</font>

795
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:58,509
is accepted by the most popular but

796
00:34:54,949 --> 00:35:01,250
breath but servers out there so he's

797
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:03,890
changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for geek aesthetics as</font>

798
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:06,080
opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pragmatically yeah i think as</font>

799
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,819
i recall<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we originally had just</font>

800
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">dürer as the way you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> return or</font>

801
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,810
certificate reason we changed that was

802
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:14,300
for developer friendliness to match what

803
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,680
was accepted as input by most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

804
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,860
industry it turns out there is kind of a

805
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:22,009
de facto standard there and so I agree

806
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:24,470
with rich that I'm hesitant to move away

807
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,880
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that unless there's some agreement</font>

808
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,100
there's some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> state are coming up</font>

809
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,280
so yeah what's the lightest so Carl

810
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:34,940
manor at the latest about two hours an

811
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,820
hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago ish is to take the dirt same</font>

812
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:41,600
format but in between the certs have us

813
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:46,690
quoted as base64 comma-separated you

814
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,690
Jason it appears

815
00:35:46,860 --> 00:36:04,890
yeah yes but still don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

816
00:35:54,220 --> 00:36:10,259
since that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah what</font>

817
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:12,850
what's your name hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erica scroll up I</font>

818
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,480
don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we call it cam or shmem</font>

819
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,860
more quick or whatever but like let us

820
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">use the format that people who've back</font>

821
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:29,619
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> their servers to accept press</font>

822
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:31,540
would you like to chime in on this so it

823
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:34,600
seems the top one pound is highly

824
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,400
offended right I don't care what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

825
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,700
call it if there's an RFC that it calls

826
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:44,830
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen that you can reference the next</font>

827
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:46,899
one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of be flexible</font>

828
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:50,380
in the order which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't believe</font>

829
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,990
perfect and posters second the third one

830
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,180
is to encoding of the same structure

831
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">alone with the mine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> referendum oh yeah</font>

832
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:02,410
yeah I meant the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullet as a</font>

833
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:06,400
clarification first so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing his</font>

834
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:08,589
email um listed that that mind type out

835
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I was just trying to do the</font>

836
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,770
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your favor of saying what does</font>

837
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:15,040
that actually indicate which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sign</font>

838
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:20,100
data struct right degenerate Lunger

839
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:22,540
there's no time yeah yeah we have

840
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:25,299
implementations of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first and the</font>

841
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:28,109
third either one of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with me</font>

842
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:32,440
making up something new doesn't seem to

843
00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:34,960
encourage the whole let's direct the

844
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,670
editors<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix the terminology so it</font>

845
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,630
matches the RFC that was referenced in

846
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:42,760
cozy alright so the proposed resolution

847
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,500
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thornton group at see if anybody</font>

848
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,180
objects to this is to adjust<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

849
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,720
terminology as was originally suggested

850
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,069
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean's first message that's not quite</font>

851
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,200
as simple as changing the mime type

852
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:56,830
there's also some character set stuff

853
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,180
that has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen Jacob book you want</font>

854
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,369
to propose a different resolution or a

855
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:03,180
comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this proposal</font>

856
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:04,970
well yeah comment so very recently on

00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,169
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left in the last like hour or two</font>

858
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:10,200
John<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ray's but I actually thought it was</font>

859
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:12,269
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good point which is that if the</font>

860
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,460
client naively copies the pen

861
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:16,709
certificate chain into a file to be

862
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">loaded by say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet's or patchy which</font>

863
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,269
is what we expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to do it's</font>

864
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:23,669
obvious thing the ca can slip a private

865
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:25,799
key in there and those web servers will

866
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,720
interpret that to say oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should use</font>

867
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:29,970
this private key rather than the one

868
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was configured with so that's</font>

869
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,868
potentially a big issue with lighting

870
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,788
straightforward Pam even though I like

871
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:41,670
the idea of providing what blood servers

872
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:45,390
will use that seems like something

873
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:49,859
perhaps we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should verify empirically yep</font>

874
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:52,230
that sounds so if so perhaps a warning

875
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:54,029
yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I could we call that in</font>

876
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:59,430
the engines or perhaps miles and bugs on

877
00:38:54,029 --> 00:39:01,769
some web servers at there's around

878
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:04,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">already in that most of the web servers</font>

879
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:07,499
will take one name for the cert list and

880
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:10,799
another name for the surfers private key

881
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:13,470
which presumably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clients done so I</font>

882
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:16,799
think calling it out is don't do this is

883
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:18,118
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough all right I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hope</font>

884
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:19,890
that these web servers with regard these

885
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,239
is untrusted input anyway Andy

886
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:24,900
validating there are the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

887
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:26,220
yep so back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the proposed resolution</font>

888
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,940
the proposed resolution here is a

889
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:32,098
textual adjustment to correctly identify

890
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,539
the mime type here which includes

891
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:38,390
character set and the other issues that

892
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:41,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">go along with that and secondarily to</font>

893
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:44,759
investigate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and potentially add text to</font>

894
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:46,828
the security considerations on the

895
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:51,420
insertion of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private key attack which</font>

896
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:52,799
on raised since we are already going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

897
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,630
have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

898
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:56,670
last call that was the previous issue

899
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:00,359
there's still some time for on list

900
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:02,009
discussion of this should folks want to

901
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:04,819
refresh themselves on the apparently

902
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:07,920
changing up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very minute</font>

903
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:10,829
discussion gosh I knew I shouldn't have

904
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,930
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> lunch and we can revisit that</font>

905
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:15,450
resolution on list if there

906
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:24,690
a reason to change everybody ok with

907
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:27,210
that resolution that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh I don't</font>

908
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:30,660
this big things are so does the other

909
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:32,880
items in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda ok yeah so we should</font>

910
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably deal with this issue but can</font>

911
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,240
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this probabilistically much</font>

912
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,520
as I despise ever discussing whether or

913
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:45,118
not promising dairy advice or random um

914
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:49,920
um okay uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt judo that like pick this</font>

915
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:52,079
text I looked at this PR right it didn't

916
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,440
require like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum length so I mean</font>

917
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,359
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to tell people I mean so is</font>

918
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,760
there an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this I could bring up</font>

919
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,940
and although he our number 29<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll</font>

920
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,430
bring it up and I mean so okay prefer to

921
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:07,619
restate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> be it when people generate</font>

922
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:09,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we routinely refer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 128-bit</font>

923
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:10,950
randomly generated values as you do i do

924
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,359
not think that telling that the

925
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,980
pretending that they are not unique is a

926
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:17,970
useful like waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> age of the universe</font>

927
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">um if 160 if you prefer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like have you</font>

928
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:25,618
know a if you're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nasty um</font>

929
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:27,480
so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we specify what</font>

930
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,280
people do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that like if we're</font>

931
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,390
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if we're organism so we're</font>

932
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say they should be unique and</font>

933
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,750
leave it entirely the server discretion

934
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,430
that's reasonable if we're going to say

935
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,020
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be rich suggest a random</font>

936
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,690
narration then we should vacuum and

937
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:43,710
guides now so so a construction like

938
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:47,849
saying that they may either be random of

939
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:49,559
a certain length or more or constructed

940
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:51,990
to be unique seems book could be bought

941
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:54,510
yeah but that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun to me i could</font>

942
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,680
and if you're right this is daniel i

943
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,380
think you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> writing the</font>

944
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,598
texture on this maybe not let's seem to

945
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,339
recall seeing a PR danny mccray no i

946
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,410
think you're confusing it with the token

947
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:07,290
thing i thought oh yeah jacob lew

948
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:08,848
zealots yeah any case<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems like a</font>

949
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:15,119
sensible resolution to me so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we</font>

950
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">can make text that I think yeah oh okay</font>

951
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,099
so it's too slow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys already fixed</font>

952
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,098
it in

953
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:27,140
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we can we can address this</font>

954
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:29,760
so with that river is going to discuss

955
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we will change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to require that</font>

956
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the nonces either be constructed so that</font>

957
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:39,270
they are always unique or if they're

958
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:50,339
randomly generated then they must have a

959
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:52,890
certain length this 128 bits<font color="#CCCCCC"> seguin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

960
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,080
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's on I can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

961
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,279
is it the Nazis or re-hydrate visit

962
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,890
entropy<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

963
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,260
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> number yeah that's fun yeah I</font>

964
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:03,960
if people feel like 160 is important

965
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,619
I've no fee for 160 but liking those of

966
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,619
you to save your work

967
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:23,190
that's not me right that's that's you

968
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:30,330
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea a requirement a big thing</font>

969
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:31,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay oh yes body shaming um okay so yeah</font>

970
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,890
um there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple items raised on</font>

971
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:38,280
the list um one was discussion of

972
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:42,839
whether CAA should be mandatory as part

973
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:44,790
of the validation ah I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

974
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:54,150
to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than let's have a few</font>

975
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:57,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes to discuss that Richard no would</font>

976
00:43:54,150 --> 00:44:01,440
you care to elaborate sir I mean I ready

977
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:03,090
is not the domain it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is not</font>

978
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,270
a level<font color="#CCCCCC"> at which the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> specification</font>

979
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:08,130
addressed cas do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of things</font>

980
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,870
that we have makes you have a list at

981
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:12,120
the back of the spec of additional

982
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:14,250
things beyond acne that is EA's should

983
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,400
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to meet their obligations to</font>

987
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,360
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this</font>

988
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,190
via<font color="#E5E5E5"> net profit for that list I think I</font>

989
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,130
offer them a mailing list to add it to

990
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,840
that list but it's at a comfortable

991
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,490
level and we shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be requiring</font>

992
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,280
things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that level that's that's more</font>

00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:41,370
the scope of something like the cab for

994

parts that's true it said<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ted Hardy just</font>

995
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:45,660
pointing out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the list in fact</font>

00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:53,820
made it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandatory in an in it in a</font>

1000
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,370
document that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> issued in march of</font>

00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">this year as a result the marginal</font>

1002
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:04,049
utility of us requiring it as well seems

1003
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,790
at modest is a good description is there

1004
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:09,000
anybody who wishes to argue at this

1005
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:11,270
point that that modest utility is worth

1006
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,270
it

1007
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:19,230
ok so this maybe not quite as big an

1008
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,580
issue as we thought it seemed good no

1009
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:24,380
one seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sure we put it in the</font>

1010
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:26,520
list at the end asking the chairs for

1011
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:31,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay how do you want to talk to be in</font>

1012
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sector yeah so the customers should</font>

1013
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:38,000
we add this to that list in CA

1014
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:44,040
considerations yeah yeah yeah okay sure

1015
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,840
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do inna sec isn't it ok ya</font>

1016
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,960
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other issue recently</font>

1017
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:55,260
raised on the list was requiring DNS SEC

1018
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:59,010
for domain validation ah frigates

1019
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:01,620
anybody I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any slides I don't</font>

1020
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:04,890
have it I have a dog in this fight but

1021
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's sort of peed on my DNS SEC zone so</font>

1022
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:12,150
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like Victor you're in queue yes</font>

1023
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:16,589
I can hear me yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we don't see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:21,990
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharing video d</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we don't</font>

1026
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:27,180
contention since i think i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one who</font>

1027
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,330
raised this issue that while requiring

00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:32,430
people to sign their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own domains is</font>

1029
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:35,160
perceived quite onerous and many people

1030
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:38,160
haven't that running a validating

1031
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:41,759
resolver is rather routine these days

1032
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:44,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that for folks who have</font>

1033
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,250
signed their domains and are then going

1034
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,620
to be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns challenges to obtain</font>

1035
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:52,410
certificates it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very reasonable</font>

1036
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:56,250
expectation that the ca would do you the

1037
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:58,500
courtesy of validating your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font>

1038
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,450
responses and not accepting forgeries

1039
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,910
from any man in the middle attacks and

1040
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,279
that the burden on the ca of just

1041
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,830
spinning up you know their favorite

1042
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,700
resolver and configuring the trust

1043
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:15,870
anchor is very minimal so I would expect

1044
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:17,910
I think reasonably that the ca can join

1045
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:20,430
the millions of people who use a today

1046
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:23,129
today today tour very science version

1047
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:26,460
and so on and are already using DNS SEC

1048
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:29,550
with no noticeable you know impact

1049

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS a client that the ca would also</font>

1052
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:44,098
mandatory room what I believe your

1053
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:47,460
proposal there and could come<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you</font>

1054
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:50,460
you're proposing that should the

1055
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:56,790
information which comes back from the

1056
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:59,900
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> ed NSX sign then the ca should</font>

1057
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:03,089
validate the signatures but you are not

1058
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:07,109
that it must be so sign is that correct

1059
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:09,810
a correct but a little bit clearer if

1060
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:12,000
the delegation from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parent domains</font>

1061
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:14,190
are ultimately from the root you know

1062
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,650
has DS records so the domain should be

1063
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:21,060
signed then the ca will only accept it

1064
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:26,849
if suitably signed right so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> acca</font>

1065
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:33,049
runs a validating resolver this also

1066
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:33,050
seems like a question for camp form um

1067
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:40,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Acme is very much focused on</font>

1068

automated you know DV with very little

human<font color="#E5E5E5"> intervention a sort of certificate</font>

1070

1071
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,040
appropriate for the kind of mechanisms

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,859
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least consider it Tiffany's come</font>

1073
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,140
as a sort of a similar clarifying

1074
00:48:55,859 --> 00:49:00,150
question are we aware of any CA that

1075
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">would do this check manually if we're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing manual checks now are you aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1077
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:13,049
any CA that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do this in their</font>

1078
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,410
current process or whether manual or

1079
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,410
automated

1080
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:29,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay Victor if this were sent in as a</font>

1081
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,819
suggestion to have forum instead of

1082
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:36,190
handled and acne what would the

1083
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:39,910
functional difference feet I don't know

1084
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:42,930
who the casr who aren't already in camp

1085
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:45,490
forums I'm not sufficiently aware of

1086
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:47,259
what what the difference is in practice

1087
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:49,118
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it just seems to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

1088
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:52,690
you're implementing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> specification</font>

1089
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:55,619
you ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS</font>

1090
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:58,480
challenge or can be verified this DNS

1091
00:49:55,619 --> 00:50:01,030
and if it said multiple times I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1092
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,670
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the harm of saying it multiple times</font>

1093
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:06,220
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I don't really in the previous</font>

1094
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:08,440
topic see the harm of saying that CAA is

1095
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:13,689
mandatory even if cab form already said

1096
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:19,780
so there's no reason not to say so if

1097
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:21,430
it's if it's the case tohon<font color="#E5E5E5"> Baker well</font>

1098
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,920
one question will be whether we're

1099
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:28,990
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a should which I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1100
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,339
easy thing to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a must in ITF bill I</font>

1101
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,558
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this could be a must</font>

1102
00:50:30,339 --> 00:50:34,538
because it isn't actually a necessity

1103
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,730
for interoperation<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I could be</font>

1104
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:39,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">persuaded otherwise the issue I would</font>

1105
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:42,250
see from the cab forum point of view is

1106
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:45,730
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been very very careful to</font>

1107
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:49,539
avoid endorsing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can root as the</font>

1108
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:53,500
root of everything and for us that is a

1109
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:55,619
showstopper because we do not know who

1110
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:59,260
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be running I can in 10 years time</font>

1111
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:02,020
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not run oh who will control it and</font>

1112
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:04,630
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is absolutely no way that we can</font>

1113
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,130
establish an administrative guarantee

1114
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,859
that he'd be running an acceptable

1115
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:13,510
fashion so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that'll be very</font>

1116
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:19,750
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a statement in cab</font>

1117
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:24,210
forum that bcas must be subservient to I

1118
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:27,490
can see a as the root of all things oh

1119
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:29,920
that's why I don't think that's what's

1120
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:31,750
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I think this is a little</font>

1121
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit different in that what he's talking</font>

1122
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:35,310
about is if you're using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

1123
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,190
challenge

1124
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:43,900
um sorry Eric would you like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain</font>

1125
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:46,000
sure well though I I mean maybe the DNS

1126
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,619
challenge that doesn't make any<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1127
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,790
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading this thing says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UD NSX</font>

1128
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:50,530
I'm then it has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the challenges</font>

1129
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:54,910
because they all depend on the DNS for

1130
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:57,849
verification<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's true I mean the</font>

1131
00:51:54,910 --> 00:52:00,899
question is what when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing DNS</font>

1132
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:02,920
set to say that you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check it it</font>

1133
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:06,190
implies you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it against</font>

1134
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,710
some roof at some point and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1135
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:11,530
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> root of all roofing and that's</font>

1136
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:13,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem so let me suggest an alternative</font>

1137
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,119
hear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead love me a little bit of</font>

1138
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,040
progress instead of describing this is a

1139
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:21,339
requirement why don't we write up what

1140
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:25,200
the threat is and include the threat in

1141
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:27,670
the security considerations such that

1142
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:31,390
somebody in the security considerations

1143
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:35,440
sees the potential threat and knows that

1144
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:37,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">if a DNS SEC signed delegation is</font>

1145
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,369
available the threat threat is mitigated

1146
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,020
that doesn't put a requirement on it but

1147
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:42,730
is information to the developer

1148
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,430
community of what the threat is and what

1149
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:47,880
one meeting each other yeah i think this

1150
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:52,210
completely fails to address the issue

1151
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:53,650
you know if I am the if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> own a DNS SEC</font>

00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:58,990
security properties for my domain and

1154
00:52:57,069 --> 00:53:02,310
I'd like anybody petitioning for a

1172
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:51,550
all right it doesn't take

1173
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:53,290
way or step on the toes of any other CA

1174

they're not in the business of

authenticating DNS responses Jacob get

stepped over sharp thanks feel free to

1177
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:09,010
run back so Ted's point about

1178
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,990
documenting the threat here on

1179
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:13,120
mitigations of believe we do you have

texting<font color="#CCCCCC"> security considerations about</font>

1181
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:18,100
such threats and there are some text in

1182
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:21,550
error and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think has been there for a</font>

1183
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:23,860
long time about how you can reduce the

1184
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,710
threat while not the dress gate as part

1185
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:29,680
is the NSF does by doing validation from

1186
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:33,340
multiple vantage points to reduce the

1187
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:35,710
risk of getting that responses um to

1188
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:39,070
Victor's point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's dramatic</font>

1189
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:41,550
overstatement to open sort of this

1190
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:44,710
setback you tips when I think adding a

1191
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:46,360
recommendation for DNS SEC there and the

1192
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:49,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">description of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that counters the</font>

1193
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:53,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">reversals do a fine idea after that that</font>

1194
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:55,480
size if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not already there is that</font>

1195
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:57,550
ok we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and make sure</font>

1196
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,590
it's as good as it can possibly be I

1197
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:02,110
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Victor's point about</font>

1198
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:05,230
expectations of what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could expect when</font>

1199
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:07,270
I sign my domain to say that I expect my

1200
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:08,850
DNS SEC signature be validated before

1201
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">some requests certificate is</font>

1202
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:13,450
unfortunately hugely optimistic in the

1203
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:16,390
world we live in today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm given that</font>

1204
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:20,740
there are a number of CAS out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

1205
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:25,330
a small number of which even are doing

1206
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:26,859
at any flavor of acne today um there's

1207
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:28,720
not really it's not really sensible<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1208
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,790
have an expectation the NSF makes any

1209
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,859
particular difference like now now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1210
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:36,460
we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CAA requirement you might add</font>

1211
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:38,980
a CA a policy that says your ca please

1212
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:41,410
check verify the DNS SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> signature for</font>

1213
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:44,650
you doing that that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be a</font>

1214
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:46,029
fine thing to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we should it might</font>

1215
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:48,490
be worthwhile to write up an extension

1216
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:50,260
of CA to do that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think um you know</font>

1217
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:51,879
given the world we have today and the

1218
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,830
policy landscape today we have today the

1219
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,990
insurance levels we get some days it's

1220
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:58,299
consistent with all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have DNS</font>

1221
00:55:55,990 --> 00:56:01,319
SEC validation be optional as part of

1222
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">this validation process</font>

1223
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:10,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">next or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so yeah we definitely</font>

1224
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,279
we have a normative recommendation for

1225
00:56:10,089 --> 00:56:14,920
DNS SEC Victor said that's not enough I

1226
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:16,240
stand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun view um one thing that</font>

1227
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">might help them form the conversation</font>

1228
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:23,558
let's encrypt does validate dmsx today

1229
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:27,970
so like all the publicly available acne

1230
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:30,549
servers implement this um and so then

1231
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:34,240
the question is but is this the right

1232
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:36,250
lever to get more cas to implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

1233
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">SEC I think if another CA were to</font>

1234
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:40,150
prolong and say we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1235
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:42,940
implement acne but we don't want to

1236
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:45,220
bother validating DNS SEC or more like

1237
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,349
you know if there's some reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why they</font>

1238
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:50,348
don't want it validate the MS sec I

1239
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:52,720
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they won't say wow we want to</font>

1240
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:55,440
implement acne so badly that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1241
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:59,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start melody didn't DNS SEC now um</font>

1242
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,750
they would just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead and implement</font>

1243
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:03,579
acne and ignore this because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1244
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:05,740
actually an interoperability concern I

1245
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:07,539
think more likely hopefully most ca's

1246
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:09,700
are operating validating the resolver

1247
00:57:07,539 --> 00:57:12,119
but I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have data about</font>

1248
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,118
that

1249
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:24,049
Tom Dickinson um I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

1250
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:30,230
victors comment that it was a good idea

1251
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:34,760
to validate and in SF DNS challenge if

1252
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:37,339
possible but I strongly disagree with

1253
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,940
the statement about by<font color="#E5E5E5"> signing my zone I</font>

1254
00:57:37,339 --> 00:57:42,490
have an expectation of everything

1255
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:45,079
everywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my zone will be about</font>

1256
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:49,129
validating that's be unrealistic and

1257
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:57,619
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything in the data spec in a</font>

1258
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:59,450
sec spectral says that generates<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

1259
00:57:57,619 --> 00:58:02,780
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep pretty much but the thing</font>

1260
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:05,569
that John is just said I 1.8<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what</font>

1261
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:07,460
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> validation in DNS sake it's</font>

1262
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:09,829
not necessary to use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones you trust</font>

00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:12,230
anchor from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I can administer fruit</font>

1264
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:14,569
so about the to resolving server could

1265
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:17,030
if it chose to set up a suntrust bank

1266
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:24,579
here in quality of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as realized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1267
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:27,710
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yeah I can just don't get it</font>

1268
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:30,500
sure just quick I certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no</font>

1269
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:33,260
expectation that every dns query from my

1270
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:36,619
domain will be validated what I'm trying

1271

<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Acme cas who might</font>

want to issue certificates from my

1273
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:44,450

that contain the the challenge

1275
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:54,529
verification bits that's it oh sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1276
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:56,089
more thing I I haven't heard yet a

reason why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> CA would not run a</font>

1279
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:05,150
takes more than two minutes to set one

up Phil<font color="#E5E5E5"> hamburger yeah as far as I'm</font>

1281
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:11,540
aware i'm pretty sure that most people

00:59:15,049 --> 00:59:21,349
practices issue and it's a business

1285
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue and we have to be quite careful</font>

1286
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:26,569
about what requirements we have on

1287
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,339
taking trust from other places because

1288
00:59:26,569 --> 00:59:32,269
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our business</font>

1289
00:59:28,339 --> 00:59:35,859
and so whereas we will make a lot of

1290
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:38,479
checks in the real world against

1291
00:59:35,859 --> 00:59:40,788
databases like dun<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Bradstreet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1292
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:44,118
or whatever when we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1293
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:46,369
requirements we do not create a level

1294
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:49,789
that means that we can be forced to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay</font>

00:59:46,369 --> 00:59:52,759
royalties<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dun & bradstreet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

1296

1297

domain name that's verisign sells for

00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,170
six bucks a year so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not an</font>

1299
00:59:58,249 --> 01:00:01,459
organization that I think it's

1300
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,979
completely beside the point Phil could

1301
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:07,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">you stick to the technical point no from</font>

1302
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:09,439
this point from my point of view it is

1303
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:13,670
to the point because you are creating a

1304
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:18,380
technical time that creates a technical

1305
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:25,239
risk for my<font color="#CCCCCC"> business and so whereas you</font>

1306
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:30,079
can check in to the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> level domain DNS</font>

1307
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:32,299
SEC is a particularly objectionable if

1308
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,219
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement to check and it</font>

1309
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:35,329
doesn't say what somebody come come

1310
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:37,880
along and say well you're not checking

1311
01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:41,930
to anchor so it's one of those things

1312
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:44,029
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mase you can say it's easy for</font>

1314
01:00:44,029 --> 01:00:52,549

1315
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:55,660
thing separately I the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1316

trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that focusing this on</font>

1318
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:04,009
actually hurts your earlier and stronger

1319
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:06,589
argument about this is a discussion of

1320
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:08,960
where we're requiring the system to

1321
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:12,279
import trust and I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Victor's</font>

1322
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:15,019
point is essentially that it is the

01:01:12,279 --> 01:01:17,660
person who has<font color="#E5E5E5"> created the DNS SEC</font>

1325
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:25,788
and that person<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like that linkage</font>

to be honored<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the CA and I believe</font>

01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:33,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point that Richard made a few</font>

1328
01:01:29,749 --> 01:01:36,249

valuable extension

1332
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:49,080

thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this practical information</font>

1351
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,130
I was serious this could be a sensible

01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:39,299
thing to add the CIA so that you could

get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expectation uh uh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh No agree</font>

1354
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,380
actually think that was Richard with the

01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:45,870
last call this is victor uh the CIA

1356
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:49,110
suggestion actually might cover it if

1357
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:52,500
CAA could specify don't issue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see anything in CA that</font>

01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:03,120
to check the weather my chosen CA you

know honors DNS SEC it's not sufficient

01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:08,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">because my concern is that some attacker</font>

1364
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:11,310
who is not me might choose some other CA

1365

and that they being a neck me CA no

1366

longer obligated by the spec to check

1368
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:21,150
question of whether i will wisely choose

the a's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> validate it's an issue that</font>

1370
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:28,920
the attacker will choose the least

1371
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:30,720
restrictive see the main problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1372
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:34,340
everything we said right<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is already</font>

been said can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> please humming move on</font>

he turns do not detect sufficient

1375
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:44,670
consensus to even hold a hum so we're

01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:48,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to move on yes we're staying as it</font>

1377
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:49,800
is as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> noted from the previous thing</font>

1378
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:51,330
we are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

working group last call because of the

1380
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:55,589
changes to this so the first question to

1381
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,229
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg</font>

1382
01:03:55,589 --> 01:04:00,450
yet that that's not what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1383
01:03:58,229 --> 01:04:02,489
happen now we have to have at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1384
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:03,989
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reb of the other document and one</font>

1385
01:04:02,489 --> 01:04:07,589
more working group last call before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1386
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:09,839
take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> isg so the working group last</font>

1387
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:11,700
call comments that have come in and the

1388
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:15,390
resolutions we've seen today do seem to

1389
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">us to require</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so re working group</font>

1390
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:20,390
last call p the second item here seems

1391
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:24,450
like our most sensible path board here

1392
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:27,150
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is then the question we will</font>

1393
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:30,419
we after that continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1394
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:33,210
implementations of these changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i</font>

1395
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:35,369
think that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question really is</font>

1396
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:38,489
although these changes are significant

1397
01:04:35,369 --> 01:04:40,890
do we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call them so significant</font>

1398
01:04:38,489 --> 01:04:43,170
that we need for interrupt to be

1399
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:45,089

not demonstrated on any recent draft of

1402
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:52,769
the stack um so I've wonder if<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:54,509
folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> who might be implemented would you</font>

let's encrypt environment right now I

1409
01:05:05,309 --> 01:05:09,089
was kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> closely to draft 03 we're in</font>

01:05:07,589 --> 01:05:16,259
the process of catching that up but

1411
01:05:09,089 --> 01:05:17,819
we're ways off yet and say two months is

1412
01:05:16,259 --> 01:05:20,670
probably optimistic at this place I

1413
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:28,349
don't want to be idea microphone Upton

1414

1417
01:05:33,589 --> 01:05:39,710
timelines are probably similar i would

01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,710
say three months is optimistic

1419
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:59,090
so I guess the question then is given
