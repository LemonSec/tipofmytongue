00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,150
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussions and the discusses</font>

35
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:33,900
have been addressed and the draft is now

in the RFC that's our cue yay<font color="#CCCCCC"> stun path</font>

37
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,420
MTU discovery has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been revised there's</font>

draft will be will be sent to a ESG

40
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:48,510
shortly we just need to do the work and

41
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,940
then stunned<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has been revised three</font>

42
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,970
times there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are quite a few change</font>

43
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,950
I wouldn't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> major changes but you</font>

44
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:01,230
know medium changes medium impact

45
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:03,989
changes and we want to close the

46
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,649
discussion today we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to finish this</font>

47
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:09,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and send is the working class call and</font>

48
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,940
turn this has been refreshed this was a

49
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:17,720
minor refresh and works don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font>

50
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:22,140
done to review the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stunned is diff and</font>

51
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:27,540
think if needed you don't actually know

52
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:31,620
if any work is needed but I see nodding

53
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:35,490
heads so what additional work might be

54
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,620
needed there to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sync was done this I</font>

55
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:45,740
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the chairs update</font>

56
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:45,740
so with that mark yeah any agenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> bash</font>

57
00:04:51,830 --> 00:05:02,580
you have to turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I turn it off we</font>

58
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:08,210
wish a test for you yeah it's a bit

59
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:12,000
unstable<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah it works hello again</font>

60
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:15,719
next slide please all right so last time

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,770
we presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> stunned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this was back in</font>

62
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Delhi I thought there was a lot of</font>

63
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,630
command well not a lot of comment but

64
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:27,150
some some comments were made and we with

65
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,120
my cursor<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonzalo with just started</font>

66
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,770
walking and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found yet another</font>

67
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,570
egg and then another burger and then

68
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,090
adult work and then I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we need</font>

69
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:40,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop to stop there was something</font>

70
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:43,500
wrong and I need to take a bit more time

71
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:49,080
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do complete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis was on 80 cm</font>

72
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:52,050
long term credential mechanism which is

73
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,370
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing which which lounge a</font>

74
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,320
lot in studies so unfortunately it was

75
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,840
just right in the middle of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> move back</font>

76
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,400
to California<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a new job so it took a</font>

77
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,248
little bit at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of time and I</font>

78
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,289
skipped sale

79
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:11,719
so finally I did an ADIZ it was not an

80
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:15,409
LED<font color="#E5E5E5"> son's dundas it wasn't LEDs on start</font>

81
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:19,609
on ever see<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 389 and I found a bunch</font>

82
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:24,589
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> public much I some minor of some less</font>

83
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:27,829
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked her talk with food return</font>

84
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:30,559
which we want to dunk again for<font color="#E5E5E5"> his help</font>

85
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:32,779
on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the surveying some and then we</font>

86
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:36,289
send<font color="#CCCCCC"> a proposal for ELISA was somewhere</font>

87
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:39,739
I can forcibly put the modification in

88
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:41,979
size<font color="#CCCCCC"> as early story police</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also so</font>

89
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:48,558
modification so I will go through

90
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:51,498
quickly we there was some we said

91
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:54,799
delaesh you when packet was<font color="#CCCCCC"> drugged</font>

92
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:57,769
because of an unattached so instead of

93
00:06:54,799 --> 00:07:01,578
having a timeout in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case we cannot</font>

94
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:04,039
read wanted a new signal to the upper

95
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:06,529
layer that said well you are under

96
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:10,699
attack which got me to close<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

97
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:15,349
production a little bit quicker we made

98
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:17,959
something explicit I mean you could

99
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:20,299
deduce how it works and for the people

100
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:24,679
implemented the white where but it was

101
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:28,729
not explicitly stated how to to walk

102
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:31,539
about 400 without authentication my

103
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:36,709
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that usually need to</font>

104
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:41,628
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the step carefully so we did</font>

105
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:45,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we found some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the should we did</font>

106
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:50,919
not make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at all in the document in</font>

107
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:54,529
exam most and some place we make some

108
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:58,128
small in ink improvement even ants and

109
00:07:54,529 --> 00:08:03,979
the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> warms and we are we are</font>

110
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:10,930
trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> peek over into exchange</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

111
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:13,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> oxygens instead of three chosen we</font>

112
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:16,479
so small modification which is I think

113
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,280
some case an improvement in security

114
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,680
which is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have some dings</font>

115
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,979
announced or<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changing the password</font>

116
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,440
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you still out the nonce from the</font>

117
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:27,940
previous time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are still the bus</font>

118
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,919
throughout from the previous time then

119
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:34,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can use it to sign the response</font>

120
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:37,390
instead of sending naked or respond so

121
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:39,760
it's nice so you do it or you don't do

122
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,529
it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it obviously there is a</font>

123
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more security than you can</font>

124
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:48,040
add you cannot before<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so one of the</font>

125
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:51,190
thing was that and only that it was 401

126
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,490
unauthorized which is kind of incorrect

127
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,180
this is not an authorized<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an</font>

128
00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:01,540
authenticated so which one user text

129
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:06,099
turn is doing user separate response

130
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:10,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cody for an authorized different</font>

131
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:14,860
beginner and there were some tags i said

132
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:16,930
you can add an in my message integrity

133
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,050
and some rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> months were clearly there</font>

134
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:23,469
was no no possibility at all to do this

135
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,599
so we remove the possibility so this was

136
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:30,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first aid with the bishop that was</font>

137
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:34,420
probably dash 0 9 so next like this then

138
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:39,450
after fixing like we could at last come

139
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:44,319
back to the issue that that were

140
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:46,720
presented in<font color="#CCCCCC"> darlina so we did at so go</font>

141
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,700
suck on the wound up modification on

142
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,550
dash ten so we remove some silly things

143
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,250
like the other preserve the 0 in the

144
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,920
security orchestrated make sense because

145
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,500
this is a bit sets obviously the horses

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,910
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a bit set except that no</font>

147
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:09,820
be following the recommendation of the

148
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:16,870
working group we said that the minimum

149
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:18,880
potential size for ni 256 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 bytes we</font>

150
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,650
also change the location of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rattle</font>

151
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,110
you have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two choice which was</font>

153
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,920
align with exist

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,729
this is allowing with what other is

156
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:40,719
doing so is not surprised too much

164
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:08,740
track we this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was silly we remove the</font>

165
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,600
truncation from the message integrity

166
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:16,019
this is an old stuff we don't need to

167
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:19,899
care about this this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> out all</font>

168
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:22,300
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world missing recommendation</font>

169
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:27,699
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> well Jonathan we added a link to</font>

170
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:32,649
the secret out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of white subs are cut out</font>

171
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:37,420
two tubes<font color="#E5E5E5"> also this is a COC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font>

172
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:42,839
thanks so yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's an important</font>

173
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:46,029
because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to find and</font>

174
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:49,240
finally this was a response from an

175
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">email from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> early during their lean one</font>

176
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:56,470
of the beginning is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only sent and</font>

177
00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:01,029
we replace the restaurant storage here

178
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:04,809
2018 360 125 and we are dated the text

179
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:11,230
accordingly to explain how to verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

180
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:14,309
domain name from the certificate on and

181
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:19,480
to verify hit against the the Monday

182
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:22,389
next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we did yet</font>

183
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:27,999
another update which is dash 11 which is

184
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:31,029
a last one so I went back for all these

185
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:36,279
things and I am I fixed a little bit

186
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:38,019
more stuff so first one is kind of abuse

187
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,709
is to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should use</font>

188
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:45,459
same type of ash marking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsequent</font>

189
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:47,319
collection that are used but again we

190
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:52,059
really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spell it out these things</font>

191
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:54,248
clearly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last one dress one is a</font>

192
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:56,139
little bit more it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit as it</font>

193
00:12:54,249 --> 00:12:58,329
was from a suggestion from someone I

194
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:02,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't remember if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was in</font>

195
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:05,290
darling so add to this version we used

196
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,749
what we call the nonce cookie only when

197
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,988
we needed it so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nonce cookies are</font>

198
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:14,790
small cookie that we had in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

199
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:17,619
nonce to say we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some additional</font>

200
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:20,259
security properties that you want we

201
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:22,509
want to use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

202
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:26,559
beginning which was a possibility to

203
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:29,889
change the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm and then</font>

204
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:34,689
we added a subtle one which was to be

205
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:35,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to ash username alright so the</font>

206
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,049
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is that you have an</font>

207
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">exponential number and increase of the</font>

208
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:44,670
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cookie with the itu-r for</font>

209
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,929
possibility you need for cookies well

210
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,839
exactly because you don't use this year

211
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:53,860
so instead of doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what we did</font>

212
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">we did is that we added for which four</font>

213
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,319
characters to the coquito between the

214
00:13:56,439 --> 00:14:02,799
cookie and the non sir we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

215
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:07,449
out there which is 24 bits when it's

216
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:11,290
connected from base64 which gives us 24

217
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:13,599
bits of additional security properties

218
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,519
that you can choose in in the future we

219
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">created the registry for that and we</font>

220
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,110
allocated the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first to date so those</font>

221
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,720
bitches for and if you want to use

222
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,269
password algorithm and also long dick is

223
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,079
if you want to use user hush you want to

224
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:32,199
wash<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> username so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next step was</font>

225
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:35,229
well why don't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> send always the nonce</font>

226
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:39,609
cookie even before zero value in the bit

227
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:45,220
set to signal that we support and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mi to</font>

228
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:49,450
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we support the new ashmac based</font>

229
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:53,230
on the night sure 250

230
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:56,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">six so now you always send the nonce</font>

231
00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:01,780
cook cook cook<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you know</font>

232
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:05,020
immediately understand this client knows

233
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,689
immediately that the server is also

234
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,540
austin<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk Ryan and do not have to send</font>

235
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:14,770
both the message integrity and the

236
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:18,579
message integrity 256 to the server so

237
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:21,100
we the first the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a little</font>

238
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:25,170
bit simpler for both the client and the

239
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:29,710
server but now if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use any of</font>

240
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:31,780
the security properties then you just

241
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,540
send a bit set that<font color="#CCCCCC"> contain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

242
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:39,910
other side this is why we remove it also

243
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:45,160
konser register so that was always done

244
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:49,630
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is occur on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> current set so</font>

245
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:52,000
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are so there is still too small I</font>

246
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:59,080
don't know they will tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me things that</font>

247
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need to fix and so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you come up the</font>

248
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,990
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> type is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we talked about</font>

249
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:08,230
this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked a lot about this and we</font>

250
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:11,470
decide that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I would like one</font>

251
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:14,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">last time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself mark before</font>

252
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,270
you go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would like really to close</font>

253
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,280
these issues right so let's focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

254
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,930
closely not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through and as</font>

255
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,150
you know it happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> in many working</font>

256
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,459
groups so so please you know each of the

257
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,140
issues let's give it a thought and we

258
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,180
will only postpone it if there's really

259
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,130
need to happen something else like more

260
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:36,370
information otherwise we would like to

261
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:38,680
really make the decisions today so some

262
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:46,180
something bad happened with shower is

263
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:48,339
just recently which kind of make me not

264
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:52,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">coping I as I skipping that we are doing</font>

265
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:54,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right things I am or we had a long</font>

266
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:59,349
dist description the computer or<font color="#CCCCCC"> neither</font>

267
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we think that the ing maybe not</font>

268
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,070
completely at ease with the things we

269
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,500
are doing so

270
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,800
and I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this because I</font>

271
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,050
know if some of you went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font>

272
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,869
tutorial on Sunday which by the way was

273
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:16,540
very interesting and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one slide</font>

274
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:24,819
that said to do not do exactly what we

275
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:27,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">are doing so well so so they said use</font>

276
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:35,490
agility do not use a disc changer

277
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:39,669
sagittis so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use agility for</font>

278
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:42,040
algorithm do not use a beef shank the

279
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:44,680
algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is using a protocol</font>

280
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,120
which made exams so the thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

281
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,970
went back to the mailing list and

282
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,010
everybody more or less a great such as

283
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,910
was the right thing to do keep it simple

284
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:57,640
for what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now it</font>

286
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,350
we said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we said not okay i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

287
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:10,120
know i just wanted to our last

288
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:13,600
preemptive question which is do we still

289
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:17,409
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this or not and i would like</font>

290
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to add one small thing so this thing was</font>

291
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,890
difficult to design and to do and the

292
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,900
reason is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could not find a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

293
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:31,120
guidance so those be done attack

297
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,070
Google's crust and there is not people

298
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,720
talk about this but that will explain

299
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:50,530
kind of farm work how<font color="#E5E5E5"> together Madonna</font>

300
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:53,710
attack so please do to me that's not an

301
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:57,010
area which is really well explained on

302
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:59,200
my lands in any way we like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put this</font>

303
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,210
questioning in front of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would we</font>

304
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,000
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this way do we want to</font>

305
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,100
charge another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> make mending</font>

306
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,860
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this so just after the</font>

shower attacking the project which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

308
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:19,340
part is the biggest user of shower ashes

309
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:21,289
and the people engaged after to say well

310
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought we should do something I and</font>

313
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:37,668
32 62-56 we are doing shots ooh 256 so

314
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:39,559
are we doing the right thing where do

315
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:43,009
you want me to go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the end when</font>

316
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:45,979
we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about this or we be open so</font>

317
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:49,639
um let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see fixing one inch at a time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

318
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:51,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">think so i would like to hear from you</font>

319
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:54,258
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do your mother stood so mark i</font>

320
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:57,228
mean in because the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a</font>

321
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:59,659
solution if you put forward a proposal<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

322
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,489
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would work better my proposal</font>

323
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:06,889
is to do nothing and to keep what we

324
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:10,099
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what we are is that we are</font>

325
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:12,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving in this draft to shut 256 and we</font>

326
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:16,479
will do an extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this in six</font>

327
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:20,029

originally in FSC 53 889 sol<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonzalo so</font>

330
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:31,070
the reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this is an</font>

331
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:34,429
issue is that we've made this decision

332
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:38,418
before right I mean we decided that we

333
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:43,849
would stick with shall one so no church

334
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:46,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">I hope not not we stick you shall on</font>

335
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:49,340
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> students which site was shut it but</font>

336
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:52,599
the idea here though is do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

337
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:56,509
revisit that decision simply to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

338
00:20:52,599 --> 00:21:01,330
essentially to prevent with what we

339
00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:01,330
think we're anticipating from the iesg

340
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:10,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brandon Williams thump I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I recall the</font>

341
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:12,979
meeting where we came to the conclusion

342
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:16,220
that we should stick with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this my</font>

343
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:19,539
recollection is I was in a very very

344
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:23,450
small minority I'm the group at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

345
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:26,919
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> said we should deal with a bit</font>

346
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,810
down stop and deal with forward agility

347
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:33,350
but if the argument

348
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:36,470
has it changed if it's really just you

349
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:39,800
know that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

350
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:44,570
argument at the time was well it's just

351
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">as much work to add another option type</font>

352
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:51,710
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stun registry as it is to add</font>

353
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,899
another hash type to some other registry

354
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,450
that you would set up and let's wear a

355
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,440
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to piggyback easily on a</font>

356
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:01,970
registry that already exists so if

357
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,200
fundamentally it might just be a

358
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:07,820
question of you know registry management

359
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,310
overhead at least I think that's what

360
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,139
the opinion was at the time my opinion

361
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,870
hasn't changed i still think we should

362
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,010
build it into the protocol but I

363
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">recognize them in a minority there and</font>

364
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:22,220
I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know push that I</font>

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:26,800
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be surprised if security review</font>

00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:32,900
from out of the iesg enclosed is it and

ok morrow so<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong clinics I mean so</font>

the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I mean for what we're</font>

376
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,050
know it's you're less likely to have a

break that his belt<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same time um</font>

378
00:22:53,050 --> 00:23:03,740
I feel like um I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually are bits</font>

379
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:06,290
our half agility right now it's pretty

380
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,090
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean maybe I need to review it at</font>

381
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,420
I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have worked through all</font>

382
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:14,750
of this to sort of say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is all</font>

383
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:17,410
right until and we have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

384
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:22,640
absurdly to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term some of the</font>

385
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:25,220
cookies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're so remember we have a</font>

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:32,710
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea Doug protection for</font>

388
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:35,750
this we don't have activity for the

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,840
message integrity<font color="#CCCCCC"> SH which is integrity</font>

390
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:41,360
of the message itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> act and there is</font>

391
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,030
ignoble I mean I think that why we chose

392
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,100
the name of the new thing

393
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,720
yeah its integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot it would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

394
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,340
by saying he could have message

395
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,400
integrity and he has already want

396
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:53,980
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the finder and for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

397
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:58,960
yeah yeah yeah you got the geo jenny

398
00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:02,520
teased by genetic diversity by defining

399
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,650
a new ticket<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this I</font>

400
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,960
don't see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would gain by saying</font>

401
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:10,450
we're going to put those additional bit

402
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,520
of sake what Hatcher algorithm it is in

403
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,250
the message integrity into a mess

404
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,500
integrity active<font color="#CCCCCC"> so just you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know get</font>

405
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,880
another registry and get another n bits

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,930
field<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's take those space and</font>

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,560

now we have to come up with a fourth

revision that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now we</font>

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:04,060
trying to see what's the how is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

422
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,670
different from saying we're going to

<font color="#CCCCCC">define a patch ability by putting it in</font>

putting big you're still good happy to

425
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,760
find hey use this algorithm whatever

426
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:15,220
this is this is the registry for that

427
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,140
mean I mean maybe I mean if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

428
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,500
say okay here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lighter-weight</font>

437
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,010
having a somewhat more general

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,160

440
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,460
doesn't i think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone changed</font>

how they look on the wire<font color="#E5E5E5"> this team so</font>

442
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,660
it's documented and makes the work for

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,060
defining a new message integrity shot

444
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,559
three or<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever slightly less harm and</font>

445
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,210
that's not unreasonable

446
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,980
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would have had that more</font>

447
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:03,850
emphasized in the document is their

448
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:06,940
version of 'deck exactly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I I got</font>

to say exactly what Jonathan<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to it</font>

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:17,289
approach for hash agility that the thing

452
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:19,960
that name is missing from the document

453
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:21,549
is a clear statement of this in our

454
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,529
approach and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you want to add</font>

457
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:32,469
necessary to convince those the quantity

458
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,840
a hash agility approach that we actually

459
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:39,220
have that covered ya gonna do an

460
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:42,820
eligible that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tumor good good way to</font>

461
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:45,789
do this yeah so we have a GD t by doing

462
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:52,689
a new document which<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

463
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:58,389
decent Adam day it's all I I think that

464
00:26:52,690 --> 00:27:01,299
documentation may need to cover the<font color="#CCCCCC"> half</font>

465

negotiation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear it down as a lot</font>

466
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:06,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes as well yeah so the idea is how do</font>

467
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:08,820
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn this to our vertex we were</font>

how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next level so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

471
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,799
to modify this to explain now on but how

472
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:26,499
would we fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> why did you it seems</font>

473
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:29,700
reasonable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me my mind will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be quick</font>

474
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:33,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm Spencer darkens the responsible yd</font>

477
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,269
any director that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think will accept</font>

478
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:48,399
requests for early review if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all</font>

want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to short-circuit long</font>

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:55,389
conversation at IHG evaluation time that

481
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:57,248
may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good thing to do report</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

482
00:27:55,389 --> 00:28:03,360
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has a guillotine</font>

483
00:27:57,249 --> 00:28:09,070
plan in the document right now yes i

484
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:11,850
will remove the highlighting yeah so I

485
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,850
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

486
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">for what we've lost the edge of you so</font>

487
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:25,470
sorry yeah yeah yeah this is yeah let me

488
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:29,620
yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they this was it</font>

489
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:31,990
showing so weird actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> postal your</font>

490
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:36,669
bookmarks I partner yeah maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Larry</font>

491
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:40,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay i'll bug right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

492
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:45,100
that ok they were done yeah I feel like

493
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:46,720
yeah I think that's reason alone we also

494
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">will hopefully to make sure that the</font>

00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:58,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a my 76 is it's also submission in</font>

497
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,980
general for you know why you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> read</font>

498
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:04,210
bit down for future a shock where this

499
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:07,390
as well yes question I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like suggestion</font>

500
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:09,490
because she's a very album right so you

501
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,490
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> bugs away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand it is that this</font>

502
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:15,760
draft as it is doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent bit down</font>

503
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:19,720
at all and the way to prevent bit down

504
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,920
is with a later draft or later RFC that

505
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,900
would say do not use<font color="#E5E5E5"> sha-1 anymore and</font>

506
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:30,550
then you just go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your server</font>

507
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:37,000
configuration or what whatever if you

508
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:40,270
refuse to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it I i think this this one</font>

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">get given the mechanism as its described</font>

510
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:46,150
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think protection against pitt</font>

511
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:49,360
downs does require that you have an

512
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:52,180
orderly process of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got you now I</font>

513
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,459
deprecated one then I add another one

514
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:57,010
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward that way but if</font>

515
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,650
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiplicity that are allowed</font>

516
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:01,660
it just gets more and more complicated

517
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:06,130
to make sure that you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

518
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:08,740
covered yes Jonathan Ive tonight I think

519
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:11,230
and but there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice big down</font>

520
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:14,290
as I understand it is the case where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

521
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,700
know both<font color="#CCCCCC"> sides want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the new hash</font>

522
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,560
algorithm but some attacker in the

523
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,420
middle is forcing the good undo it all

524
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,590
right so it by the size doesn't want to

525
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,380
use the new one it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit down</font>

shift back peplum sew as

527
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:30,320
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we for mi 56 / say we have</font>

00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,940
a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good story for long-term</font>

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,310
production of positive of your

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:39,020
confidential I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how well it</font>

531
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:41,419
currently generalized I think some of it

532
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,560
is do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> binocs cookie and</font>

533
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,420
whatnot because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have your</font>

534
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,649
short hair so will I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

535
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:52,550
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> again so for stroke them what would</font>

536
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:55,010
you say that the eyes people use csdp to

537
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:58,940
explain you have a nice tubular styling

538
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:01,100
that you have either SBP or a guest on

539
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,440
attorney or I next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I'm signaling</font>

540
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,240
we're so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cleveland obviously</font>

541
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,170
then these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> tickling opponent</font>

you know commits you enough means chair

546
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:23,540
sleep dragged me to review this for

547
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,460
understanding have a bit done works look

548
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,830
at that I think the long term is really

549
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:32,840
good so many support basin for<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

550
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:38,419
unless enough Brandon Williams again um

551
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:41,810
isn't am I remembering correctly that

552
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:45,790
with the Shah 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> sha-256 the thing that</font>

553
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:48,490
protects against bit down is the the

554
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are we calling it the nonce cookie</font>

555
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:55,790
and once we've gone beyond one and

556
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:58,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything is delivering the nonce</font>

557
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:03,200
cookie what will protect against bit

558
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:05,510
down for 256 to sha sha 22 shot three or

559
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever if everything is it's a really</font>

560
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:12,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">good fun probably a new cookie so probs</font>

561
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,350
we need north of cookie bit soft<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

562
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:18,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">cause the additional security so yep</font>

563
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,730
first we can use a big way yeah it's a

564
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:27,710
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea yes you can use a bit which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

565
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:30,650
where the stunts Terrell all right way

566
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:33,160
to think of you so I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

567
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,540
this is some terrific neck system

568
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,230
Quattro behold two everything I don't

569
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,230
know any Latin that

570
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,170
so and as yeah but it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

571
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,380
you can have a bit in the field which

572
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,990
means you know hey I support trial three

573
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,510
yeah you know and if your agenda I

574
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,830
support sorry I expect we expected this

575
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,230
carrier<font color="#CCCCCC"> chaudhary if you see it</font>

576
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,990
something that's not Joffrey in here we

577
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:05,150
unhappy yeah but again that's only

578
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:08,620
that's that's the not so that's only

579
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:11,390
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no no it's only long-term</font>

580
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:13,399
Lorenzo short term can be only protected

581
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:17,630
by an external things because you don't

582
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:22,580
have time to learn leadership things

583
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:27,200
right which I mean that basically have a

584
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:29,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">total debt forever so protecting the</font>

585
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,030
russian dressing only that meaning I hey

586
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:36,290
I expect you know I support<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Sasha</font>

587
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:38,660
already got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this algorithm here so we</font>

588
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:41,240
probably need to explain a little bit

589
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,610
more in this section how this will work

590
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:47,900
for future reference so we need to

591
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:54,469
expand as it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Whizzer not taker or okay</font>

592
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:57,380
and we will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the oh yeah i</font>

593
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:00,230
think the concerns you see that yeah

594
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so concentrate is that why i cannot</font>

595
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,400
call the consumption a little bit but

596
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,720
this game summarized here and the

597
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning of the discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

598
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:12,220
understanding is that we keep things as

599
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:16,040
they are so we keep our pseudo activity

600
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:19,638
by letting people<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a new</font>

601
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:22,969
specification that will define a new

602
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">attribute and which sounds the text in</font>

603
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:32,719
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russia Tiki plan to explain how this</font>

604
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:34,490
will be there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet and we can define</font>

605
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,480
all different we will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> define a</font>

606
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:40,080
new bit in incidents but registry for

607
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,469
this

608
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:46,400
and though everyone should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

609
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:49,649
and I would include in that

610
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:53,040
understanding Spencer's good comment of

611
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:57,960
passing yeah whatever we document their

612
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,720
past sector for early review before we

613
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,090
get to the point we<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly want to</font>

614
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">make all the modification we can this</font>

615
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:10,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">time before the end of this meeting and</font>

616
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:13,860
send everything to clear or view at the

617
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:15,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">AG and tutor working group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then</font>

618
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,000
then we will wait for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rewrite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

619
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:21,510
dress and before asking for any early

620
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,940
review okay so everyone opposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

621
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:28,620
way forward please hum ok so then yeah

622
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,540
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can move forward with that by the</font>

623
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">way when when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mark doesn't remember what</font>

624
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,960
we have discussed and he goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

625
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:35,790
recordings everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you guys are</font>

626
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,500
saying outside the mic you know it would

627
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:40,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be captured so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be</font>

628
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful to to try to use the mic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

629
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:54,640
on let me go to the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

630
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:59,080
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last one so but it's ah so</font>

631
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,080
[Laughter]

632
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:09,690
so but back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Berlin some things have</font>

633
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:13,890
better not naturally this was a only saw

634
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:17,610
the email which was well you need to do

635
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:28,140
something about a key I didn't call it

636
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:31,140
stone<font color="#E5E5E5"> body so um we were we didn't know</font>

637
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,990
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see did an</font>

638
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:38,819
analysis of all the case I know what we

639
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:41,479
do I adopt so lunch with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we gave us</font>

640
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:47,250
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> rice and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked with her</font>

641
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:50,100
Jonathan yesterday I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about this so</font>

642
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,440
the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the analytics thing</font>

643
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:55,650
is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stunting is the stern usage</font>

644
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right it's not really stunned by</font>

645
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:02,580
itself not the mechanism it's how you

646
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:05,040
use them that start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have issues when</font>

647
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:09,299
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you reserve the man named you</font>

648
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:15,029
receive one or more ipv4 advice and one

649
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:18,960
or more<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advice smart so I found</font>

650
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:23,540
three cases so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one is more or</font>

651
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,540
less everything which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to it</font>

652
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:44,040
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> IPA board doesn't really make sense</font>

653
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:47,370
when it's used with ice or where its use

654
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,310
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea and the reason for this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

655
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:52,770
but let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start with eyes with eyes we</font>

656
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:55,080
already have a mechanism which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

657
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,960
select between an ipv6 and ipv4 address

658
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:02,490
why this is what among other things ice

659
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:05,520
is about you prioritize ipv6 before I

660
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:08,430
ipv4 you check the connectivity

661
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:15,120
automatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> give give you what is a</font>

662
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:17,430
current best path so using this and you

663
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:21,690
don't really have inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes when you</font>

664
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:28,950
are well you can get done and I will

665
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:31,590
explain but it's kind of difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

666
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:35,250
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two different algorithm all right</font>

667
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:36,870
if we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> at IPL eyeballs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the</font>

668
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,310
first selection which is done<font color="#CCCCCC"> by eyes</font>

669
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:41,009
and then you have a second algorithm

670
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:44,430
which shows what is the connection to

671
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:47,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">use underneath so it's kind of a complex</font>

672
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:50,549
fix but all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these thing comes from one</font>

673
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,710
thing which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you look at the</font>

674
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,560
sea liner or when you look at the

675
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:59,550
conical line you can put an IP address

676
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">an ipv4 and ipv6 advice and I piggies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

677
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:06,330
advice

678
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:09,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe but you can also put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a domain name</font>

679
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:13,830
all right its authorized not by Isis

680
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:16,710
authorized by the PTSD<font color="#E5E5E5"> plc to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

681
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:22,319
domain name here not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people use</font>

682
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:23,880
this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still here so what we</font>

683
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,510
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed and we cannot do</font>

684
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:31,710
this in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this place but there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a friend</font>

685
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:35,100
in ice beasts that are revising eyes and

686
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:37,830
one solution that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people we</font>

687
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:40,710
talked to the thing with business based

688
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:43,740
solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

689
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:47,100
have ice to to say when don't do this

690
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:50,009
you cannot use a domain name inside the

691
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,140
Salina and inside the candidate when you

692
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,840
are doing ice because your<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

693
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:58,080
mechanism to deuces so in this case it

694
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:01,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">would solve or public and we can do this</font>

695
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:05,910
in nice too because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new protocol</font>

696
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:09,720
yes you wanted to say something called

697
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:12,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">marketing and we do some hacks when we</font>

698
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,109
wanna and after HTTP practice where we

700
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:32,220
can write<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we can get back to that</font>

701
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:36,240
then Schwartz google so similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

705
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:47,010
situation where it's it can be logical

706
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:51,029
to use a domain name as your endpoint

707
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:53,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifier and I I tried and failed to</font>

708
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:57,930
get a draft through that would create a

709
00:40:53,250 --> 00:41:00,450
an explicit mode for turn to allocate to

710
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:02,879
allocate a remote endpoint based on a

711
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:05,189
domain name and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to be able to</font>

712
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:12,870
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again so I hopefully it won't</font>

713
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:13,960
get cut out entirely um shot life and I

714
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,630
work

715
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,510
say is how I said I mean how ice

716
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:23,800
behaviors<font color="#CCCCCC"> not something that is not this</font>

717
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:25,660
working this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah so I mean and I</font>

718
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,010
think this and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can come up</font>

719
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,348
with even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to leave the main</font>

720
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:33,160
name is a you know you know your local

721
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:34,599
candidate cetera type so parative be for

722
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,279
a dress you looked up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your be</font>

723
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,869
four candidates or the v6 letters he

724
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,820
looks ugly racist and eggs or whatever

725
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:41,500
it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> more complicated mess it's</font>

726
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">more nice but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

727
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">could be probably dealt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with effectively</font>

728
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,710
treated as multiple remote candidates

729
00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:55,690
but that nice a problem then so I think

730
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:58,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't resolve it no um I like this so</font>

731
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:01,390
the other case is the seat keeper I

732
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,920
which is much inside ice but I think

733
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:06,160
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue because I already</font>

734
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:08,530
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what kind of motor car what cannot</font>

735
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">transport the youth so it is not an</font>

736
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:14,320
issue so your proposal would be led the

737
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:16,569
ice people<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with it which by the</font>

738
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:27,339
waist<font color="#E5E5E5"> Semin so we left for town but we</font>

739
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:31,300
will get to this thing's also here um if

740
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:32,940
we do that I mean I figured they're

741
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:36,580
released need to be some text here

742
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,770
around what ice is going to do so if ice

743
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,750
does nothing or they screw it up or what

744
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,490
I mean what impact does that have does

745
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:45,220
here we don't really have to say

746
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:49,598
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the ice is H are not</font>

747
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:52,419
defined in system processes it's we the

748
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,400
only usage we are busy busy edges out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

749
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,470
here it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bidder yes we have to say</font>

750
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">something for this but no we don't</font>

751
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:04,720
really have to say anything for eyes I

752
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:06,760
think yeah oh yeah there's ice craft

753
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:12,279
although I steal back Tenace which

754
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:21,240
actually started out<font color="#E5E5E5"> as ice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I have</font>

755
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:21,240
two eyeballs fries and yeah I'm not that

756
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:32,780
I'm not sure whatever that covers this

757
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:35,240
problem but it does so I didn't after it

758
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:37,370
doesn't but follow this problem is not

759
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:45,410
drunk lesser it's not actually that hard

760
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:47,690
then if we know it i think it is Isis

761
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:49,819
problem with a solvable problem I think

762
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:52,130
you know maybe just hate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say Musa</font>

763
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:55,580
just need to explain how they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

764
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:59,330
you know we need to be 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding the</font>

765
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:04,610
users stun usage list of things to do

766
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:07,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">and tell us exactly added yes names for</font>

767
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:17,720
any reason Klingon you do you know

768
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:20,600
models are exposed so do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we agree to let</font>

769
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:25,939
the ice people<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out and we don't</font>

770
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:33,520
say anything but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what Jonathan said so</font>

771
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:36,590
anyone opposed to that way forward and

772
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,509
noe<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gonzalez</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay no not opposed at all</font>

773
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,040
but we should have some sort of

774
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,540
important to make sure that we circle

775
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,720
back with the ice Cubs that they

776
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:48,920
actually do something oh yes i agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

777
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,480
very solvable time she gets off so we

778
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">were synchronizing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show us to</font>

779
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,870
present to do to say the same thing in

780
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:58,759
the music on south bay<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think so we</font>

781
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:03,040
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before which so as to</font>

782
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,940
say Chandrakala mine well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

783
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,470
Jonathan I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you'd like I</font>

784
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,830
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> either people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna keep with</font>

785
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:12,529
domain names<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's solvable problems but</font>

786
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:13,640
I think there's a mic the other person

787
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,530
who the object is chris here because

788
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,379
it's easy s do work to adequately<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

789
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,750
stuck but i don't feel good actually

790
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:23,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so then i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we</font>

791
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:25,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">would need to sort of be like again is</font>

792
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,609
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the use of the music</font>

793
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,650
requirements mention mrs. list<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

794
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:33,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's let's make sure we keep crystal</font>

795
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,070
in the dark

796
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:38,130
actually make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> three steps and</font>

797
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,350
total area as well so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

798
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:47,460
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know get the feedback from</font>

799
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:49,560
the iseries working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay gonzalo</font>

800
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that realizes though I</font>

801
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the discussion had with sue house</font>

802
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,509
for the changes for iced stp or no

803
00:45:54,810 --> 00:46:00,060
longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> valid I mean based on what ends</font>

804
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:03,720
know that something like yes I will

805
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,880
topics with<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so the second</font>

806
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,700
line is what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anyway</font>

807
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,850
because this is the stern usage well one

808
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:14,250
of these is described inside this up

809
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:17,549
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see and the other one exactly</font>

810
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:19,980
the same so it's relatively simple there

811
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:23,310
with I audio from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the place where to</font>

812
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:25,920
charge it the right thing with not

813
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:30,140
discovery that we use binding binding is

814
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">an miss it what it impotent required</font>

815
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,960
transaction which means we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send as</font>

816
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,890
many as we want we are not breaking

817
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,980
anything and we have some use case at

818
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:44,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jonathan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explain to us it gets yesterday</font>

819
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:49,710
so it will be 0 actively<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple walk</font>

820
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:52,890
to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to towards the text to the soul</font>

821
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:59,670
is certainly do the booze Arctic unless

822
00:46:52,890 --> 00:47:04,020
there is question or people a question

823
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:05,760
on discussed I mean c'mon technically

824
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,640
you should make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the colorful sorry</font>

825
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,930
director might be headin to make sure to

826
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,270
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're standing</font>

827
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:15,419
on before doesn't mean you won't get a

828
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:18,060
v6 as your as your discovered address or

829
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:21,090
vice versa so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might be blind</font>

830
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,860
a 46 enters it for them but yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

831
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:25,500
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly framing the ice cases the</font>

832
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,540
terminal allocated your candidates for

833
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,850
all your interfaces and then let some

834
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,250
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some be six so you send to the</font>

835
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:34,230
v4 stunts address from before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it'll</font>

00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">be nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them address in 36 and that's</font>

837
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:39,420
easy and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want you need to set</font>

838
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:42,630
it from all your interfaces anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font>

839
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,820
will not take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to deal with you</font>

840
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:47,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so but so it</font>

841
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,710
remember to do and so the last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

842
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:52,259
difficult one is the point because the

843
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:58,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is that another case in turn is</font>

844
00:47:52,260 --> 00:48:00,570
not a dedenne potent collections HW send

845
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:05,730
navigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests and you can receive</font>

846
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">a pot and and it could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be or not an</font>

847
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:14,430
issue I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I don't know so it's a nice</font>

848
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:17,340
progression to the next discussion and

849
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:19,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">we think that this is a term of them and</font>

850
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:24,870
they should think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll to fix this thing</font>

851
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:27,480
i I don't know there is some year before

852
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:30,240
some with Simon but we think that this

853
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:33,360
is anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> Transfiguration and with the</font>

854
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,240
text other<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Stanley's are saying</font>

855
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:40,560
yeah you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this and we</font>

856
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:43,529
are covered is there any comment on the

857
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:45,960
term<font color="#CCCCCC"> use edge or if inglot we should be</font>

858
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:49,260
what is the proposal exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> he can</font>

859
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:53,250
summarize it is to do nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stood</font>

860
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:58,020
just updated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stern usage saying any</font>

861
00:48:53,250 --> 00:49:01,020
usage from now say<font color="#CCCCCC"> something about API</font>

862
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:03,750
Bible and then we add this to the list

863
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:06,210
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to do zombies okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

864
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:11,610
let's still think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what would go</font>

865
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:14,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and turn this there's never come so</font>

866
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Allen's and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people from yeah so uh I</font>

867
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:21,090
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ideas on well so first thing</font>

868
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:23,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that they can design an extensions</font>

869
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:26,850
which is an identifier which is command

870
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:29,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to request and then there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is only</font>

871
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:31,080
one allegation on the other side<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

872
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:33,839
one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not use you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can adjust</font>

873
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,330
all those projects on and so located

874
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">only one time also the discussion and</font>

875
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:40,170
firm this comes right up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and it was</font>

876
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:42,810
this is your last light so let's wrap

877
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:46,410
this up and we're anything else on

878
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:47,850
Sunday yeah the last thing is so i think

879
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the summary point of this whole</font>

880
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:53,040
slide is based on allies email do we

881
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,080
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on so here this is</font>

882
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,900
essentially summary of what work is

883
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,660
involved in making this happy eyeballs

884
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,740
friend

885
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:06,009
is this something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to do take on</font>

886
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:08,500
okay Simon as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a participant yeah I think</font>

887
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:11,380
it totally makes sense for this to be

888
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">dependent on the actual usage because</font>

889
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:18,190
done can be used at the IP layer to

890
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:21,430
discover IP layer properties or it can

891
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:23,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">be used as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a communication protocol for</font>

892
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:26,799
example when talking to turn server you

893
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,960
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really care about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the family of IP</font>

894
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:36,210
that you're using so it depends on the

895
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:38,560
under usage everybody's happy with that

896
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,510
what the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is like you guys</font>

897
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:43,710
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

898
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:46,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">off and revise the trap I think we have</font>

899
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:49,450
everything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do it before the</font>

900
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:52,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of the week and center</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we we</font>

901
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:55,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">all refers to want to a sister you know</font>

902
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:57,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">i understand i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you you</font>

903
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:59,230
are comfortable with that perfect so

904
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:03,460
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the next one which is</font>

905
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:11,080
turn-based actually yeah we could date

906
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:15,010
applies actually so so yeah given to all

907
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:17,370
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i was looking at so Simon as</font>

908
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:21,310
a participant again I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

909
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:23,710
section 6.2 in<font color="#CCCCCC"> chambers which explains</font>

910
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:27,070
what the server does when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> receives an</font>

911
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:29,890
alligator request and how it detects

912
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:36,220
retransmissions and so it uses

913
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:38,560
transaction ID and the five tuple so one

914
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:41,919
option would be to remove the five

915
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:44,529
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the check if you receive the</font>

916
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:48,520
same transaction ID on a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

917
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:52,090
tuple possibly from somebody else it's

918
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:57,070
the same transaction so keep in mind

919
00:51:52,090 --> 00:52:03,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">there 96 bits of randomness</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost</font>

920
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:04,820
authentication yeah so yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

921
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,180
authentication is

922
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:11,480
part of the retransmission detection

923
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:13,819
yeah I sort of think I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because</font>

924
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">we also have problems because clients</font>

925
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:20,150
needs to but if they go down enough they

926
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,680
can't reuse their original local part

927
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:29,000
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this problem because to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

928
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:31,940
the same binding in math and then just

929
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:36,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">makes allocate requests which generate a</font>

930
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:37,640
401 or item butters<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a view all your</font>

931
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:47,750
first allocate<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests should always</font>

932
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:50,690
generated for a while yeah Kimmy

933
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,800
elaborate basically you send an allocate

934
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,840
request with no authentication

935
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:58,940
information to both the forest except

936
00:52:53,840 --> 00:53:01,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">versus you'll get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 401 response from</font>

937
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,870
one or the other or both at which<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

938
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:08,750
you send the one with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> dedication</font>

939
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:10,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">fish awesome unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody figured a</font>

940
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:13,070
print server to not movies with

941
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,200
medication in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Todd restless expect with</font>

942
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:18,620
sometimes people do it's mandatory

943
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:21,230
internal um actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> no we're changing</font>

944
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:24,560
that for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's because we're</font>

945
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:27,590
jaitley it was mad at her in turn but I

946
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're changing it for the biggest</font>

947
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:30,980
topologically equivalent outs on proxy

948
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,870
basically if you can enforce<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

949
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,000
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to educate offers eight and</font>

950
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:37,310
through you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> network topology or</font>

951
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have ok so</font>

952
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:43,100
then suppose that an enterprise network

953
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:45,680
sets up any<font color="#CCCCCC"> caste ranges for both ipv6</font>

954
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,089
and ipv4 and they turn off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

955
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,169
communication because they manage the

956
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:54,140
network and you get to allocations it's

957
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:57,490
not a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem either you just kill</font>

958
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:59,680
one yeah and that was my second proposal

959
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:03,560
document that you need two kills one

960
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:05,779
yeah and if you don't keep it alive if

961
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:10,460
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just forget about it it'll die by</font>

962
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:14,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">itself you actually there is a supposed</font>

963
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:17,360
to kill that's a serious yes yes refresh

964
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,550
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero right yes what we refresh with</font>

965
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,400
zero references there

966
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:22,750
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know so i</font>

967
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,480
think between those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

968
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:27,760
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course reflecting over over tcp</font>

969
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,740
you can do the standard tcp happy items

970
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">just whatever one ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

971
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:35,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">connectors who extremely happy term</font>

972
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:39,640
goals we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three different answers</font>

973
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:45,370
for how you how you furball so a sort of

974
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:50,020
in order part works yep okay Jonathan

975
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:56,130
can you volunteer to send texts to the

976
00:54:50,020 --> 00:55:07,509
list summarizing this we<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned here</font>

977
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:12,060
thank you yes so note taker do you get

978
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:18,400
that but so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> volunteered</font>

979
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:23,820
okay okay um yeah more things about term

980
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,820
base um mark do you have anything else

981
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:31,960
so I still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have on my list to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do a</font>

982
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:34,060
review for us and to do all of you for a

983
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,250
term of the point of view worst undies

984
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:39,340
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> suffered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with Eterna wanna and this</font>

985
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:42,370
is big spec and I I stopped avoiding to

986
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:45,760
develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> ER</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times to be starts oh yeah I</font>

987
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:49,630
finish what I will get back to take from

988
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:52,390
yeah i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> restart my my review and i</font>

989
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:54,790
will send or use the next so to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font>

990
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:56,740
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will review turn this from the point</font>

991
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:58,509
of view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new standards of the</font>

992
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">story because that's exactly what we are</font>

993
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:04,840
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about so you will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sending</font>

994
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:06,730
basically am a complete or view but<font color="#E5E5E5"> x</font>

995
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,530
only from the point of view escondido

996
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:11,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">excellent because that's exactly what we</font>

997
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:14,350
need okay perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's great but while</font>

998
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,820
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all in the room is there anything</font>

999
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:22,330
you can think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would merit</font>

1000
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:24,910
discussion well so I found one thing

1001
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:27,549
which I didn't like is a new term base

1002
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:30,310
and the problem is that's why turn on a

1003
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,970
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months somewhere oh man I didn't</font>

1004
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:34,070
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with me so and I don't</font>

1005
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:37,990
remember because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

1006
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:43,790
I didn't find anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important</font>

1007
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:47,930
studies part so but it's normal stuff

1008
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:50,660
this is this is aligning the way they

1009
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:52,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">are doing things to the way we are we'll</font>

1010
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:58,819
fix a unique and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you need to use</font>

1011
00:56:52,720 --> 00:57:00,799
charcoal develops not small yeah I mean

1012
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm sorry I should have taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with</font>

1013
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:12,230
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how do you sort of vision and</font>

1014
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,840
ebook to take electronic notes just

1015
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:15,830
kidding thanks a lot for everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1016
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I mean we are looking forward</font>

1017
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:20,750
to receiving it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alan and Peter couldn't</font>

1018
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:21,919
be here unfortunately that's why I mean

1019
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,270
it's a bit difficult to drag the

1020
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,460
discussions but anyway I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

1021
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:30,470
input<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what they need actually</font>

1022
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:31,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so anything anything else well I</font>

1023
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:34,098
mean just to be clear like you were

1024
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,349
mentioning before like you know getting

1025
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:37,970
more drugs through and stuff I mean to

1026
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:40,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">be clear we are trying to close this</font>

1027
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:43,790
working group so in that sense if

1028
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:45,230
somebody wants you know to publish more

1029
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:48,200
drugs or things that we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1030
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:50,119
more work I mean now it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be but now</font>

1031
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,040
I mean drop us an email or on the

1032
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:53,780
mailing list so that we analyze that

1033
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:57,650
because I mean to be honest at the level

1034
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:59,660
of energy is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best so so we want</font>

1035
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:01,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid just you know adding staff and</font>

1036
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:04,368
generating drugs that they take you know

1037
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:06,260
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> to complete so so that's where we</font>

1038
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:08,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">are if you don't agree please I mean</font>

1039
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,710
talk to us so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can understand if</font>

1040
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:12,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's something that that realistic</font>

1041
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:16,730
Lee makes sense to to do German oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1042
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">something then another word a number of</font>

1043
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:21,500
suggestions are the working group of

1044
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:23,510
potential extensions and that time is

1045
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,150
now let's get the visions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

1046
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:28,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">sex up first but I think there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was sort</font>

1047
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:30,500
of some thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you might go back</font>

1048
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:32,210
to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things afterwards there's</font>

1049
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:35,390
usually I feel like there's often more

1050
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:37,400
energy for you know a queuing new things

1051
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:39,259
and getting old things working well

1052
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,940
commercially if there's somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1053
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:43,280
yeah it could be not my concern is

1054
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:44,960
exactly i mean energy so so what I would

1055
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,349
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid these like the chairs now</font>

1056
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,720
we go

1057
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:49,819
and try to generate some energy I mean

1058
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,738
this would be actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are</font>

1059
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:53,630
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend cycles and if they are I</font>

1060
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:54,890
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are more than happy and I mean</font>

1061
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:57,259
we would need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to Spencer of</font>

1062
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:59,150
course but yeah we would be more than

1063
00:58:57,259 --> 00:59:00,799
happy food to working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extensions</font>

1064
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:02,660
that we were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about but but not</font>

1065
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">just artificially where there's no real</font>

1066
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:07,368
interest so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we are all in</font>

1067
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:10,789
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> page regarding that yes that's</font>

1068
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:12,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it's google we have we have</font>

1069
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:16,450
working groups for we have our to see

1070
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:20,328
well still it<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems like we have size</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1071
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">my as long as as long as it's made clear</font>

1072
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:24,259
that the work can continue that

1073
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,999
basically improvements to turn can

1074
00:59:24,259 --> 00:59:28,400
happen and that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a place for</font>

1075
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:30,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">them it doesn't it's not important to me</font>

1076
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,369
which working<font color="#CCCCCC"> group they happen in but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1077
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:37,279
have at least felt maybe I'm wrong that

1078
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:39,049
sometimes a working group closes and and

1079
00:59:37,279 --> 00:59:41,089
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say well that's it this</font>

1080
00:59:39,049 --> 00:59:43,009
standard can no longer be modified

1081
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:45,589
unless you go through the whole working

1082
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:47,569
group formation process so to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear I</font>

1083
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:49,759
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care either I mean let's focus on</font>

1084
00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:51,680
doing the right thing if it's you know

1085
00:59:49,759 --> 00:59:53,390
ad sponsor is a different working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

1086
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,999
is to keep this alive<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't matter</font>

1087
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:58,308
so just concentrate on my point on is

1088
00:59:55,999 --> 01:00:00,558
their energy and once there's energy we

1089
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:03,200
will do the magic admin support so that

1090
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,940
it happens so exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> these more about</font>

1091
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,919
whether this something that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1092
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:11,089
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decide you know how and</font>

1093
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:13,849
what and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example if suppose</font>

1094
01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:16,999
that could decides to use stunned as a

1095
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:22,910
substrate will keep the working group

1096
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:25,939
alive yeah it's having real

1097
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:28,640
implementations going to add energy you

1098
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:30,920
think because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we do</font>

1099
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,769
with stunning we would like to document

1100
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:38,420
and send to the working good you haven't

1101
01:00:33,769 --> 01:00:41,238
we have done that in in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun trace</font>

1102
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:43,160
regard where we use ICMP messages and

1103
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:44,660
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kiba and we have working</font>

1104
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,239
implementation and getting feedback from

1105
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:49,788
that that we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1106
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:54,670
you good problem is that getting that

1107
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:57,550
into browsers telescopes

1108
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">really I mean right and that's why we're</font>

1109
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:01,030
in the idea because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind of</font>

1110
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">networking paradise in that sense you</font>

1111
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:05,470
can talk to people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from browsers you can</font>

1112
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:07,690
talk so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us we</font>

1113
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:09,490
can help obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the idea is to</font>

1114
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:12,340
form a community that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know decides</font>

1115
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:17,140
