queue up your slides all right in the

50
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,950
meanwhile I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to say a few</font>

51
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,080
words so you saw the agenda forum for

52
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:25,010
our session today we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically have</font>

53
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,770
three groups of slides the first one is

54
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,229
about communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> in email</font>

55
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:35,180
communications between the servers the

56
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:38,840
second group or 11 shaft is a

57
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:43,009
the communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the MTA at the</font>

58
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:47,479
server the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first half and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the salt half</font>

59
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:51,889
the third group is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the required</font>

60
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:54,080
header it's all related to email and and

61
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,830
actually they especially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows two</font>

62
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,948
topics are in a pretty advanced stage

63
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:03,560
and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working on them for</font>

64
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:08,300
almost two years now then we would

65
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:11,479
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to get all your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> input at the</font>

66
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:16,460
end of each presentation and see how we

67
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:21,380
can make it happen because we do want

68
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:24,469
these standards to remain relevant and

69
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:27,199
so and so all your help and engagement

70
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:31,430
is needed basically we would like after

71
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:35,149
this session after this week to ask for

72
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last call on the STF drafts and we</font>

73
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:39,620
will see what we do with a with other

74
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,650
ones as well hopefully it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be able</font>

75
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:46,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to accomplish this work in the near</font>

76
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:49,640
future so with that and with technical

77
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:53,029
difficulties resolution issues and so

78
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:59,330
we're looking at the screen in it and

79
00:08:53,029 --> 00:09:01,360
embarrassingly small form actually not

80
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,360
really

81
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,870
I don't

82
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:28,829
first finally I i right yes let Daniel

83
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,570
start talking now because we got at

84
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,910
least some version of your slides up um

85
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not perfect but it's enough to go</font>

86
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,689
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> well then you'll take it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away we're</font>

87
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,760
at the first line this tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

88
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,730
want those two flips lines will do thank

89
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much cool so I do quality I</font>

90
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,380
hope is ok I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apologize that</font>

91
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,329
none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are able to be there in</font>

92
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,260
person but hopefully this works alright

93
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:59,670
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give a brief overview of</font>

94
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:01,380
both TLS rpt and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> STS draft serve as</font>

95
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,839
they stand I think for a lot of people

96
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the audience this is probably</font>

97
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,290
familiar and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully you'll kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

98
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">bear with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me but I wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just give</font>

99
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:20,610
sort of some background first so next

100
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:25,140
slide if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would please are you one</font>

101
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,700
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> exam we're about to room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

102
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,990
worried it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was delayed here then we</font>

103
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,910
aren't perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so just again really</font>

104
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,530
quickly for people who sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

105
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,079
don't remember work in the previous

106
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:40,050
sessions<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying to advance to</font>

107
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,060
related drafts one we're calling TLS rpt

108
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,699
which is for transport layer security

109
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,500
reporting and the idea is just to

110
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,140
provide sort of a very simple protocol

111
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,460
for advertising sort of in the DMark

112
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,610
style that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to receive</font>

113
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:57,090
reports that TLS negotiation errors<font color="#CCCCCC"> dane</font>

114
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,160
validation failures and SDS failures for

115
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,210
mail coming to your domain and so we're

116
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of trying to a little bit of</font>

117
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:07,350
transparency into how server to server

118
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:09,150
smtp<font color="#E5E5E5"> user isn't secured the second draft</font>

119
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,880
i think that the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of larger one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

120
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:15,569
MTA SDS which is for strict Transport

121
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,310
Security for server to server smtp and

122
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,740
the idea here is to provide some

123
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,180
guarantees about what kind of server

124
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,380
authentication and what kinds of

125
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,900
encryption you can expect

126
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:30,120
change servers so next slide if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

127
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:31,439
would so sort of a refresher<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

128
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,000
again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think not everybody in the</font>

129
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,420
audience is super familiar with this

130
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff but I think there are basically</font>

131
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,000
multiple opportunities with the way that

132
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,569
server to server has interview works

133
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,460
today for mana mental attacks so the

134
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">obvious one if the recipient</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terrain is</font>

135
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">not using DNS seconds and there's not</font>

136
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,810
validating<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is MX injection have the</font>

137
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,380
sender speak to your host instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

138
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:57,329
actual host another option of course is

139
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,400
to do a downgrade attack at some point

140
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:04,110
along the way bgp injection simply

141
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,400
serving you know pretending to be the

142
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,230
recipient host but serving assert that

143
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,060
matches your host and not that not the

144
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,490
actual recipient works fine because

145
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,250

146
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:18,420
does certificate validation you know

147
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:20,550
requires TLS in any manner and and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

148
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,280
think in the last sort of handful of

149
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:25,109
years we've seen that opportunistic TLS

150
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,110
in the form of start TLS has really

151
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,250
taken off and is really widely deployed

152
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,720
which is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

153
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,300
for sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of preventing passive and the</font>

154
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,570
middle attacks but you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

155
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,150
there are sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a headful of attackers</font>

156
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,310
who are still sort of able to do active

157
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:48,000
in the middle attacks against specific

158
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:50,069
targets so next slide please so quoting

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,350
well this didn't work out well this

160
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:55,280
slide I think but quoting from some

161
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,950
research that some colleagues of ours

162
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:02,250
submitted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the ACM two years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

163
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:04,830

166
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,700
messages and some of the data are

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,350
missing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide unfortunately but</font>

169
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:19,470
familiar with this survey and you know

170
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,000
essentially like this does happen in the

171
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,260
wild i think we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

172
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of something of a real threat that's</font>

173
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:28,410
kind of the main motivator for this work

174
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,290
i also<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out that in the in</font>

176

180
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,900
provider and we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of users you</font>

181

know we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have a</font>

191
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,080
actually serving the policy effectively

192
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,580
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a handful of things</font>

193
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to call out about how this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

194
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:17,610
effectively the policy says whether you

195
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,980
expect to have encryption and what

196
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,480
centers<font color="#CCCCCC"> should do if it's not present if</font>

197
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,270
they should actually continue to deliver

198
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,350
but tell you about it with TLS rpt or if

199
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,770
they should actually not deliver

200
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:32,850
messages it specifies what the expected

201
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">identity is of the MX hosts and there's</font>

202
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of an open question on this point</font>

203
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,340
so I'll come back to this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

204
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,100
slides but effectively the

205
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:44,190
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect and it specifies</font>

206
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,170
an age and the main point here is that

207
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we're assuming that this will be</font>

208
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">deployed in places where DNS second and</font>

209
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:53,700
Dana are not available we're relying on

210
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,469
people discovering the existence of a

00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy for recipient domain and caching</font>

212
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,450
for a long time and the window of

long live caches ca-based sort of web BK

218

<font color="#E5E5E5">I based validation and basically a</font>

219
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,260
policy just says I expect TLS and I

220
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:21,540
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to verify these particular</font>

00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:24,630
identities next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please so TLS rpt</font>

222
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:27,150
in about five seconds it's basically

223
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:29,310
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMark you say I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to receive</font>

224
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,470
reports about failures send them here

225
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:34,410
and reports have some sort of predefined

226
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,850
semantics for failure categories and I

227
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,160
think you're basically fairly verbose

228
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,650
fairly free form and we expect people to

229
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,390
share a relevant information about TLS

230
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:45,430
negotiation failures of all sorts

231
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,930
you know not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cypher</font>

232
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,609
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree on not having a certificate</font>

233
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:54,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">that validates according to dinner or</font>

234
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:58,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">SDS of that kind of thing so next slide</font>

235
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:59,290
um so current status I think there's

236
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,210
been actually a lot of traffic quite

237
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,640
recently maybe no surprise on the UT a

238
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:08,770
mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this but worse on</font>

239
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:10,540
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 of the drafts and I think both</font>

240
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,579
I mean 22 points i want to point out is

241
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're sort of working at Google and</font>

242
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,460
a handful of other providers on pilot

243
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,500
implementations and we'd actually really

244
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,360
like to sort of settle things enough

245
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,640
that we can launch code without worrying

246
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,930
about formats changing too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

247
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,949
the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

248
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:28,300
really trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mean</font>

249
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,710
curtail discussion because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot</font>

250
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion we've had recently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

251
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,530
been really valuable but i do think we

252
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,120
sort of reached the point where the

253
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,040
fundamental strokes are sort of

254
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,960
seemingly mostly baked so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the</font>

255
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,339
architecture is kind of laid down people

256
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,960
seem to sort of mostly agree on how the

257
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,030
system works and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

258
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,670
discussing a handful of detailed

259
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:49,150
questions which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

260
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the moment so I'm sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of hoping that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

261
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,900
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> form we could discuss these things</font>

262
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:58,329
out and sort of get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> good feedback</font>

263
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:58,939
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look forward next slide please so</font>

264
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,140
the fur

265
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:05,839
open question is fairly sort of

266
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,550
aesthetic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say but I think an</font>

267
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,230
important one obviously people<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

268
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,379
feel strongly about this the policy as

269
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,110
shown in that screenshot earlier is JSON

270
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,860
we picked this basically because its

271
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:18,050
standards track and it's widely

272
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,490
implemented and I think everybody

273
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,159
especially sort of security minded

274
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,170
people felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking people to write</font>

275
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,380
their own parsers is you know not

276
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:29,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally desirable on the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand I</font>

277
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,840
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the alternative proposal</font>

278
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,970
we're entertaining right now is

279
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,800
basically key value pairs not a

280
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:37,160
complicated parser widely implemented by

281
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:40,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">MTA's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think potentially some downsides</font>

282
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,080
not tremendous ones potentially some

283
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,030
upsides again not tremendous one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

284
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,330
see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of not a really really</font>

285
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,379
pressing argument but I think we'd like

286
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,570
to sort of basically get feedback and

287
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,420
reach them consensus I think the main

288
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,760
points raised by proponents of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

289
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,350
key value pair approaches that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

290
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,030
MTA is deployed on sort of smaller

291
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,919
footprint servers don't have a

292
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,750
dependency on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON parser library</font>

293
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,380
today why should they have to take one

294
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,300
which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a fair point so I</font>

295
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,480
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can weigh in on this maybe</font>

296
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:18,530
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go through one more slide the</font>

297
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:19,880
next one please<font color="#E5E5E5"> open question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number two</font>

298
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,020
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one's a little more</font>

299
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,620
nitty-gritty<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I think we've mostly</font>

300
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:27,129
resolved it which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> victa do company</font>

301
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,840
had I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good suggestion that</font>

302
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,490
the semantics of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of MX</font>

303
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,080
constraint that we have in the policy as

304
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,940
we originally designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it was a</font>

305
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,610
constraint<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the hostname and the</font>

306
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,370
hostname should match you know this list

307
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,250
of valid MX's and should present<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

308
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:46,760
certificate which matches its own name

309
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:48,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think Victor suggestion sort of in</font>

310
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,650
summary instead is that the constraint

311
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,690
be a constraint<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the identity in the</font>

312
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,250
certificate presented by the MX so the

313
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:59,360
MX has to have a certificate which has a

314
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:01,550
common name or SI n which matches you

315
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,050
know one of the host names in this list

316
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,780
one of the name patterns in this list

317
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:09,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think the main point of this</font>

318
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,149
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it doesn't modify the</font>

319
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,120
MX list reversal behavior so you'll

320
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,850
connect to every

321
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,489
as advertised you'll simply drop them if

322
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:20,730
they don't my valid cert and it actually

323
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,800
also plays nicely with Dane which I

324
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,600
think leaves the window open<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people</font>

325
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,010
having certificates where the

326
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,800
certificate name doesn't actually match

327
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:32,040
the host name it matches like the domain

328
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,270
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailbox is at and so we sort of</font>

329
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,370
want to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy people to deploy</font>

330
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,810
this without having to deploy new

331
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,040
certificates so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's a pretty</font>

332
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">compelling argument for making this</font>

333
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,800
change and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually already made</font>

334
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,290
this change in the current sort of

335
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,520
github version of our draft but again

336
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'd like to sort of get feedback from</font>

337
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,490
people on this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the big</font>

338
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,290
counter-argument to this approach

339
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually is that we're suggesting people</font>

340
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,629
implement sort of custom certificate

341
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:56,730
matching logic and in particular the MX

342
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,160
list could have a wild<font color="#CCCCCC"> card like as</font>

343
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,080
shown here anything that example.com and

344
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,790
the certificate could have a wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> card</font>

345
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,439
and so there's kind of this possibility

346
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,000
of wild ride the wild card matching

347
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,820
which might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of mild and</font>

348
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,670
complicated so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think these are the</font>

349
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:14,850
main open questions I have a few more

350
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,080
slides on sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of status quo where we</font>

351
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,300
are in implementation but I actually

352
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,040
thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be better to just open</font>

353
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Florida sort of feedback on these</font>

354
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,379
doodles thank you and it's it's your

355
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,570
choice whether you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font>

356
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,220
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides and then go open the mic</font>

357
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,189
and have the knesset discussion about

358
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,250
this too big open questions you would

359
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,590
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss them now well I'm in a</font>

360
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,490
bad position to be the audience so I can

361
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,810
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of see some of these at the</font>

362
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:44,370
microphone so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to take</font>

363
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,780
questions now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the remaining</font>

364
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,820
slides of people are curious is sort of

365
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,680
where we on the implementation stage I'm

366
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,360
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about it but I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

367
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,500
gave the slides actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and we</font>

368
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,340
have sort of minor updates and that

369
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're farther along than the</font>

370
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,520
pigmentation so maybe so the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font>

371
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:03,090
so you think these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two main</font>

372
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,830
questions issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> they stand between it's</font>

373
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,290
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad drops to the last call</font>

374
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,909
I'm optimistically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope so i think</font>

375
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've had some other feedback on sort of</font>

376
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,750
style and clarity and things like this

377
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:18,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">but i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think nothing really sort of major</font>

378
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:23,070
in terms of function<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we have</font>

379
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,510
victim on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the call and we have ya in</font>

380
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,600
person as well

381
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:31,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">go and um Alex my offer I admit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

382
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,689
read the draft yet I have one question

383
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:37,690
arm is there any text in a draft about

384
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,940
the TTL<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the STS definition so when</font>

385
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,900
does it expire is the based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

386
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,520
the DNS record or yeah so actually we

387
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,560
and and I probably went through the

388
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,240
slidable too quickly but if you later

389
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,490
get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to go back to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

390
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,740
by showed the example policy so we have

391
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,350
obviously a DNS TTL as you said but the

392
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,180
policy has embedded in it its own max

393
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,649
age which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how long a passion for and</font>

394
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,870
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of a compromise</font>

395
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,760
obviously because like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think if i</font>

396
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,919
remember right HST s doesn't have an

397
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,120
expiration but we were sort of worried

398
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,680
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possibility that you sort of</font>

399
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,709
keep yourself in the foot and can't

400
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,060
receive mail you know ever so now you

401
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,330
can update a policy as long as you have

402
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:22,110
a certificate for your domain but seems

403
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:22,110
safe to have a max age<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool thanks</font>

404
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,770
oh um let's see that so let's see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

405
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:36,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">can if this works if I hit the button</font>

406
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:39,550
item may be killed Daniel speaking

407
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:43,740
rights we'll see what happens oh yeah no

408
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:50,200
there you go Victor<font color="#E5E5E5"> ha I can hear me</font>

409
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:52,930
hello hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yes we can</font>

410
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,200
hear you better go<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright thanks so um</font>

about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason issue the main thing I</font>

412
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,290
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks</font>

413
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,770
who are addressing it really are focused

414
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:05,139
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> mta's as opposed to some other</font>

415
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:08,560
hypothetical environment in which they

416
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,150
might like to see Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh because you</font>

417
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,730
know if it's just sexy because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

Jason but you're not planning to write a

420
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:20,830
Python MTA then you know really you know

421
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:22,240
enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason elsewhere so I hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

422
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,949
people come at this with a very

423
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,290
practical viewpoint in that they're

424
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:30,490
maintaining or planning to write an MTA

425

some questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's okay hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

431
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:57,110
is Jim Fenton so I have a question about

432
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:00,950
TLS important what about and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

433
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:06,320
sts they in the reporting graph we have

434
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:10,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">a an existing example of a policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

435
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,610
calls for reporting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> D mark and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

436
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,960
wondering if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had and I apologize i</font>

437
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,389
still haven't gone through and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

438
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,010
detailed review but how this compares

439
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,530
with the DMark because one of the things

440
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:26,300
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i noticed isn't there that day mark</font>

441
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:29,870
has is the ability for a recipient of a

442
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:32,330
report to advertise their willingness to

443
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:36,020
accept reports from certain domains so

444
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:41,480
it basically allows the recipient of a

445
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:43,070
report to not get spammed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

446
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,660
reports from people that just kind of

447
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:49,700
say well gee I'll just send my reports

448
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:51,590
off to off to Dan and or whatever so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

449
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,270
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was wondering if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

450
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:58,100
considered something like that or rum if

451
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:00,800
if you you thought that that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

452
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:06,260
necessary um right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you could suck at</font>

453
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:08,330
me right so um we did discuss this I had

454
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,950
to be honest that it's been a long

455
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,300
enough ago that I can't remember my sort

456
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of detailed argument for why it wasn't</font>

457
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,710
necessary but i think we concluded

458
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,678
isolated so indie mark you know

459
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,960
obviously the case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

460
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:24,170
sends me mail pretending to be from you

461
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it protected me from them and their</font>

462
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,160
domain points reports to you and I sort

463
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:30,080
of said a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> spam to you and you</font>

464
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,880
know the same dynamic does exist here

465
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,909
because the reports would be from

466
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,950
somebody's already sending email so they

467
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,690
could I think just spamming directly and

468
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,300
so I had sort of I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of</font>

469
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,950
hand wavy I had sort of a more solid

470
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,200
argument for specifically why we thought

471
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">this wasn't necessary when we discussed</font>

472
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,560
it I'm happy

473
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to dig it out of my email and share with</font>

474
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,340
you but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we felt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that because the</font>

475
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,899
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person sending the reports is</font>

476
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,360
actually a person already sending the

477
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,860
mail to begin with there wasn't an

478
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,600
opportunity to trick somebody else that

479
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:03,639
is sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> a report for you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unless they</font>

480
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:05,439
send you mail right so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell</font>

481
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,050
from my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't fully thought</font>

482
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,490
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issue myself but I just sort of</font>

483
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted to raise well I think that yes I</font>

484
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that leads me to the point</font>

485
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,210
actually said instead it more clearly

486
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,760
now that I have it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in like sort of</font>

487
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> head the point is basically if I</font>

488
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,390
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to send reports to</font>

489
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,680
somebody else to spam them you would

490
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,230
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send me a bunch of mail anyway</font>

491
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,390
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unlikely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you would as</font>

492
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,740
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> person send me the malicious</font>

493
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,530
person a lot of mail and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would sort of</font>

494
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,940
have TLS failures and then you would

495
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:34,660
sort of send them somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> else right</font>

496
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,220
so it's sort of didn't and on the on the

497
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,860
flip side for sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of somebody else</font>

498
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,780
being able to receive my mail my reports

499
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,490
I'm sorry 4d market makes sense because

500
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,629
people receiving<font color="#CCCCCC"> demark reports may not</font>

501
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,160
themselves have a male receive

502
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,480
infrastructure but here are the only

503
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,670
people interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in receiving reports</font>

504
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,840
of those who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> receiving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> l anyway so</font>

505
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:57,040
hopefully that makes sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay my other</font>

506
00:26:52,840 --> 00:27:00,780
question um I have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

507
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:04,659
question about sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 4 sts about the</font>

508
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:07,990
deployment dynamics of of the enforce

509
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,660
mode um I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have this feeling that</font>

510
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they're obviously there will be</font>

511
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:16,110
particular particular domains that are

512
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:19,300
interested in enforcing but by and large

513
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:22,840
no larger email providers and so forth

514
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:25,030
will not be interested you know they

515
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,340
they wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to turn it on because</font>

516
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,990
all of a sudden some of their users

517
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,490
wouldn't be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to receive mail from</font>

518
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,070
certain of their other users and they

519
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:36,010
get a whole lot of complaint reports so

520
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,110
i guess my question is sort of from the

521
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:44,100
standpoint of say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google would Google</font>

522
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mail be likely to deploy a sts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in force</font>

523
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:52,510
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very good question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

524
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:54,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I could say for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I</font>

525
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,500
would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what are the</font>

526
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,070
lessons we've learned from for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example p</font>

527
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,600
equals reject with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Demark is that</font>

528
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,760
users already confused about these

529
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,469
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> demarcus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think actually</font>

530
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,060
much more confusing because the the

531
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,400
example case that I've seen is you know

532
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,690
you have a gmail account set up where

533
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,120
you're from<font color="#CCCCCC"> headers set to your old</font>

534
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,070
yahoo account and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yahoo switches on</font>

535
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,179
people's reject and who do you complain

536
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,439
to that your mail isn't getting

537
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,510
delivered you don't complain the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iou</font>

538
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,210
complied the gmail so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

539
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:24,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">demark created a world where users</font>

540
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:27,790
expectations were you know for sound

541
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:31,060
reasons sort of heavily violated and in

542
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,950
comparison in gmail you know we already

543
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a UI that tells you if we think the</font>

544
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:38,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the message will be sent encrypted I</font>

545
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,970
think it's less of a change and I mean

546
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,260
to caveat that's heavily I'm not the

547
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,880
product manager look I can't speak for

548
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">them but I think it's significant less</font>

549
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,230
of a change to say we're going to warn

550
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:48,730
users that this message can't be

551
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,190
guaranteed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deliver this encryption</font>

552
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,710
and you know perhaps to tell people male

553
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,750
shouldn't be sent at all if the other

554
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,600
domain says that they want enforcement

555
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,770
and vice versa so kind of a hand wave

556
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,870
your response because I can't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

557
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:06,040
sure but I mean I I think that we did I

558
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:08,110
don't speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> open I just if you obviously</font>

559
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:14,530
I you know you probably thought about

560
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:17,860
that this is dkg<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just relaying from</font>

561
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:22,060

563
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,260
still uncomfortable with having to rely

564
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:30,490
on shipping trust related info with

i would like to ask a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

573
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,660
questions Daniel are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you comfortable</font>

574
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,960
doing a couple of humps on these two

575
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:01,690
core questions getting some feedback

576
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,000
from the room so one of the things that

577
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:08,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear is about if we can</font>

578
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,610
step<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the previous slide starting</font>

579
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">with your open question number one of</font>

580
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,709
our policy formats so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

581
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,209
sure we have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room or I</font>

582
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,830
implementing this or planning to

583
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,830
implement that otherwise it just makes

584
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,689
more sense to do this on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

585
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:25,379
hands up if you're sort of representing

586
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:32,130
an organization who who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are likely to</font>

587
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:34,559
implement on this there are some and and

588
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,360
I'm assuming<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people on</font>

589
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,408
jabber or sort of virtually raising

590
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:46,620
their hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> too yeah excellent so the</font>

591
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:49,440
view people would you prefer Jason or a

592
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:52,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">key-value policy format you can just</font>

593
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,580
express your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> invocation or your</font>

594
00:30:52,140 --> 00:31:02,130
preference by well raise your hand for

595
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:03,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jason and then race you it's okay to</font>

596
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:07,460
raise your hand for both actually yeah

597
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:11,429
and raise your hand for four key value

598
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:15,299
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have two on jabber for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason and</font>

599
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:17,970
three on jabber for Jason and two on job

600
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:20,279
refer key value yeah it actually is

601
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:21,539
pretty pretty split down the middle here

602
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,789
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font>

603
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:28,110
go and keep sort of banging on this

604
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:30,149
issue on the mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm you know</font>

605
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,250
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we all like to get a</font>

606
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:33,689
resolution on this but you know we

607
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:37,500
clearly don't have concerts as either

608
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:41,279
way is anybody come it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really critical</font>

609
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,890
can I ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like hey I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah that's</font>

610
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,010
a fair question yeah that's a fair

611
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:49,169
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh-hoo-hoo um hands up who</font>

612
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:58,429
would wouldn't care either way who would

613
00:31:49,169 --> 00:32:01,110
be fine with either choice and on jabber

614
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:02,730
several more votes for JSON on jabber

615
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,428
have come in I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear whether they</font>

616
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,529
were just whether they're on lag there's

617
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:10,380
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> errand zahner also says JSON parsing</font>

618
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:13,320
is a potential security concern there's

619
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">one vote that says just JSON and one</font>

620
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,850
that says I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like to avoid</font>

621
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,830
JSON so there's two should go for whom

622
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,539
it sounds very serious and a several

623
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:25,070
more about saying preference for JSON

624
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:27,559
but not like absolute all right

625
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:30,379
in there and just to you they know in

626
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,720
the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the majority vast majority</font>

627
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,450
of people who voted before also<font color="#E5E5E5"> were all</font>

628
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,730
of them voted for they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font>

629
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:40,730
which one they wouldn't remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

630
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:44,299
I anything where there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> slam towards</font>

631
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:48,049
JSON here but it's not I by no means

632
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:52,940
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> marika</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic you back one slide I</font>

633
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:56,809
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like to avoid JSON so this</font>

634
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:59,960
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one male one forward that one</font>

635
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:02,600
so if key value is widely implemented by

636
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">MTA's why does it potentially involve</font>

637
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,620
handwritten parsers those parcels are

638
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,509
already written we don't have to do a

639
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:14,178
new work right yeah i think is raised by

640
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:16,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the implement and james are using it you</font>

641
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,600
have there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't understand it</font>

642
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,250
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're trying to talk</font>

643
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,080
yourselves at a key equals value for it

644
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:24,340
for a reason i'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> he comes been</font>

645
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,629
doing this for instance what 0706 I

646
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,908
don't know we have we have some code

647
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,889
Whitney but it's sort of six of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one half</font>

648
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:33,559
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't really for us yeah I</font>

649
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:35,090
can't say I care I think obviously I'm

650
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,178
in a poor position away and because

651
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:40,129
Google you know it's not code that other

652
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:41,629
people are using exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we have</font>

653
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:43,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">our own MTA and so it's sort of hard to</font>

654
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:46,418
speak to like Victor's concerns with

655
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:46,419
postfix and lenox deployments

656
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:56,260
um my comment about key value pairs is

657
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:58,178
that yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> mta's implement a number of</font>

658
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,710
versions as the number of places in MTA

659
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:03,309
where you're going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at key value</font>

660
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:05,230
pairs and they're all different so in

661
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:07,120
practice what you end up doing is

662
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,820
writing a slightly different parser for

663
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,638
every case that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to look at key</font>

664
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:15,399
value pairs the one advantage of JSON

665
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,609
that I see which is significant is that

666
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:20,679
at least if this becomes a trend and the

667
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:23,859
future extensions use<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON you only need</font>

668
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:28,060
1 parser the downside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of JSON though is</font>

669
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:30,129
that it now sort of admits a number of

670
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,529
kind of silly cases that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wouldn't</font>

671
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:34,299
see before for instance a string value

672
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,639
you're expecting a string value but now

673
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,990
it's a list or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

674
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,659
you have to take that into account when

675
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:43,689
you're implementing not a bad thing but

676
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:45,280
it is a different way of thinking so I

677
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,590
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a strong opinion either way</font>

678
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,300
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't see I mean at least</font>

679
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:53,020
potentially in the future there's a bit

680
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:55,149
of it for using JSON all right we

681
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,649
clearly don't have consensus but you

682
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:59,350
know and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this on the list</font>

683
00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:03,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're pressed for time quickly very</font>

684
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:06,160
quickly I suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people who want</font>

685
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:08,080
to key value pairs that they write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

686
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,299
proposal to the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list how it</font>

687
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,850
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like so I mean I know it's</font>

688
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,859
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge difference but so that we</font>

689
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,390
don't talk an abstract something that is

690
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:18,460
specified<font color="#E5E5E5"> because something is not</font>

passive-aggressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> mad bit of management</font>

696
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:39,190
let's go and hit next and see go revisit

697
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:42,790
the obesity<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the post versus</font>

698
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:45,160
identity yeah alright so the same kind

699
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:48,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">of feel from from the room and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for again</font>

700
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:52,480
from implementers you know option one

701
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:56,020
option versus option to show hosts vs.

702
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,300
identity you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you raise your hand in</font>

703
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:01,740
preference for for the first version

704
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,740
here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the host version</font>

705
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:15,880
and yeah I did read reporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> drugs I</font>

706
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:20,260
didn't read the other one<font color="#E5E5E5"> today so why</font>

707
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:22,510
not both I've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for Daniel</font>

708
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,730
it's just in a sense of why not allow

709
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,800
the policy to have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> option for both or</font>

710
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:31,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the sense of why it doesn't why it's</font>

711
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a hand so is it is it specifying in</font>

712
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,050
the Polish<font color="#E5E5E5"> cos at the reporting bit</font>

713
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:37,750
sorry I'm have this problem i compute

714
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:40,240
away i magnin<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in the policy so the</font>

715
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,530
question is you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy</font>

716
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,330
should it always be that the MX

717
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,910
constraints the host or always be the

718
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:48,569
dmx constrains only the certificate okay

719
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:53,259
I'm with you now now now we can pull

720
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:57,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so again the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the question is if</font>

721
00:36:53,260 --> 00:37:00,940
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer the the first option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> match</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

722
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:08,160
host raise your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand or say something on</font>

723
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:15,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other yeah I'm asking implementers</font>

724
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:17,680
and nobody and then thus nobody nobody

725
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,310
in the room seems to prefer the first

726
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,879
option that means that if if you prefer

727
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:31,180
the the second option from<font color="#E5E5E5"> patent</font>

728
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:35,590
constraints for s am and CM and does

729
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:38,020
that same thing reflected in<font color="#CCCCCC"> jabber two</font>

730
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:40,210
ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and you ever all right hands for</font>

731
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:42,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject of them yeah okay that means</font>

732
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,280
there is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's pretty</font>

733
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,440
clear consensus over for some big<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

734
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,280
time option then well you know confirm

735
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:55,120
all the list but that's I think that's a

736
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:59,560
that's consensus right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

737
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:02,710
um do so did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have more slides Daniel</font>

738
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,960
um I have a clear sign where we're kinda

739
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,280
do but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually think the most</font>

740
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,410
important part was resulting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's two</font>

741
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,210
questions right because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were sort of</font>

742
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:15,629
little bit pressed for time so we might

743
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:20,820
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I skip those and go to</font>

744
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:23,340
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means you're up Keith why</font>

745
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:35,130
we figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> this switch lines Thank</font>

746
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:39,770
You<font color="#E5E5E5"> Daniel thank you very much so please</font>

747
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,770
bear two minutes with me probably guys

748
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,790
[Music]

749
00:38:53,210 --> 00:39:02,130
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here we go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this</font>

750
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:04,310
is the sixth version of what was

751
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:08,720
originally called the deep draft that

752
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">waiting slide that deals with</font>

753
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,250
interactions between the mail user agent

754
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:17,790
and any of the servers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it talked to</font>

755
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least any of those that use TCP so</font>

756
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:22,980
this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a popper and imap server</font>

757
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:25,500
and a submission server or an<font color="#CCCCCC"> smtp</font>

758
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,500
server used for submission it could also

759
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,750
apply to other things of other protocols

760
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:35,310
that would eq safer directory look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

761
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:40,230
our things like that um so go back we're

762
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:43,710
not gonna mix um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's the</font>

763
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:46,020
scope of the document and um there's

764
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:49,350
basically two mechanisms that implements

765
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,950
the first is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user can specify a</font>

766
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:56,069
minimum confidential confidentiality

767
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:57,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">assurance level and the user is not</font>

768
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,840
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that term but the idea is</font>

769
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:02,820
that you want confidentiality assurance

770
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,440
or not at least as far as the current

771
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,110
draft is concerned there's only two

772
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,310
settings that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined and the</font>

773
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,440
default should be when you're

774
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:12,690
configuring an email account that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

775
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,990
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then if you say you don't</font>

776
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:18,000
and your mail user<font color="#E5E5E5"> agent will say okay</font>

777
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:20,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you insist I will not enforce these</font>

778
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,950
minimum standards on your connection but

779
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,839
mua should encourage users to request

780
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,460
the confidentiality

781
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,980
separately from this there's a separate

782
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:36,130
a second set of criteria which is that

783
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,680
user agents are if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server's indicate</font>

784
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:42,310
that in the future they're going to

785
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:46,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">support certain security features that</font>

786
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:48,700
if the mail user agent is capable of

787
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,170
implementing those in requiring it that

788
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:53,169
the mail user agent upgrades

789
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:55,750
expectations' so the server can say I

790
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,609
will always<font color="#CCCCCC"> support TLS 1.1 and from</font>

791
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:59,950
then on the middle user agencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

792
00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:02,160
TLS is always available<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore i'm</font>

793
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:04,480
not going to downgrade because if I is

794
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,740
something's trying to get me to accept a

795
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,869
lower value of the confidentiality

796
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:10,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a man-in-the-middle attack so</font>

797
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:12,940
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to downgrade anymore both</font>

798
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,010
of those criteria have to be met so you

799
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:19,030
have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> both the users minimum</font>

800
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:20,890
expectation and the security attributes

801
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:25,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have seen from the server</font>

802
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:29,850
before separately<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this this</font>

803
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:32,529
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> has made a decision to prefer</font>

804
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:34,990
TLS on a known port which we're calling

805
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:38,080
implicit TLS instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> using start TLS</font>

806
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:40,270
oh this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just based on experience with</font>

807
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:44,410
starchy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ellis over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the years and this is</font>

808
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:46,150
ok we tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it seems</font>

809
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:49,839
like moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> to none ports is actually</font>

810
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:53,260
the better solution and then also has

811
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,550
provisions for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol fixes some</font>

812
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:58,300
minor protocol fixes for some of these

813
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:59,619
protocols and in band reporting of these

814
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:05,440
security directives and whether they

815
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:09,130
were met<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok next slide the major changes</font>

816
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,980
in version 6 are we change the names of

817
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:15,430
the conf of the confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue as</font>

818
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:17,619
levels so the previous version<font color="#E5E5E5"> had no</font>

819
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:20,379
confidence or no confidentiality at high

820
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:21,609
confidentiality and that seems limiting

821
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,280
because what happens when you need a

822
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:29,259
value higher than high which I think we

823
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:31,660
will need so I i change this a 0 in one

824
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,890
so that that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

825
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what was the name of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

826
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:36,970
highest value or how high can you go or

827
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,529
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that what we've</font>

828
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,419
seen over and over again is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

829
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,080
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep raising the bar as the</font>

830
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,560
attacks give

831
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:47,200
sophisticated so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that he</font>

832
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,560
kicks with certificates that are trusted

833
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,439
to validate any name on earth is going

834
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,330
to be viable<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term so they were</font>

835
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,870
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need other ways of validating</font>

836
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:03,970
certificates validating keys the second

837
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:06,339
change in major change in 06 is um but

838
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:08,529
you know five the TLS sir could have a

839
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:11,860
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> of P kicks or could have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a value</font>

840
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:14,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">of Dane there was really no way to say</font>

841
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,960
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to specify that the server is going</font>

842
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to commit to supporting both in the</font>

843
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,510
future so of the various ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

844
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:24,220
remedy that this seemed like the one

845
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,200
that was Lisa treu civ which is to

846
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,319
define a new keyword which is P kicks

847
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus dating we can discuss if he will</font>

848
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,960
want to discuss what the alternatives

849
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,270
were why I thought they were worse we

850
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:38,890
can do that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this seemed like the</font>

851
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:42,759
simplest change and also um this<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

852
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:45,129
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> both in the security assertion that</font>

853
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,110
the server is making so it can say i'm

854
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,120
using the kick send day<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm supporting</font>

855
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:50,770
both of these in the future the client

856
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">can also use this for reporting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i used</font>

857
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:56,110
both to validate or use one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one of</font>

858
00:43:52,630 --> 00:44:03,340
the other to validate just cert so seems

859
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:07,330
seems flexible enough next<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot of</font>

860
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:09,640
a clarifications no.6 um the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> term</font>

861
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:11,380
confidentiality assurance level was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

862
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,960
of ambiguous<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I added yet another word</font>

863
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,880
to it to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when the when the user</font>

864
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,830
sets this expectation is called the

865
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:22,240
minimum a confidentiality assurance

866
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:24,790
level when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a given</font>

867
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,589
session that can have a confidentiality

868
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,060
assurance level which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher than the</font>

869
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:32,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">minimum so that's why there's a</font>

870
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:35,110
distinction there um make it clear that

871
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:36,910
those two criteria the minimum

872
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:38,200
confidentiality assurance level and the

873
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,089
security directives must both be

874
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,960
satisfied in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue with the</font>

875
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:48,120
connection make it clear that clients

876
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:51,130
may use protocols that if you have

877
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,660
several protocols associated with a mail

878
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,190
account and some of them meet this

879
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,899
minimum confidentiality assurance level

880
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,880
and sub

881
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,700
the client can still use the ones that

882
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,579
do so for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client could read</font>

883
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,200
mail if that connection met that

884
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:05,460
confidentiality assurance level but it

885
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,140
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send mail at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

886
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,910
moment because that's that connection

887
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,200
subject to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an attack it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

888
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:15,240
minor point but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to make it</font>

889
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:18,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear um TLS version 1.1 or greater is</font>

890
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:21,348
required to meet the minimum

891
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,319
confidentiality assurance level of one

892
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:27,270
and either p kicks ordained suffices to

893
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:29,430
meet that confidentiality assurance

894
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:32,460
level the previous draft is kind of

895
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:34,319
ambiguous about that and then also

896
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,940
there's some clarifications about

897
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,579
interaction with antivirus and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just</font>

898
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:41,309
and mechanisms most of these I think are

899
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:47,880
minor but trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be completely Thanks</font>

900
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:50,309
like um there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

901
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,220
something I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at is how TLS</font>

902
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:55,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">served a value of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> P kicks plus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane</font>

903
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:58,020
might affect other protocols using this

904
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,640
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at that yet uh is there</font>

905
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,440
a need for confidentiality assurance

906
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:07,038
levels greater than<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in this document</font>

907
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:09,240
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking not but this future work i</font>

908
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,250
believe it was previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

909
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,439
separate out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iata portions I</font>

910
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:17,369
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't get that memo before i</font>

911
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,470
was editing this document but and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

912
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:21,720
actually think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bad idea it will</font>

913
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:25,589
slow down progress but we could we could

914
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:27,629
go back there if we need to um and then

915
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:30,450
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to add some language about</font>

916
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:32,339
exactly what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> means if you get a</font>

917
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:35,279
connection that doesn't meet these

918
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:36,960
criteria then let's specify it a little

919
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:39,569
more detail what a client needs to do I

920
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,039
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's controversial but I</font>

921
00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:45,750
think it needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done next one I</font>

922
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,869
think that's it yeah okay that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

923
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,869
have

924
00:46:53,910 --> 00:47:03,339
hi Jenn Penton again I see there being

925
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:06,210
two different specifications here one

926
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:08,980
specification is the confidentiality

927
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:10,840
insurance levels it really doesn't

928
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,970
define a protocol it really defines a

929
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:15,730
set of practices and I guess I would see

930
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:19,830
that as being some sort of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp sort of</font>

931
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:23,110
thing that you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of defines how</font>

932
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:25,540
anyways ought to ought to behave and not

933
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:27,550
not to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> configured and how to how they</font>

934
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,520
ought to represent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to users I think</font>

935
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:32,050
that's kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp sort of thing the</font>

936
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,240
other piece of it which is sort of the

937
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:39,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">STS like things I see as being an</font>

938
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:42,970
entirely separate sort of capability and

939
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:45,910
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I honestly have a lot of</font>

940
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:48,939
trouble seeing the utility of what seems

941
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:52,509
like a great deal of complexity there

942
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:57,060
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nu amt ache or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the MUA is</font>

943
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:59,980
always talking with the server through a

944
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">direct connection and you know either</font>

945
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:06,160
side there's a protocol negotiation that

946
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,780
goes on and perhaps if you have the

947
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,960
confidentiality assurance levels

948
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:13,840
implemented then that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sufficient</font>

949
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:18,070
in order to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

950
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:19,840
connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the MUA and the MTA</font>

951
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:24,070
or submission agent or whatever is

952
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:25,660
sufficiently secured<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

953
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:29,560
all I disagree on your first point it is

954
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:31,690
a protocol because this<font color="#CCCCCC"> it documents</font>

955
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that implement this specification are</font>

956
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,980
required as a matter of protocol to

957
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:38,530
abandon a connection that does not meet

958
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:40,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the user specifications that is protocol</font>

959
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:44,860
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate for standards track</font>

960
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:46,810
um the second point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

961
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I also i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

962
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,770
you separated these into two

963
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,210
specifications then it's complicated

964
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,430
because both of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective user</font>

965
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,930
interface and both of them affect the

966
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,669
negotiation of the connection and things

967
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,810
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think it's cleaner if</font>

968
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:01,750
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are both part of the same</font>

969
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:05,049
specification the latter point though I

970
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:05,770
think overall broader picture we are

971
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:08,860
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

972
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:12,759
increase the level of privacy that email

973
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:14,470
users experience now we have because of

974
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,030
the complexity of email and that some of

975
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:17,109
it you know it's hot to hop in this kind

976
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:20,050
of thing like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need a different</font>

977
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:21,700
solution in the MTA relay case then we

978
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,740
need for the interactions between mail

979
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:26,439
user agents and the servers they talk to

980
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,819
those are different cases one has an

981
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,040
explicit relationship that's already

982
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:32,620
defined the other that's not so on and

983
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,420
so forth so that's we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out at</font>

984
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,920
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started out with micros document</font>

985
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,290
putting everything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same document</font>

986
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,440
that really was a mess<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the relay</font>

987
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:44,230
case was so different but we factored it

988
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,730
I mean I narrowed the scope of the

989
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:48,040
document i was working on and then

990
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:51,070
merged with<font color="#E5E5E5"> chris to her this this</font>

991
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:53,350
document because the interactions

992
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:54,430
between the MUA and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers clearly</font>

993
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:56,170
was something that needed to be worked

994
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:58,600
on but this is part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a bigger picture</font>

995
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:00,400
which is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need for all these</font>

996
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,410
things to be encrypted and this is a

997
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,930
legacy protocol or our legacy protocols

998
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:07,000
that didn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know existed long</font>

999
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:10,029
before TLS existed and we're trying to

1000
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,040
rectify that so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know kind of</font>

1001
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:16,030
a paddle patchwork effort to raise the

1002
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:19,060

you verify a cert of a server that in

any way talks to using gain then we

1036
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,599
either have to find a simple way to

1037

actually mean there's the my email

1060
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,290
they will choose the my email works

1061
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,640
option without carrying what's happening

1062
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:08,849
underneath for ninety-nine point

1063
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,140
something percent of users in which case

1064
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:12,059
why while they're having a switch at all

1065
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:14,609
if it's going to work almost all the

1066
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:15,960
time why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave it turned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and not</font>

1067
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:19,200
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the option of switching it off</font>

1068
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,240
it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a switch that either</font>

1069
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:26,069
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do anything or does the wrong</font>

1070
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:27,540
thing I think this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question of with</font>

1071
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:29,490
if you only have opportunistic

1072
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,440
encryption then you can't tell a user

1073
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:32,140
whether or not his connections being

1074
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,210
attacked

1075
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:36,310
there's no way to know that other than

1076
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:38,050
verifying that at least this tificate

1077
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:39,840
matches the name in which case you back

1078
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:43,060
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same problem for web browsers oh</font>

1079
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,610
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if any of you is that I do</font>

1080
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,770
opportunistic I think all mua's are

1081
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:51,010
checking certificates that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen or</font>

1082
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:51,850
used sorry end up meaning i'm not

1083
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:54,220
talking about certificate verification

1084
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm actually talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like for</font>

1085
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,930
instance whether to use start TLS or not

1086
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:00,760
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether to failover from the TLS port</font>

1087
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:02,620
every day so what we do it fast mail for

1088
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,170
this is exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said which is</font>

1089
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:06,940
requiring that you use the implicit TLS

1090
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:09,040
port and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even listen on the</font>

1091
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:11,500
start TLS port in which case that

1092
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,290
problem is solved but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's also an mua</font>

1093
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:17,290
that has is using this standard will

1094
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:18,700
also be an<font color="#CCCCCC"> mua that requires TLS by</font>

1095
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,650
default and doesn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else</font>

1096
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,970
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you must use TLS before I send</font>

1097
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:24,130
the password over the wire and the

1098
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:25,240
problems already solved well except<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1099
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,910
I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is still a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1100
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:30,129
servers out there that don't require TLS

1101
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:31,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that maybe don't even support it so</font>

1102
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:35,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user agents as a practical matter</font>

1103
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:37,660
have to support the legacy servers in

1104
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:39,730
which case this does nothing now in

1105
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:42,940
which case it tells the user what his

1106
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:45,190
expectations can be like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sending</font>

1107
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:48,550
mail to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> service Miami way should</font>

1108
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:50,800
always negotiate TLS and if it ever

1109
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:51,880
fails to do that something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong yes</font>

1110
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,520
but this doesn't need any additional

1111
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:57,610
standard the MUA can just have a button

1112
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:01,450
that says yes or no or require TLS

1113
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:06,340
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make a connection I think the</font>

1114
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:08,439
real problem is that what you'd like is

1115
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:10,750
let's say that I you know because I've

1116
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,400
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a-anyway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been</font>

1117
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:15,640
configured for years to talk to say mail

1118
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,680
accounts and the mail service provider

1119
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,770
has upgraded and now supports kill us

1120
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:23,680
consistently and I shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go</font>

1121
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:25,840
back as a user I have to know and users

1122
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the wild have to know that they have</font>

1123
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:31,390
to go change their configurations in

1124
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:32,770
order to raise a little expectation new

1125
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:34,629
accounts as a different question how

1126
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:36,850
does having a different standard rather

1127
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:39,010
than the MUA is just putting code in

1128
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:41,140
that says if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've seen a successful TLS</font>

1129
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:43,090
connection or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it try a cheerless</font>

1130

connection each time and if I say one

1131
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:47,850
then require and then on there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dip</font>

1132
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:50,130
between a service provider you know

turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> on TLS for some connections and</font>

there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an explicit</font>

1135
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:56,850

1136
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:58,020
had this discussion early wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

well just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because someone enable TLS</font>

1139
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:03,779
does not mean they're going to commit to

00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,890
supporting it that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1142
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:09,120
out there so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so forth and so</font>

1143
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:13,350
that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> made that part explicit</font>

1144
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:15,600
protocol so the user says I require the

1145
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:17,069
provider to supply TLS which means

1146
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,009
they're very configuring the MUA for

1147
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:21,300
their legacy account anyway actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

1148
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:23,580
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is handled by the other</font>

1149
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,680
mechanism which is that the service

1150
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">writer asserts with these security</font>

1151
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,000
directives that they're committing to

1152
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,710
these features in the future and the

1153
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,300
user agent automatically changes this

1154
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:35,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">configuration because that the service</font>

1155
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">provider has made that assertion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

1156
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,300
a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing which from the minimum</font>

1157
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:40,500
confidentiality insurance level which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1158
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,440
when the user configures the account

1159
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:47,340
that basically the expectation is it's

1160
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:50,760
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to require TLS and a valid</font>

1161
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">certificate and all that and only if</font>

1162
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,020
these are insist will it set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

1163
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:58,410
lower value so the default would be

1164
00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:00,630
always for party LS and then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1165
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:03,000
oh if you it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok will because that</font>

1166
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">seems entirely a youth agent</font>

1167
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,720
configuration came to me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

1168
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a separate standard that's tonight</font>

1169
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,230
well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pardon the purpose of the</font>

1170
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:13,290
standard is to specify minimum

1171
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:15,300
requirements for implementations so and

1172
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:17,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">again it is a matter of protocol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1173
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,260
if something claims to meet this

1174
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:21,629
specification and then doesn't close the

1175
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:24,120
connection when those standards aren't

1176
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:25,470
met it's failing to meet the protocol so

1177
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,790
that's why is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work force and this</font>

1178
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,980
track is actually something that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1179
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:37,320
tested in implementations and so on and

1180
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">so forth there's already so Neil Jenkins</font>

1181
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:44,010
um there's already there serve mechanism

1182
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:46,710
for looking up what the browser supports

1183
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:48,510
we already have the so what the

1184
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:52,770
configuration is for particular mail

1185
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:54,450
service there's already a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> purport</font>

1186
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:58,860
defined as we've seen we're going to use

1187
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:59,490
for complicity LS so again if anyways

1188
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,260
want support<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1189
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:02,819
they can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look that up we can say</font>

1190
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,560
just met you know if you're a service

1191
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:06,840
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should implement this they look it</font>

1192
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:09,090
up if they see now that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one with</font>

1193
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:12,030
TLS there they use TLS and don't offer

1194
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:14,070
to not use TLS this doesn't seem to be

1195
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,140
giving a great win whilst giving a huge

1196
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:18,600
amount of X complexity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't</font>

1197
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:19,650
see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> being hugely implemented a huge</font>

1198
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,170
amount of what I didn't hear the last

1199
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:25,140
part extra complexity without the

1200
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:26,730
additional game<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think that if</font>

1201
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:29,790
this actually ends up being a huge

1202
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:31,290
amount of extra complexity that you know

1203
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,730
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should look at it the more it wasn't</font>

1204
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">intended to be that at least when we</font>

1205
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:37,710
started drafting this document that mail

1206
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:40,200
user agents that for instance already

1207
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:43,290
expect TLS and don't ever do anything

1208
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:45,149
else are I think trivially compiling

1209
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:51,570
complying I have to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look</font>

1210
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:53,369
again to make sure and but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the</font>

1211
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:55,200
overall goal and well also<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font>

1212
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:56,940
address your point about the service

1213
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,890
discovery mechanisms my understanding is

1214
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:02,130
that they they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that widely used</font>

1215
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:05,759
and also that they are subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack</font>

1216
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:07,080
unless you use the intersect assigned by

1217
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,320
the units that can use the intersect to

1218
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:13,910
verify them and all that so the

1219
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:17,130
mechanisms we have here are using TLS to

1220
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:21,779
ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those things are not</font>

1221
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:25,290
attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think what we're</font>

1222
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:28,460
trying to do here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this overall</font>

1223
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:31,800
upgrade email to always using TLS

1224
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:33,420
incrementally right without breaking

1225
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,990
existing things that people are doing

1226
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:38,910
but get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the point where email at</font>

1227
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:42,029
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> every hop of email is encrypted</font>

1228
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:43,799
and that's really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall goal or</font>

1229
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:46,470
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a minimum set</font>

1230
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:49,190
of things needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to that goal I</font>

1231
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:51,299
guess the<font color="#CCCCCC"> main thing is a lot of</font>

1232
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:54,270
providers and a lot of the major

1233
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:56,100
providers only offer a TLS connections

1234
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:59,130
like I think gmail does past not as we

1235
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:01,230
haven't offered a non TLS version pages

1236
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:03,030
and just don't open<font color="#CCCCCC"> the port and that</font>

1237
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,310
seems the services that want to ensure

1238
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:07,260
the privacy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> security that seems some</font>

1239
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:09,029
its influence<font color="#E5E5E5"> something they can just do</font>

1240
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,369
now so it's what's the advantage over

1241
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I guess is my house I think</font>

1242
01:00:11,369 --> 01:00:15,749
if if the providers that are only

1243
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,129
offering TLS and not offer unique vertex

1244
01:00:15,749 --> 01:00:19,890
connections and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not having to</font>

1245
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:22,619
support legacy mail user agents or

1246
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:25,650
legacy connection configurations and

1247
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,059
that kind of thing if this is onerous

1248
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:30,240
for those people I'd like to know about

1249
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:34,440
it from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gondwana again legacy mail user</font>

1250
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:37,680
agents are not going upgrade to this I'm

1251
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,779
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the I sorry I said legacy</font>

1252
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,240
mail user agents but we're really what I

1253
01:00:39,779 --> 01:00:43,470
mean is the connections the

1254
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:47,368
configurations of these mail user agents

1255
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:48,660
that haven't changed in years yet

1256
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:49,920
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running an</font>

1257
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,529
email user agent that doesn't support

01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">TLS I can't help you right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know do</font>

1259
01:00:52,529 --> 01:00:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you but you're right I'm not trying to</font>

1260
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:56,700
just yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> how thick the middle east</font>

1261
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,990
between the things that will never

1262
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:01,379
upgraded the things that are already

1263
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:03,749
there that it are worth trying to build

1264
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:06,119
yet another<font color="#CCCCCC"> standard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring that that</font>

1265
01:01:03,749 --> 01:01:07,529
middle along<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think what</font>

1266
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:09,990
happens is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people upgrade their</font>

1267
01:01:07,529 --> 01:01:12,900
mail user agents as they get updates but

1268
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:16,258
don't upgrade their configurations and

1269
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:18,839
the ideas that make the configuration

1270
01:01:16,259 --> 01:01:20,910
sort of automatically upgraded as the

1271
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:26,038
service of either<font color="#CCCCCC"> has increase their</font>

1272
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:27,839
support for things so this is fairly

1273
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:30,390
easily sold weather service providers by

1274
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:32,670
just it stops working<font color="#E5E5E5"> you fix it its</font>

1275
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:35,700
aggressive reliable it's a one well

1276
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:37,349
what's the alternative this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1277
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:40,049
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a better better model to support than</font>

1278
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:41,400
that yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I've done I don't follow</font>

01:01:40,049 --> 01:01:43,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the upgrade path that that actually</font>

1280

works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that it can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be man in the</font>

1281
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,940
Middle's to destroy the connection

1282
01:01:45,089 --> 01:01:49,499
forever for that user if they're

1283
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,180
connecting clear text without in the

1284
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:52,980
encryption then a man-in-the-middle

1285
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:54,868
could take them down a separate path

1286
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,460
well it only works if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user agent</font>

1287
01:01:54,869 --> 01:01:57,930
gets upgraded that's true right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1288
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,549
you're never upgrading your user agent

1289
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:01,440
it will never comply with the spec it

1290
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:05,130
will never implement or any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> spect</font>

1291
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,319
that we might write so yes it's some

1292
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:08,670
point down the road when you only have

1293
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:10,859
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attend two percent of your</font>

1294
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:13,619
subscribers still connecting and clear

1295
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:15,230
text then turning them off and dealing

1296
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:17,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that tenth of a percent makes sense</font>

1297
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:19,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it makes sense you know</font>

1298
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:22,079
when half of your subscribers are doing

1299
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:24,210
that so I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say we've done</font>

1300
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,050
several upgrades like this to force

1301
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:27,240
users to

1302
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,650
security model connections which

1303
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,140
involves changing their settings over

1304
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:33,180
time yeah didn't quite a new standard at

1305
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:35,339
all and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> as compatible all anyways</font>

1306
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:36,990
because we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the log in log</font>

1307
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,280
so we know who is connecting to us and

1308
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:41,850
we know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> security they're connecting</font>

1309
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:45,510
to us over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we would start with</font>

1310
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:47,220
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1% move up to two percent and of the</font>

1311
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:48,990
ones using the Institute connections

1312
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:51,600
email them say you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade and</font>

1313
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:53,100
after time cut them off at the server so

1314
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,230
it sure they would still connect on that

1315
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:57,060
port but we would reject the<font color="#E5E5E5"> log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

1316
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:59,790
forcing them to upgrade that way you can

1317
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:01,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">do partial users over time until you've</font>

1318
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,730
moved everyone and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut the</font>

1319
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:05,070
whole port off and the whole thing's

1320
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:07,320
gone that lets you do this incremental

1321
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:09,420
upgrade to a higher security lets you

1322
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:11,490
control how fast and who the customer

1323
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,690
support side of that and doesn't require

1324
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,520
any new standards we've done this

1325
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,870
several times we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> bourse do because</font>

1326
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:23,430
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always new security stuff who's</font>

1327
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:24,750
we I'm sorry I'm fastmail<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um all</font>

1328
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">right i mean i'll go and take a look at</font>

1329
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:28,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i wanna i want to see if we really</font>

1330
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">can affect all this because there maybe</font>

1331
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:32,250
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should write a draft about that if we</font>

1332
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">can we can solve this problem without</font>

1333
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,910
adding protocol maybe that's the right

1334
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:45,600
thing to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could publish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1335
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:50,460
document about that how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you please use</font>

1336
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:52,110
the mic for a baby so yeah the great

1337
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,180
thing about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you know it's a</font>

1338
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:55,950
process not a new standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that you</font>

1339
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:57,930
can do it without requiring any new

1340
01:03:55,950 --> 01:04:00,120
spool from the mua's every mua that

1341
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:01,799
supports TOS you can do this with

1342
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:05,069
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you managing this on</font>

1343
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,240
the server and yes it does mean the

1344
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:08,070
users themselves have to update the

1345
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,379
settings but you control how many how

1346
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:12,060
fast and cut them off incrementally and

1347
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:14,370
that incremental<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuffs really important</font>

1348
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,290
I don't know if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was anything this</font>

1349
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:18,240
spec about that and it looked like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1350
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:21,150
was everyone well would be hard to make

1351
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">it incremental there's always support</font>

1352
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:25,650
issues with any kind of change like this

1353
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:27,450
and so at once<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're at a sufficient</font>

1354
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:30,540
size you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be else do it in stages</font>

1355
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:32,009
so yeah I think that as a process seems

1356
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:34,740
to get most of what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is trying to</font>

1357
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:36,090
achieve without acquiring new standards

1358
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,560
yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go over the</font>

1359
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:38,340
document cuz i mean this document is

1360
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,750
trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> achieve</font>

1361
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:42,870
number of different things and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1362
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:45,240
go over and say what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that we can't</font>

1363
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:48,779
get by what you're proposing the other

1364
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:50,729
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say is like how again</font>

1365
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:53,730
stepping back the broader problem is how

1366
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:55,140
do we get all email encrypted email and

1367
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,610
this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indian that's a separate</font>

1368
01:04:55,140 --> 01:05:01,170
problem which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also still needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1369
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:03,480
solved but and what's the best path to

1370
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:07,080
do it and how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> this organization des</font>

1371
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,910
promote that so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find a better</font>

1372
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,920
approach in this document I'm all for it

1373
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:13,890
or maybe it may be a subset of this

1374
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">document is still needed but yeah okay</font>

1375
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:19,680
that is a great great<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation</font>

1376
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:22,350
really helpful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I would like</font>

1377
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:25,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask just out of curiosity sees the</font>

1378
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">staff has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time in works</font>

1379
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:34,080
and how many vendors here actually have

1380
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:40,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">been playing in training implementing</font>

1381
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:46,290
this draft in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

1382
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:51,000
laughs okay great thank you so I while

1383
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:53,040
we queue up Jim so again this is the

1384
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea for this is all about running code</font>

1385
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:57,060
right so we're at some point we're going

1386
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,950
to get to the same sort of discussion we

1387
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:01,020
had for the loss draft and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know look</font>

1388
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:03,029
at implementers and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that what</font>

1389
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:05,960
we're specking out actually has support

1390
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,960
among implementers

1391
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:26,300
find Sonia we're looking at we get

1392
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:30,640
working on slides again for the remote

1393
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,640
people yep we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the slides</font>

1394
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:39,590
mmm ready to go all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it away</font>

1395
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:42,589
Jim okay let's so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to talk about</font>

1396
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:46,700
a graph<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're calling require TLS</font>

1397
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:49,310
on the next slide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just to review</font>

1398
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:51,890
I presented it initially at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boy no</font>

1399
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:55,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cerys last year and then remotely once</font>

1400
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:58,069
since but the the the issue here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

1401
01:06:55,730 --> 01:07:00,560
when you're sending an email message you

1402
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:02,840
typically have no idea how it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1403
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:05,150
be handled in transit whether whether

1404
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,340
the transit is going to be TLS protected

1405
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:09,860
or not sometimes when you're sending a

1406
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:13,910
message like if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with my</font>

1407
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:16,760
financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisor or maybe if I'm often</font>

1408
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:18,680
often some other country where I don't

1409
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:21,410
know what their what their policies are

1410
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,720
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it's not entirely clear whether</font>

1411
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:28,790
that message is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in the clear</font>

1412
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:33,200
on the on the internet or not um so

1413
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:38,390
start TLS is uh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think everybody knows</font>

1414
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:40,879
it's opportunistic and but not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1415
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:43,910
the question whether to negotiate TLS

1416
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:46,880
opportunistic but also certificate

1417
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:51,470
verification is typically ignored that

1418
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:54,800
if if the the certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the smtp</font>

1419
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:57,140
server doesn't doesn't verify we just

1420
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,850
kind of log that and keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1421
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:00,950
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want but it's not always</font>

1422
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:05,410
what you want some centers want to

1423
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:09,649
prioritize security over delivery and

1425
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:18,020
the goal here is to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sender to</font>

1426
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:22,910
specify whether or not to to require

transport encryption between mtas in the

1428
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:30,858
in the message app this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a different</font>

1429
01:08:28,009 --> 01:08:32,450
approach complementary to the STS sorts

1430
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:36,050
of things where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recept</font>

1432
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:41,300
very fine-grained it's it's done in a

1433
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:43,430
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> by message basis so you know you</font>

large scale breakage of you if you

<font color="#CCCCCC">and this is this is just between between</font>

recipient got a mess the the last hop

1445
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:23,930
MTA got a message that was that was

1446
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:27,080
tagged<font color="#E5E5E5"> require TLS maybe they might</font>

1447
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:28,850
require that the message be retrieved

1448
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,319
securely or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really given that</font>

1449
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:34,940
much thought it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like something</font>

1450
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:37,069
that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next so the approach</font>

1451
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:39,859
here is you there's an additional

1452
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:44,830
service extension called require TLS

1453
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:49,990
that's in addition to start TLS um the

1454
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:52,370
there are particular rug options<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1455
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:55,010
certificate verification and also

1456
01:09:52,370 --> 01:10:01,760
whether or not the MX look up has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1457
01:09:55,010 --> 01:10:03,920
done securely using a DNS SEC um and in

1458
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:08,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i will read everything on the</font>

1459
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:10,480
slides here but that's what's there

1460
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:15,920
there's also and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommended by</font>

1461
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:18,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">victor an option to not require TLS</font>

1462
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,540
because there are times when you know

1463
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:22,700
especially in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presence of some of</font>

1464
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:24,620
these policy mechanisms there might be a

1465
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:26,240
time when you there's a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

1466
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:30,140
just really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want that message to get</font>

1467
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:32,300
through maybe it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know server</font>

1468
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:34,400
going down or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know something that's</font>

1469
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:37,960
not sensitive but that you need to get

1470
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:40,490
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there is on in this</font>

1471
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:44,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">latest version of the draft i added a</font>

1472
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:46,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">required TLS equals</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no which basically</font>

1473
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:53,240
overrides a policy mechanism

1474
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:55,100
for a particular message um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1475
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,760
requirements follow the message if it

1476
01:10:55,100 --> 01:11:01,760
goes through multi hops each each hop

1477
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:03,620
keeps track of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> party LS status of</font>

1478
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,030
that message and then uses that when

1479
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:07,580
it's sending the message on board and

1480
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:10,040
there's no there's no policy record here

1481
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:16,220
so there isn't a discovery problem it's

1482
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:19,100
like so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put out this new version of</font>

1483
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the draft mid-february with the things</font>

1484
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:24,200
that I described particularly the

1485
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:29,440
required TLS equals know is that is the

1486
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:32,090
biggest change<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are now two</font>

1487
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:35,210
prototype some implementations one for

1488
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:36,950
XM and one for EM demon that have been

1489
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:39,350
done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done some limited</font>

1490
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:41,420
interoperability testing we have some

1491
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:45,520
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do there but we have at least</font>

1492
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:51,740
the ability to exchange require TLS

1493
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:54,230
protected messages with those and then

1494
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:56,929
here's a little more detail on on what's

1495
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:59,660
new the required TLS equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> know which I</font>

1496
01:11:56,930 --> 01:12:01,610
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> described and some additional</font>

1497
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:03,309
guidance on what to do about bounces

1498
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:06,349
bounces are kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem here</font>

1499
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:10,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">because when you bounce a message you</font>

1500
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:15,200
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> require the same TLS going back</font>

1501
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:17,509
toward the going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back toward the return</font>

1502
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:20,570
path going back toward the sender of the

1503
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:23,890
message because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know part of what</font>

1504
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:27,349
we're trying to protect here is the

1505
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:29,630
header information and if the bounce

1506
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:31,660
message contains header information it

1507
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:35,810
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be protected the same way and</font>

1508
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:37,610
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you know we need at least some</font>

1509
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:40,370
some guidance that says if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1510
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:45,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">to send require TLS messages make sure</font>

1511
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:46,940
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive them but there</font>

1512
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:53,180
might be some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> options as well go</font>

1513
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:56,450
on um so a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that came up on</font>

1514
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:59,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the list in terms of the issues one was</font>

1515
01:12:56,450 --> 01:13:01,960
whether require TLS

1516
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:04,040
should be advertised in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hollow on</font>

1517
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,770
initially when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her fire</font>

1518
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:09,800
TLS equals no the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you could do</font>

1519
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:13,520
require TLS was after you had negotiated

1520
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,680
start TLS which meant that maybe we

1521
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:18,920
should only advertise it on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hollow</font>

1522
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:22,970
that occurs after start after TLS had

1523
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:27,320
been negotiated so that was that was one

1524
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:30,290
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questions on the the counter</font>

1525
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:33,349
argument is that if you advertise it on

1526
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:35,540
All Hallows then at least you have some

1527
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:37,550
early indication whether the recipient

1528
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:40,180
is likely to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to accept the</font>

1529
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:43,400
message not so you can abort before

1530
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:49,670
actually negotiating TLS if you have a

1531
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:51,440
require TLS message um and but this may

1532
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:54,440
be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a mood issue because required</font>

1533
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:57,349
TLS equals no doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> require the</font>

1534
01:13:54,440 --> 01:14:02,179
negotiation of TLS so I guess we need to

1535
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:03,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertise it earlier are the there's</font>

1536
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:06,470
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> some question about the the</font>

1537
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:09,440
different options I I<font color="#CCCCCC"> used the names</font>

1538
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:12,310
Damon chain it's really danan p kicks

1539
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:16,969
probably are probably better names um

1540
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:21,920
for much the same reasons as<font color="#CCCCCC"> keith was</font>

1541
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:24,739
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about with his draft the</font>

1542
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:28,430
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> was are there other situations</font>

1543
01:14:24,739 --> 01:14:31,219
where an attacker might have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability</font>

1544
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:32,900
to manufacture valid certificates some

1545
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:36,350
of the attackers that we contemplate our

1546
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:39,019
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> state-level actors and so that's</font>

1547
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:42,440
a possibility although<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's you know</font>

1548
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:45,170
maybe a very narrow corner case<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font>

1549
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:47,269
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been is it are we over</font>

1550
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:49,730
engineering the spec by providing this

1551
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:52,460
level of granularity this level of

1552
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:55,790
detail about how we require certificates

1553
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:58,880
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> verified or should we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font>

say verify equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes oh I believe</font>

a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just want to join the</font>

01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:37,670
there's unusual skepticism about DNS SEC

1565
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:39,650
deployment whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not having</font>

1566
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:41,960
requirement that the MX records look up

1567
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:46,489
with the DNS SEC is something that

1568
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:48,199
people will actually deploy and then as

1569
01:15:46,489 --> 01:15:50,360
I mentioned earlier the question about

1570
01:15:48,199 --> 01:15:51,710
bounce messages or whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some</font>

1571
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:54,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that we can send some sort of</font>

1572
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:56,659
redacted bounce message that doesn't

1573
01:15:54,080 --> 01:16:02,120
reveal sensitive information but kind of

1574
01:15:56,659 --> 01:16:03,769
will allow the originating MTA to be

1575
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:06,849
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out which message was</font>

1576
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:14,420
that didn't make it may be alert they

1577
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:16,969
next and so when I'm when I'm wishing

1578
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:19,580
for from the working group is more

1579
01:16:16,969 --> 01:16:23,300
review we've had kind of very thin thin

1580
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:25,429
comments from a very few people and I'd

1581
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:27,520
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have enough that we could have</font>

1582
01:16:25,429 --> 01:16:30,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we all rough consensus um</font>

1583
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:34,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would like to see this adopted by the</font>

1584
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:36,710
working group you know we've got

1585
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:38,239
interoperable implementations so I think

1586
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:41,120
that represents a certain level of

1587
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:43,580
maturity of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specification actually</font>

1588
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:46,580
we don't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> often adopt things that we</font>

1589
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:48,019
don't have implementations of yet um I'm

1590
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,730
looking for other people like to try

1591
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:52,190
this out you know using using one of the

1592
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:56,000
implementations we've got or create one

1593
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:59,540
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for questions yes Victor</font>

1594
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,989
I guess you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on okay thanks so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

1595
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:07,159
I'm one of the strongest people behind

1596
01:17:02,989 --> 01:17:08,928
the it's over-engineered viewpoint I'd

1597
01:17:07,159 --> 01:17:13,460
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much suggest that anything</font>

1598
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:18,620
more specific than must TLS or must<font color="#E5E5E5"> Els</font>

1599
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:22,699
with authentication is is unlikely to to

1600
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:23,840
be deployable so please no specificity

1601
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:26,089
as to

1602
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,940
whether DNS SEC is used where the Dane

1603
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:31,190
is used where the pickax is used I think

1604
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:36,348
no user is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to know even how to</font>

1605
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:39,049
specify it or what it means so even

1606
01:17:36,349 --> 01:17:41,090
whether or not require TLS means with or

1607
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:42,889
without off may not be something that

1608
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:45,920
users will really be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

1609
01:17:42,889 --> 01:17:48,020
but at least I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are the the</font>

1610
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:51,830
maximal levels that i would suggest are

1611
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:54,739
viable the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to</font>

1612
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:59,630
mention is that as the instigator of

1613
01:17:54,739 --> 01:18:01,159
require<font color="#E5E5E5"> tlf equals no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been having</font>

1614
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:04,130
some thoughts about how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1615
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:06,980
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on the side and I'm</font>

1616
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:09,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering whether that should be</font>

1617
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:13,519
specified via esmtp commands with

1618
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:17,449
require TLS or maybe this particular

1619
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:22,040
facility is better handled as a header

1620
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:23,989
in the message rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a verb in</font>

1621
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:27,349
the protocol and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for that</font>

1622
01:18:23,989 --> 01:18:29,809
might be that require TLS equals no can

1623
01:18:27,349 --> 01:18:33,110
safely travel<font color="#E5E5E5"> from TAS that don't</font>

1624
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:36,409
understand the verb right if I have a

1625
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:39,500
legacy MTA that doesn't do TLS doesn't

1626
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:41,900
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it won't require TLS it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1627
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:44,090
because we can send the message on and

1628
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:46,250
if then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> following hope up somebody's</font>

1629
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:49,130
are very clever and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mike otherwise</font>

1630
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:52,400
bounce the message<font color="#CCCCCC"> christy less policy</font>

1631
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:56,630
by the receiving system is is hostile to

1632
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:59,059
delivery here the if we pass it through

1633
01:18:56,630 --> 01:19:00,949
a header then the header can tunnel to

1634
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:03,949
each and every node that might be able

1635
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:06,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a little bit more permissive in</font>

1636
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:09,530
its policy so unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

1637
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:14,739
that's more wear and tear on the draft

1638
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:19,040
but maybe this is not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right channel</font>

1639
01:19:14,739 --> 01:19:22,669
44 TLS optional maybe it should be

1640
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:26,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">header instead the other thing is should</font>

1641
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:28,580
the is there still an<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMTP working group</font>

1642
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:30,049
anywhere at the ITF maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1643
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:34,760
involve them and not just you two I

1644
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:35,530
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how many folks who are a sort</font>

1645

of

more focused<font color="#CCCCCC"> innocent keep even the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1648
01:19:41,619 --> 01:19:46,808
comment on this because there are

1649
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:51,280
private discussions about forming email

how they go it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have might not</font>

happen if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens it will happen very</font>

1653
01:19:56,110 --> 01:20:03,179
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right um yeah let me just</font>

1654
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:08,259
respond very quickly to Victor um I

1655
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:10,360
guess with respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to putting it in in a</font>

1656
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:12,369
header I understand the motivation to

1657
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:15,190
that that's that's an interesting idea a

1658
01:20:12,369 --> 01:20:17,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit it's from a sort of protocol</font>

01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:19,239
layering<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint it seems seems to be</font>

1660
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:22,150
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit a little bit tricky to</font>

1661
01:20:19,239 --> 01:20:24,159
handle trying to to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information</font>

1662
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:26,379
out of the head or in order to affect it

1663
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:32,679
but we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done things like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the</font>

past the I'm more reluctant to remove

the the DNS SEC option than I am to

1666

P kicks options just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it seems</font>

1668
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:49,510
like there's a huge vulnerability a huge

verification vulnerability that exists

1670
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:58,599
if the MX gets food and that that exists

1671
01:20:53,679 --> 01:21:01,389
even if you have verification<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the of</font>

the certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a quick comment on</font>

1673
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:05,980
that because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane adoption</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-thirds to one percent of</font>

1677

domains have published DNS SEC so we're

1678
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:25,800
a long way from anybody realistically

1679
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,179
being able to require DNS SEC on there

1680
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:33,610
for transmission of any significant

1681

01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:52,160
you know should should be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

1707
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:55,100
know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do it that way but</font>

1708
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:58,880
it's not going to encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of</font>

1709
01:22:55,100 --> 01:23:01,850
widespread adoption<font color="#E5E5E5"> of MTA to MTA TLS</font>

1710
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,960
the ideas you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use case</font>

1711
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:04,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">today I have in mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are things like</font>

1712
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,070
reporters in the field when they're

1713
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:09,290
sending reports back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their newspapers</font>

1714
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:11,210
could you know they would they would

1715
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:12,440
know that or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they'd want to</font>

1716
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:14,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that their reports were</font>

1717
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,889
protected this way right so they could

1718
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:17,419
do that because they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1719
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:19,310
newspaper infrastructure supports it and

1720
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:22,100
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> know hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their mail I their</font>

1721
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:23,810
MSP supports it so they can for that

1722
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,430
particular case they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make that and</font>

1723
01:23:23,810 --> 01:23:28,040
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not likely to have this</font>

1724
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:29,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">balance yes so yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds</font>

1725
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:31,580
like we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same page that's good</font>

1726
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:33,500
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the idea I'm not going to dig</font>

1727
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:35,059
into the details yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

1728
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:37,430
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to point out this is a</font>

1729
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:39,410
different problem so yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I don't</font>

1730
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:41,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect that that's that's the reason</font>

1731
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:42,710
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's message by messages they don't</font>

1732
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:45,730
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's going to be something</font>

1733
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:48,050
that people can turn on for everything

1734
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bronco iguana I was in favor of the</font>

1735
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:52,460
header until I just heard that the

1736
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:54,049
problem with having it as a header

1737
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:56,000
rather than something that's negotiated

1738
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:59,780
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time between the mta's is</font>

1739
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,280
that if you negotiate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first hop with</font>

1740
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:02,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> header and it's sent correctly and</font>

1741
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,639
then it goes to hop that does

1742
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:06,410
understand this after that and quite

1743
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,270
easily go over an on TLS connection and

1744
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:10,099
you'd have no way of knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1745
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:12,320
you have to if every MGA that supports

1746
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:14,720
this has to explicitly check that the

1747
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:16,759
next one supports it as well as having a

1748
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:18,140
chair less connection then you can

1749
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,150
follow the whole chain and know that

1750
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:21,950
it's dead kill us the whole way yeah i

1751
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:23,599
think the case that Victor had in mind

1752
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:27,170
for using the header was the start Tia

1753
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:30,350
the report<font color="#CCCCCC"> els equals know which was the</font>

1754
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:32,570
case where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1755
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:35,300
knit<font color="#E5E5E5"> two to negotiate it on every hop</font>

1756
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:38,120
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna cut the line after whoever's</font>

1757
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:41,090
Victor and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let that flying</font>

1758
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:44,120
dissipated go ahead Victor I just

1759
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:48,260
confirming what keith said yes I'm sorry

1760
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:50,870
Jim sorry the just a note case will is a

1761
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:58,430
candidate for a header the yes case has

1762
01:24:50,870 --> 01:25:01,700
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> about alright so I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1763
01:24:58,430 --> 01:25:04,930
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a some guidance from our ad here it</font>

1764
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:09,440
would this be in scope for our charter

1765
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:15,050
would you rather we win sort of put this

1766
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:16,940
on somebody else um in scope yes i would

1767
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:19,270
rather concentrate at the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

1768
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:22,820
concentrate on existing drafts first

1769
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:25,490
that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> clean drive that's a fair</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

1770
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:27,799
yeah and that doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font>

1771
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:29,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> delay this for you know nine nine</font>

1772
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:32,930
months if we cannot do anything else but

1773
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:35,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do like what we could do we could sort</font>

1774
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:37,460
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> also try to figure out whether there</font>

1775
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:39,860
is interest in the in the working group

1776
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:42,110
for adopting implementing something like

1777
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:44,420
this right yeah and that that way you

1778
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:47,030
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim knows whether he should to keep</font>

1779
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:48,710
sort of spinning on this or whether it's

1780
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:51,950
sort of work this time to do so I and

1781
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:54,860
then we can decide to actually adopt at

1782
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:58,400
a later time that makes sense yes

1783
01:25:54,860 --> 01:26:00,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright and Jim was cc'd on a private</font>

1784
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:02,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation about email maintenance</font>

1785
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:06,050
working group so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think he's trying to</font>

1786
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:08,150
submitted there as well as i find so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

1787
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:10,460
assuming you know given the fact that

1788
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:13,460
we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like make a make a</font>

1789
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:15,170
call to adopt this today<font color="#E5E5E5"> however and</font>

1790
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:16,520
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that we seem to have a</font>

1791
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,530
representation from quite

1792
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:20,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">phew implementers in in the room and</font>

1793
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:24,080
virtually or whatever you know all the

1794
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:28,100
implementers who would be in who would

1795
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:35,120
implement this have hands in the air and

1796
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:37,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">jabber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Plus Ones or something who would</font>

1797
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,630
consider implementing something like

1798
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:40,790
this so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have to be exactly</font>

1799
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:43,010
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like this two</font>

1800

hands raised on jabber orange<font color="#CCCCCC"> honor</font>

1801
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:50,240
Richard you've got three right and maybe

1802
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">faster okay with the emphasis with an</font>

1803
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:57,380
emphasis on on the simple the simpler

1804
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:59,780
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right all right so there</font>

1805
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">there seems to be at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least some support</font>

1806
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:03,710
for something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the</font>

1807
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:08,690
implementation and you already have two

1808
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:12,770
implementations in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

1809
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:15,169
to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> question who you know and</font>

1810
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:20,360
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for the general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group to</font>

01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:22,760
use would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you support adopting a this</font>

1812
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:27,259
something that looks like this as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

1813
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:36,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">your document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1815
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:41,420
right we'll take this as an indication

1816
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it this isn't there there is some</font>

1817
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:46,220
interest here and we'll definitely

1818
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:47,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">revisit this I guess you should take</font>

1819
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:52,810
this as an indication to keep sort of

1820
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:56,810
keep spinning Jim<font color="#CCCCCC"> and with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>
