34
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:43,630
job of coming up with a slide template

35
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:45,790
to discuss all of the drafts so without

36
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,380
further ado most of this meeting is

37
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,590
probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be asking for people</font>

38
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,470
to commit to reading the drafts there in

39
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,660
a couple cases help Shepherd a document

40
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,090
through their short they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

41
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,040
straightforward they're easily separable

42
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,630
there's not a lot of relationships among

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,000
all of them it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you have to</font>

44
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:14,530
send<font color="#CCCCCC"> in understand all of HTTP before</font>

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:16,420
you can understand h2 so okay so um this

46
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:23,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">drop I think this dress is one of our</font>

47
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">priority we have discussions about</font>

48
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:30,450
assigning your IDs so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we took a decision</font>

49
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,340
which is requesting the ini<font color="#CCCCCC"> ark</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

50
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,969
putting this whole idea to under this

51
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:39,340
arc there has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> some discussions</font>

52
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:43,690
about pre hash this is non pre ash

53
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:47,859
signature I think the consensus is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

54
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:52,110
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should use we are only defining the</font>

55
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:55,840
draft for non pre hash version variant

56
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,570
so I guess want to comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think</font>

57
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,179
that that also should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> said for all</font>

58
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,270
the drive if we should say that clearly

59
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:11,080
it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a design choice</font>

60
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:13,810
and yeah there is a awesome identifier

61
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,300
for the pre hash variant so well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

62
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:21,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">are only focused on the non pre hash</font>

63
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:24,880
then probably we should remove this next

64
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:29,040
like I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two slides on</font>

65
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:35,440
this dress<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the next step</font>

66
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:40,000
alrighty values update<font color="#E5E5E5"> diversion and we</font>

67
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,710
need some reviewers so that this week or

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,190
next week we can

69
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:54,880
send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to the iesg so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I never</font>

70
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:57,460
launched here no you care about Sam ok

71
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,350

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,349
to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> without at least one up from</font>

73
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:11,530
first have you read<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I guess what so</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's more the way to graph is</font>

124
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:14,540
written but it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's pretty</font>

125
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:19,060
well shaped and almost ready it's a very

126
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,060
short drat i think less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 pages so</font>

127
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:40,250
people coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> later are going to be a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Saunders I mean review choose one or two</font>

131
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:52,070
drafts review them and then we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

132
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward why don't you get no cookies at</font>

134
00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:10,280
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> come on yeah yeah this drafty well is</font>

135
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:15,200
also pretty much ready some changes have

136
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:19,400
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> submitted to the least he has been</font>

137
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,100
considering various implementations so I

138
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,439
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear but it would</font>

139
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,310
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> better to have some other feedbacks</font>

140
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:32,270
other reviews it's mostly to see if the

141
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:37,099
text is clear rather than a contact I

142
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:39,470
mean so that's pretty easy to go yeah it

143
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,570
is already widely deployed discussion

144
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,570
bullet says<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it points up</font>

145
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:59,919
um yeah this one's so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I get</font>

146
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:04,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">very confused with the name of the draft</font>

147
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:08,499
so this one is adding a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> gfield new</font>

148
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:13,629
key exchange algorithms based on the new

149
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:17,709
other kernels the curves yeah it's only

150
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:19,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">adding a one point or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two so please say</font>

151
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:25,299
you agree with a draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we can</font>

152
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:26,498
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> that forward next slide and if you</font>

153
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:27,970
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions on each of these</font>

154
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:30,939
dress or issues you want to give you

155
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,499
read it right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you want to</font>

156
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:35,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring up step up to the mic and we will</font>

157
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:38,789
back up no problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to set a</font>

158
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:38,789
speed record here we'll look the curb

159
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:45,129
don't just one question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH in</font>

160
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:47,108
general what happens if you put with the

161
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:50,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">existing applications or app that are</font>

162
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:54,399
out there if you have nests<font color="#E5E5E5"> SH key for</font>

163
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:57,309
an algorithm that isn't understood did

164
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,309
the widely used versions of ssh do

165
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:06,789
something sensible or do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

166
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:10,269
and die has anybody looked into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

167
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:12,819
a key or a host key usually as so I

168
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,079
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the widely used in Satan</font>

169
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:15,248
plantations<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a whole bunch</font>

170
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,598
of files in your daughter's age

171
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:22,089
directory to try and find something that

172
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:24,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can they can use no they're just</font>

173
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,049
carry on for the next thing yeah until

174
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,809
it hits the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air account it says too many</font>

175
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:39,309
failures but yes it does a reasonable

176
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:46,290
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well this one is also adding</font>

177
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">two point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> codes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so smart on this one too</font>

178
00:13:46,290 --> 00:14:00,199
no 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's a good les hommes this</font>

179
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:04,529
one named adding named eh groups

180
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:07,380
specific ones I'm curious I'm curious

181
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:11,300
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS folks think about it since we</font>

182
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,300
sort of have kind of dropped those I

183
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:22,889
mean sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is microphone hi and</font>

184
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,060
we're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like moving towards the</font>

185
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">different set of groups in this some</font>

186
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,638
little surprised you're not adding the

187
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,029
ones that we spent the trouble

188
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,769
standardizing but you know not for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

189
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:36,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you what to do rather than you</font>

190
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:38,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">should do what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font>

191
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">more about capturing what's in the</font>

192
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,639
deployed base then moving forward I

193
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:47,550
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valid concern though and</font>

194
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,790
should probably be reflected in security

195
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,859
considerations section this is dkg sorry

196
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually haven't read this at all but</font>

197
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,160
I'm assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are finite field</font>

198
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">routes that here that's fine I actually</font>

199
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,930
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that you should say use the</font>

200
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:03,540
same groups that we specified for 40 of

201
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:07,079
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> although I do think we should have</font>

202
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,819
specific specified groups so i'm not

203
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure why ecker recommended that you use</font>

204
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,790
the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same groups that we did it's</font>

205
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,230
fine to have two different protocols use

206
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,949
different sets of groups as long as

207
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:25,709
they're strong<font color="#CCCCCC"> primes usual usual</font>

208
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:27,389
constraints out of 90 google so if this

209
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:28,589
is just documenting existing reality

210
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,779
than that that's great and should be

211
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:36,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh why wouldn't you just want to</font>

212
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:40,800
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same groups just less text just</font>

213
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,290
to to provide mean the rules for

214
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,139
generating groups that are strong are

215
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,060
not complicated like we understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

216
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,709
and so you might want to not use them

217
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,239
across domains if there's some weird

218
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:53,880
something gets cross domain that we

219
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,490
don't understand there's a bunch of

220
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,470
situation with cross domain attacks

221
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,150
because you're using a similar protocol

222
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,590
and things hook together

223
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,850
it turns out that something<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS looks</font>

224
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,370
like something an association can be

225
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,470
reused I don't see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

226
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:12,360
know and if you avoid using the same

227
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:13,710
groups you can avoid that<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem if</font>

228
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Greta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are the same groups as I</font>

229
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,300
them then now you die you're just the

230
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,819
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I vs SSH so I'm totally fine</font>

231
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,040
with using one set of groups for one

232
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,050
protocol to avoid any<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible cross</font>

233
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,790
protocol condemning a condition that I

234
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:34,229
don't understand I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to have a</font>

235
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:35,969
specific answer oh I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

236
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,590
didn't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hugely convincing but</font>

237
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,210
the my organ was purely like it's less

238
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:41,210
typing and that's not great either sir

239
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,520
all right we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encourage</font>

240
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:58,800
discussion on the list and maybe pollute

241
00:16:50,520 --> 00:17:00,390
I can TLS also I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I those</font>

242
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
groups has any equities here like you

243
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,939
know we may have some overall ITF

244
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,339
question what we should do but it's not

245
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,570
like jealous cares what I mean other

246
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,470
than as a general matter of principle

247
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:12,810
cares what I safe does um anything that

248
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,910
me adam says these are just this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

249
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,708
you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just endorsing stuff</font>

250
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,459
however pure to do that great if we're

251
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,320
on acceptable at least if I if if we're

252
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,850
picking new groups that we nobody use it

253
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,129
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to use weepers I ask why</font>

254
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,569
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> second I would say like there are</font>

255
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,680
these other group structure we that we

256
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:33,389
were happy about there are q9 sunseeker

257
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,670
and these are the groups that are

258
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">usually naik and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP second they have</font>

259
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,360
been there<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all time over and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

260
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">are venerated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in same way that the one</font>

261
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,540
certainty Eleazar created except they

262
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:47,669
are using pi and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Taylor's using me</font>

263
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">yata care but ever they're getting ready</font>

264
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have the same base so actually either</font>

265
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,760
one is fine it's just you know which you

266
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,620
think is both of them are used already

267
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:04,230
all the donors that we know best right

268
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">already so it's just picky one so the</font>

269
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:10,010
second half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phrases and running</font>

270
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,010
code so that would argue for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ike</font>

271
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,740
okay I it might be a little premature

272
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,169
for last call who solicit some

273
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:32,450
discussion on the list it might be a

274
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:35,480
bike shed anybody else anybody else have

275
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:43,990
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other issues drafts potential work</font>

276
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:47,240
they want to discuss well we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have um</font>

277
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:51,080
well when the CMS draft and the peak

278
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,530
eggs draft will be sent will we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

279
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,020
receipt of requests to for a GSS update

280
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:03,649
and so that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

281
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:06,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming draft before we close yeah that's</font>

282
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:10,970
right so that was off mic there before

283
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:14,270
we close Russ so I'm sorry I was late

284
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:18,620
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk about draft p kicks and did</font>

285
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:20,360
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> settle on absent null or both um if</font>

286
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:24,500
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like the darker added since</font>

287
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,149
we're all here so nope rehash all that I

288
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:30,950
understood that was better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

289
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:32,660
yeah no let's explain the issue we did

290
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:37,040
not talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it we did not talk well</font>

291
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:44,180
it's Jim here yeah yeah so the asn.1

292
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:49,940
structure allowed the when you're the

293
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:53,330
parameters<font color="#E5E5E5"> field in 1997 when they</font>

294
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:56,960
converted from the 1988 syntax to the

295
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:59,330
newer<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1 syntax some editor dropped</font>

296
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,730
the word optional in algorithm

297
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:06,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifier and as a result a bunch of</font>

298
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:09,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were forced to specify null as a</font>

299
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,480
parameter when none was needed and then

300
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:16,220
they had it optional back in the next

301
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:19,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">release and so there is some some code</font>

302
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:23,930
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does not</font>

303
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,750
yet know hear that optional is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

304
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:30,090
they insist on

305
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:32,340
some parameter and so I prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not do</font>

306
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:36,090
that but get people update their code

307
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:40,280
and the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> line is that we have one</font>

308
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:43,620
place in that document where there's a

309
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:48,149
discussion on the list about whether

310
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:50,070
it's optional order null and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

311
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,100
point that i have dated<font color="#CCCCCC"> benjamin made</font>

312
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,290
and I agree with him was pick one don't

313
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,300
make it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept either one</font>

314
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,780
because then you end up that's where the

315
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:05,010
interoperability promos come am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i right</font>

316
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:08,129
Jim mirrors did I<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks but I'm</font>

317
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:12,720
that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier if other people can</font>

318
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:15,900
support that view yes underneath that's

319
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,340
why i love<font color="#CCCCCC"> stark warrior I don't 90</font>

320
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,790
google<font color="#CCCCCC"> I strongly support that for you I</font>

321
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,100
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a hoot what which one it is</font>

322
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,690
if this group doesn't pick one then we

323
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,219
will pick one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we will break everyone</font>

324
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,080
else who picks<font color="#E5E5E5"> every anything else and</font>

325
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:33,030
and therefore i will pick it so i

326
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,800
suggest you pick it so on the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font>

327
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,710
you'd be like well the existing deployed

328
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,360
base expect something on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand</font>

329
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,980
the existing deployed base is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

330
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,370
need changes to support these curves

331
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,400
anyway so let's just do the clean right

332
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:53,580
thing Jim the document right now has

333
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:58,140
picked one which is dark yes it matters

334
00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:06,379
because Java<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standard Java provider</font>

335
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:13,140
can't deal with it a pamphlet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

336
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:14,760
right I think they're so document okay I

337
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you're also a lot of other</font>

338
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,200
algorithms that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually using</font>

339
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:21,570
saying that you must not have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

340
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,310
you first let's have now they're so if

341
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,860
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't support that they don't to</font>

342
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:28,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">portos sequence all girls either so I</font>

343
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,800
think the chiverses need to fix it their

344
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,800
stuff fun

345
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:42,219
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how to phrase the question</font>

346
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:48,160
without annoying people but um then yeah

347
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:51,640
well okay so yeah absent break some<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

348
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:56,230
in both so how many want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support</font>

349
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,870
those hum absence or brick city<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

350
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:05,559
right so it's absent simplest cleanest

351
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:07,059
break some<font color="#CCCCCC"> java none no no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i hated this</font>

352
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:09,760
one s when sequel had the problem too

353
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:13,120
right no you carry an explicit I'm not

354
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:17,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and then both so how many people</font>

355
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">are in favor of supporting both how many</font>

356
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:23,980
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in favor having no there's an</font>

357
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:26,830
explicit I'm not here how many people

358
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:31,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">are in favor of having no indicator when</font>

359
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:35,250
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no option that's a pretty clear</font>

360
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,250
consensus will confirm it on the list

361
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah right yes I got to know not and Jim</font>

362
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:56,530
do you have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> any doc changes to</font>

363
00:23:49,780 --> 00:24:07,120
do that I yeah that's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a straight</font>

364
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:11,379
line yeah all right great<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think</font>

365
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes right surprise okay anybody else</font>

366
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:21,480
anybody else have any other business

367
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:25,270
they want to bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> up yes okay all right</font>

368
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:38,200
there is a last question about the use

369
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:46,560
of PSS and/or PKS s 11.5 so for I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

370
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:52,240
it's a RSA it is sh yeah

371
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:54,429
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can find the draft name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crew</font>

372
00:24:52,240 --> 00:25:02,470
the colonel Arthur you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get shot good one</font>

373
00:24:54,430 --> 00:25:07,500
yeah yeah so one question is do we have

374
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:11,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">a we would like storing to move to PSS</font>

375
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:15,130
given that well PK CSS is kind of we

376
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:18,850
can't avoid that one so do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

377
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:22,330
add a PSS or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea to have</font>

378
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:30,550
these two variants personal preference

379
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:34,270
shoot 1.5 in the head just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what</font>

380
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:36,820
like TLS 13 did jump um<font color="#E5E5E5"> try you have</font>

381
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:39,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">mirror hitter Goodman on the list said</font>

382
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,520
that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually no weakness that</font>

383
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:45,580
we know of with PK SI s 1 point 5 so it

384
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,129
might as well stay with that it's true

385
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:52,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's that it's easier to make</font>

386
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:54,520
proofs about PSS but there's no weakness

387
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:58,240
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I add some new stuff when we already</font>

388
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:01,840
have because he s 1 point 5 not my

389
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,870
arguments pretty good yeah there are

390
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,240
given I think they were soon attack but

391
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,620
if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very short you know expert</font>

392
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,880
if you enjoy whispering tree or

393
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,909
something like that there was some type

394
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,270
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1.5 that was more vulnerable to</font>

395
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,740
something than PSS yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font>

396
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:23,830
mean if you are saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

397
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:26,380
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 1.5 there dearies yeah yeah</font>

398
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,570
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I mean yeah then I'd</font>

399
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,630
basically also<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually just moved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

400
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:34,510
basic was using 1.5 old also and now in

401
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,800
the bin which defied the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Liberator to</font>

402
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,960
sleep in search we actually only

403
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,639
departed you know to say that the PSS

404
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,100
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> under the soup to speak on which</font>

405
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">of course causes you know issues because</font>

406
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,860
people actually have to implement it

407
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">when take them into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signature algorithm</font>

408
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:50,260
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a very simple you</font>

409
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,330
know oh we have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> or sequences up</font>

410
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,160
tickle giggle<font color="#CCCCCC"> sickness algorithms and we</font>

411
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,840
just change the format they actually

412
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,190
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement VSS also but I think</font>

413
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,610
it actually would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be better to move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

414
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,610
PSS

Adam Langley<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google PSS would be nice</font>

416
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,530

417
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,580
as a whole and so is it really worth the

418
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:12,470
time to worry about this steaming pile

419
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,990
and sorry make up the context<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong but</font>

420
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,430
we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this for Shi yeah</font>

421
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:22,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have anybody implementing in the</font>

00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:24,530
room<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then we shouldn't decide um you</font>

423
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:27,260
know I've near jenin opposing you then

424
