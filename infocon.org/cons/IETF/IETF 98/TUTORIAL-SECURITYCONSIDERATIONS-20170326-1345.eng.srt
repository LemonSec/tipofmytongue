00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,760
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> most because there's no way for</font>

5
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,050
me to get through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these slides in</font>

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,340
the amount of time we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no matter</font>

7
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:10,920
what but we're going to try anyway I'm

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:19,140
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sew my name is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kristin osseo at</font>

Carnegie Mellon University and so we're

10
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,840
going to do a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> overview of some</font>

11
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,490
considerations for writing so the

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,330
security considerations sections for

13
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,070
rfcs it's not going to be kind of a

14
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:36,030
hundred percent comprehensive there's no

15
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,690
way to do that in in an hour and just as

16
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:44,580
a quick note i'm not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rehash</font>

17
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:48,179
what's in RFC 3552 there's still good

18
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:53,158
advice in there so go read that but it

19
00:01:48,179 --> 00:02:00,050
is a little bit dated at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

20
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:05,459
it's like this oh sorry so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

21
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:07,590
3552 biss and the author and it's

00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to be offended because in</font>

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,760
that's a horrible thing so what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,760
should do after this tutorial is go back

28
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,519
and read the update<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 3552 incentive</font>

current security model security

31
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,640
considerations does everybody know about

32
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,910
the security does everybody know what

33
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,349
the security considerations section is

34
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:45,650
how many how many are first-time

37
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:57,840
RFC more or less have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a security</font>

38
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,629
consideration section and that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,140
cover the and we'll go over this at

40
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:07,170
least somewhat but it has to explain how

41
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,470
you're protecting whatever protocol it

42
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,510
is

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,850
developing against the threats that

44
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,910
you've outlined and what the measures

45
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:18,239
are now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a smaller</font>

46
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,250
enhancement to a larger protocol in

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,050
which case you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have to cover</font>

48
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,970
your pieces but you have to understand

49
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,980
what youre your threat model looks like

50
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,020
and and what it is you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

51
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,420
protect it so we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over</font>

52
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,340
some some guidelines on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font>

53
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,989
writing that security<font color="#E5E5E5"> consideration</font>

54
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,560
section and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people are</font>

55
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,690
old-timers here yeah and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,560
are from the security Directorate itself

57
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:51,180
in the room who are here to heckle yeah

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the basic</font>

59
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,240
document is still pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's very</font>

60
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">old we feel a little relative low number</font>

61
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,050
updates that have happened since<font color="#E5E5E5"> then is</font>

62
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,930
I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest one is Snowden and</font>

63
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,959
knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are national scale</font>

64
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,940
with actors scooping up all of the

65
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,820
information on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so they can</font>

66
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,400
decrypt it later or analyze it later or

67
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:18,298
perhaps in case of wikis and things like

68
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,340
that do it into my real time as joe said

69
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">though it's currently stalled we really</font>

70
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,419
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try to push this over the line</font>

71
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:31,830
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully you'll all go out and read</font>

72
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:36,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get comments so I want to if we</font>

73
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,760
look at the what's in 3552 we have a an

74
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,640
attack model that differentiates between

75
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,969
kind of passive attackers active

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,770
attackers and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things we want</font>

77
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to under you know explain to people is</font>

78
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:53,000
use an attack model understand what the

79
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,270
attack model is against your system

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,430
define what its boundaries are and and

81
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,890
then describe how your protocol is

82
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,720
protected against those things so here's

83
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,550
an attack model there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> others you</font>

84
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,040
could use stride you could use a number

85
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">of other ones this is a the cyber kill</font>

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,190
chain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about why</font>

87
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:17,010
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of relevant to what we see</font>

88
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,950
is some set of current activity again

89
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,110
that that's against attacks happening

90
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,500
kind of now and these are the

91
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,420
phases that we view in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> model that</font>

92
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,860
an attacker is going to go through right

93
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,720
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do reconnaissance on</font>

94
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,160
your network they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

95
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,770
development potentially that's the

96
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,050
secure works modification weaponization

97
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,440
of the of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they're going to</font>

98
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:42,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">inject into your system do delivery</font>

99
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,850
which means that might be an email that

100
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be a physical type of attack of</font>

101
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,640
convincing somebody put a USB key into a

102
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,080
system that's inside your perimeter

103
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,729
whatever it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the delivery at</font>

104
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point we then start to do the</font>

105
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploitation we install the next phase</font>

106
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,960
of it we have commanded control inside

107
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,480
the system and then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

108
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,789
whatever our actual objective was so

109
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,190
this is an attack model but it describes

110
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:11,720
a bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> phases where if the</font>

111
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:14,600
goal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to block you know step 8 then</font>

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:24,010
you have all those other phases at which

113
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:27,170
you can you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> defeat the attack so</font>

114
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,270
that's that's a model<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really good</font>

115
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,310
against an attacker who really wants to

116
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">establish persistence in your network</font>

117
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:37,640
who's going to spend a long time

118
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:41,120
observing your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know kind of</font>

119
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,150
really developing a customized exploit

120
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,460
and do do the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack but it</font>

121
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,549
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be sufficient for all types of</font>

122
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:53,960
attacks there's a much more simple case

123
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,640
that's kind of prevalent so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,630
data from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the verizon data breach report</font>

125
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,159
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to step outside the video</font>

126
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,500
recording for a moment and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of point</font>

127
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,740
it slide but so what we're kind of

128
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,430
seeing here is this tells you this is

129
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,590
seconds minutes hours days weeks months

130
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,740
for an intruder coming into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

131
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:19,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what this says is that and this is</font>

132
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,680
the time to start exfiltrating and so

133
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,540
what we see is in the previous model

134
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just described as the kill chain</font>

135
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,890
model we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an attacker who's going to</font>

136
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,630
spend a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time surveilling your</font>

137
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,810
network building a customized implant

138
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,880
and exploiting your network that's not

139
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,980
necessarily always true

140
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,590
what we see now is a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> smash and</font>

141
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">grab taking place as well so attackers</font>

142
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,750
penetrate the network from the time that

143
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,370
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your users clicks on that</font>

144
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,230
mistaken attachment inside there it's

145
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,060
minutes before they're starting to exfil

146
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,340

there if not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the content</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or not the</font>

168
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:58,250

my company uses we use signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> for inter</font>

170
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,410
messaging right and if they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

171
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,450
out all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arca my people here don't</font>

172

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,170
just know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can track all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in target them free the</font>

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,920
further surveillance or physical harm or

00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,740
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is so when people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say it's</font>

180
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,750
just metadata it's not it reveals a

181
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,000
surprising amount of information about

182
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,130
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> being observed and that's</font>

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,110
something we really have to consider

184
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,900
when you're writing considerations no

185
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:39,020
not just the content<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the messages but</font>

186
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:41,689
message headers if you will and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font>

187
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:45,800
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat covered in the current draft</font>

188
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:47,390
but we really want to have change the

189
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation about what a passive</font>

190
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,439
attacker versus an active

191
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:54,390
attacker is right so you know under the

192
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,880
generalized threat model here right

193
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,810
passive attackers can see everything

194
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,220
exchanged outside of your defined border

195
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:05,670
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> re-emphasize that</font>

196
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,850
it's really important when we do a

197
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">security review to understand what the</font>

198
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,290
boundary is between what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you consider</font>

199
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">inbounds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and out of bounds now the</font>

200
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,709
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> Directorate when doing review</font>

201
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,780
may disagree with your assessment of

202
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:22,080
what your border is because I know that

203
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,610
I've complained about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at least</font>

204
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,320
then we can be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

205
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,220
thing as to where the where the lines

206
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,230
are right so if it's a you know

207
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,680
pervasive<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can build a comprehensive</font>

208
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,690
behavioral model doing passive and then

209
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,239
also if you have a you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

210
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:42,240
passive then things like you know

211
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">offline attacks so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how long</font>

212
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,710
does your crypto key last<font color="#CCCCCC"> before you</font>

213
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,180
cycle it for a passive attacker you

214
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,580
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have infinite compute</font>

215
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,140
resources or some version of that

216
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">offline and they can do an offline</font>

217
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,140
attack right active attackers can inject

218
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,450
packets into the network so that means

219
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that any packet you send between you and</font>

220
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,130
what other endpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're</font>

221
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,200
communicating with they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can inject</font>

222
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,410
another packet with that they can edit

223
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,280
the packet that you've sent all of those

224
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:17,579
kinds of the tax right so you know this

225
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,050
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this differentiation doesn't</font>

226
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,110
necessarily quite cover things like

227
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:25,670
denial service but it's important to

228
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand what those two differences on</font>

229
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,780
so security considerations the impacts

230
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,110
you want to make it clear as much as

231
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,939
possible you know what it is you are

232
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,380
claiming to protect or what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you</font>

233
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,260
are worried about actually and what it

234
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:46,100
is you're not worried about so say for

235
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,450
example now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are not worried about</font>

236
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,280
passive surveillance of every packet on

237
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,100
the network well that probably wouldn't

238
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,790
fly anymore but saying we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried</font>

239
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,970
about correlating messages from a cell

240
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,770
phone to at home versus a cell phone at

241
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">work well it's got the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> caller</font>

242
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,620
number anyway

243
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,420
so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably okay so you want to</font>

244
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,220
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the security reviewer</font>

245
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,579
and/or reviewers because they'll be at

246
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,470
least two they understand your document

247
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,899
what it is you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to draw as your</font>

248
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:19,170
security perimeter what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside that</font>

249
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:21,000
counts and it is being protected and

250
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,790
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> where this perimeter is going to</font>

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,890
sit if it's on the general internet

252
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,660
that's one thing if it's only intended

253
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,860
to run behind the enterprise or

254
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,620
something else protected by

255
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,920
carrier-grade NAT that might be slightly

256
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,110
different develop the attack scenario

257
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,699
early<font color="#E5E5E5"> on at the beginning what are the</font>

258
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,970
things you're trying to prevent what are

259
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,649
the things you think attackers can build

260
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,660
then I'll put a plug in for the

261
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:48,089
certificate transparency has a security

262
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,550
architecture document it goes really

263
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,310
into great detail describing all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

264
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,170
parties in the protocol and what happens

265
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,750
if this one goes rogue or that one goes

266
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,930
rogue and what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> after-effects are now</font>

267
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,850
that grew until whole separate RFC and I

268
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,410
don't think most documents need that but

269
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,630
understanding who the parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> are on the</font>

in the communications and what happens

if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> is corrupted spied on or</font>

272
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,370
otherwise led down the wrong path I

273
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,430
guess also<font color="#CCCCCC"> know also it's good to know</font>

274
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,390
what doesn't apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you can say for</font>

275
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:26,160
example oh we are only using TLS 13 or

276
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,050
message exchange and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

277
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,990
to worry about the whole crypto stuff

278
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you just do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by indirection</font>

279
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so so these are the set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

280
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,280
things that we're actually going to

<font color="#CCCCCC">cover as we kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of go through this</font>

00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,959
update so this may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not hit some concern</font>

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,450
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have if you want you can come</font>

284
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,670
complain to me afterwards you can blame

285
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,800
all this part on me but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of go over communication security</font>

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,000
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to be some amount of</font>

passive but<font color="#E5E5E5"> data collection soft middle</font>

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,069
device and then once they're that far

292
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of game on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS and its role in</font>

293
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,110
security overall and then Internet of

294
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,140
Things and if we have time I'll talk a

295
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:20,000
little bit about fishing only because it

296
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,000
still works and it's fun to talk about

297
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so communication security so passive</font>

298
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,600
attacks collect huge amounts of

299
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,760
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think everybody in the</font>

300
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,770
room should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty familiar with that</font>

301
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,830
and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons why this</font>

302
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:42,030
effective right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pete humans are</font>

303
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:44,040
very much creatures of habit I can bet

304
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,680
the vast majority of you get into the

305
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,020
office<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day pull up your computer</font>

306
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,420
maybe you check your email first thing

307
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,730
maybe you check a couple of websites the

308
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,770
first thing but you probably check the

309
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,930
same websites the first thing when you

310
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,300
come in and you probably do a specific

311
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:03,180
affair<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee common order between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

312
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,219
your email or your web we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to</font>

313
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,630
know what the address<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we don't</font>

314
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,700
need to know necessarily what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

315
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,439
content of what you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

316
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,020
is to know that you came<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the office</font>

317
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,880
we just need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you go look at</font>

318
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,829
these specific sites in order every

319
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,770
morning to know that you're there and

320
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,780
that's the metadata problem because

321
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,430
humans are creatures of habit you leaked

322
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,770
that information just<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the metadata</font>

323
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:28,760
level just by knowing IP addresses in

324
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:32,819
succession we can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get that right</font>

325
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:35,220
so that's you know the metadata level of

326
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,900
what's leaking out of the network that's

327
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,500
going to tell us<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

328
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:43,470
that's part of that metadata right so we

329
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,350
can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> enhance metadata analysis</font>

330
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,480
with just some really minimal packet

331
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,269
inspection and

332
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,860
a little bit more active material so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

333
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:54,990
could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything i described just a</font>

334
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,899
moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago just with IP addresses and</font>

335
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:02,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">port numbers if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i add a little bit of</font>

336
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:04,589
information to say look at what's inside

337
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:09,149
the packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can get a lot more</font>

338
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">information then right just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just banner</font>

339
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:15,180
grabbing of the protocols I'll learn a

340
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:17,430
whole lot more about so these are things

341
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,029
from a passive collection you really and

342
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:22,888
information we could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to</font>

343
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:27,389
you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to kind of go against</font>

344
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:29,339
right this is where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another case</font>

345
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:31,290
where understanding what that security

346
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,360
boundary is and what set of information

347
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">is inside the boundary and outside the</font>

348
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">boundary is really going to help</font>

349
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:40,500
understand what the defense's should be

350
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:46,740
and what needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protect it</font>

351
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:48,779
right it gets even better from a passive

352
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,990
observation point of view that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there</font>

353
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:53,730
are active<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle boxes in there so if</font>

354
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,430
you have an active middle box in the

355
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,730
path and I can control some other point

356
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:02,250
in the network I can make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

357
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,470
active middle box which may be doing

358
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,660
behavioral changes to the to the

359
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,610
communication such as minimizing

360
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,040
graphics and that kind of stuff by

361
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:12,659
understanding what kind of operating

362
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,149
system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> host you have in your hand</font>

363
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,870
along<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way so if it knows that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

364
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:21,480
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android device on a limited</font>

365
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:23,938
connection link and the middle box is

366
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to change what it asks for along</font>

367
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,990
the way I can use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

368
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:31,830
a passive point of view to understand

369
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,390
what target operating system and screen

370
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,970
size and all of that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff from</font>

371
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">your device along the way so the middle</font>

372
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,179
boxes are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to potentially leak</font>

373
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:48,500
information about your connection as

374
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:53,750
well yeah I should also mention right so

375
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:56,760
middle boxes are a source of friction

376
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:59,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">get attention attention within the ITF</font>

377
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,530
right obviously they do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that many</font>

378
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,370
people find useful and many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

379
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,550
bought and

380
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:08,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">like many of them are they have also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> led</font>

381
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,409
to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ossification in many people's</font>

382
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,540
minds and so we're looking at things

383
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,730
like quick this major new effort which

384
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,350
is it would be designing a whole new

385
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:22,200
transport except that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to tunnel</font>

386
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:23,250
it inside UDP right so um well it's like

387
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,640
they used to say about the spider-man

388
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:29,490
comic right threat or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Menace right but</font>

389
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,470
in not people buy them for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason and</font>

390
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:36,230
they are you have to consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> them as an</font>

391
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,230
actor in your communications that's all

392
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:49,020
this chart oops<font color="#CCCCCC"> they jump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah um I</font>

393
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,760
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's anything here just</font>

394
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,660
to emphasize anything new from what we

395
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,110
just said the last two bullets

396
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,990
minimizing the clear information

397
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,110
exchange obviously some of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

398
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">be in the clear for network routing</font>

399
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris mentioned you know source</font>

400
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:07,559
destination IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> import right knee that 52</font>

401
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,960
portable to get package from here to

402
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:12,270
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else you should try</font>

403
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to encrypt as much as possible pls 13 is</font>

404
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:17,190
looking and encrypting most of the

405
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,800
initial exchanges not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

406
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">unfortunately quick is looking at also</font>

407
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,700
encrypting it and then there are people

408
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,399
who come in from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardware community</font>

409
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,260
who say well I need or the mobile

410
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,480
operators who say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to see what</font>

411
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,760
some of this stuff is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I can shape the</font>

412
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,130
traffic's to minimize the resource

413
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,710
consumption on my networks or on my

414
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,960
devices right and so if you're going to

415
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,610
disable how to prevent that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

416
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:46,230
have a good story<font color="#E5E5E5"> and explain what the</font>

417
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:48,059
trade-offs are ya if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

418
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,640
anything through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side channel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

419
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:56,910
will find it and it'll show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

420
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:59,790
WikiLeaks sure soft middle networks this

421
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,260
is the the malamar of networks right

422
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,480
it's got this hard crispy shell on the

423
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,629
outside and inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just all soft</font>

424
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,140
and gooey<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tasty there was a I forget</font>

425
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">who are comic was but he had like</font>

426
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,650
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a polar bear he's reaching down</font>

427
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,760
inside an igloo and go boy once you get

428
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,490
past the shell these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are delicious</font>

429
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,710
um and so that's a problem right people

430
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,810
put a lot of strength or a lot of

431
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,940
resources and both financial and

432
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:28,780
computing I'm protecting the perimeter

433
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:33,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they don't worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about as much about</font>

434
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:35,830
protecting the inside what happens I you

435
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,139
know typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples on the financial</font>

436
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,030
community you know the night cleaning

437
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,010
staff comes in and plugs in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop</font>

438
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,510
right or you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what mr. robot or</font>

439
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,460
some of these other shows right you just

440
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,320
plug in this USB stick on the net you

441
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,980
know you're good to go on because you've

442
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,960
got nothing partitioned internally yes

443
00:20:50,980 --> 00:21:00,400
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard outer shell and</font>

444
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:02,500
inside no protection at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so so</font>

445
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,600
just kind of keep going with that right

446
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,690
i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the problem there is if you</font>

447
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,149
can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that outer perimeter those</font>

448
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,740
outer perimeter defenses you're good

449
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,590
once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that toehold in the</font>

450
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,690
network you can move laterally laterally

451
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,149
through that network to get to almost

452
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,950
any resource you want to right and

453
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,650
that's that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

454
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,660
so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have your all of your</font>

455
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,260
authorization systems all of those

456
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,750
domains kind of tied together and easily

457
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:36,190
accessible<font color="#CCCCCC"> under that same that same</font>

458
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:37,900
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of soft middle then you're really</font>

459
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,430
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose that's really the kind of</font>

460
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:43,060
the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> over they'll have complete</font>

461
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:44,650
access to to everything right and that's

462
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,270
understanding the trust relationships

463
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,290
that you've built inside that network

464
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:54,460
and to go ahead the next slide yeah so

465
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:56,260
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to keep going so right so in</font>

466
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">your in your security considerations</font>

467
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,760
section if you're making assumptions

468
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,129
that that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case or what the</font>

469
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,110
case is what the trust relationships

470
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,770
necessary for your authorization model

471
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,689
your authentication model no it stated

472
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">right it makes it a lot easier to</font>

473
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,980
understand it may not need to go into

474
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">every draft but make sure you understand</font>

475
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the attack model is and how you</font>

476
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:23,170
were authenticated and securing your

477
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,910
your model right I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you're</font>

478
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:29,590
if you're planning something that uses

479
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:31,179
an enterprise security system which is

480
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,158
going to have you know kind of a larger

481
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:34,990
authentication system or if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

482
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed for something for home where</font>

483
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:40,419
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot lighter right and</font>

484
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,219
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that extent you want to employ at</font>

485
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:44,620
least privilege into your design as much

486
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,570
as possible so if something<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have</font>

487
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,969
to have kind of the full privilege in

488
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,668
various layers of your protocol your

489
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:55,090
stack then they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have kind</font>

490
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the full access yeah just one on the</font>

491
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,529
first bullet so we often<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about how</font>

492
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,110
the IETF doesn't really do

493
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:03,820
authentication and authorization right

494
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,729
it just wants to get the bites from here

495
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,629
to there whatever long whatever path and

496
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:13,750
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly as possible but there are</font>

497
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:16,809
facilities components they do care and

498
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,909
they do integrate bring into the model

499
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:22,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party agents such as you know</font>

500
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:24,549
WebRTC as a rendezvous point tran<font color="#CCCCCC"> term</font>

501
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">stun whatever they are they all have the</font>

502
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,029
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an introducer and so if</font>

503
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,640
you're doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

504
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:32,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">certificate transparency has the logs</font>

505
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,100
and then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of monitors who you know</font>

506
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,260
a watch the Watchers um so if you're

507
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">building one of these kinds of protocols</font>

508
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:45,970
um keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind that there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are multiple</font>

509
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:48,039
parties so we're making them and we're

510
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,919
going a lot faster than I anticipated if

511
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:55,830
you guys have questions comments or no

512
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,830
rotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> fruit but anything else feel free</font>

513
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,690
it's somewhat key terms might not turn

514
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,690
on the mic

515
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:24,190
okay all right it's off to<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet the</font>

516
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:27,340
network and the second question I won't

517
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:34,269
make sure that the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to i</font>

518
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:38,049
want to party that the internal network

519
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:41,279
begins up between the parity is not we

520
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:45,340
cannot transfer it right at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

521
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the first one is sort of easier don't</font>

522
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,939
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honor have you restate your</font>

523
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:51,340
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> question but soft middle because</font>

524
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,990
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a very hard exterior and a</font>

525
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,799
perimeter to keep it all the attackers

526
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:59,740
outside but if an attacker gets in it's

527
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,299
game<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right and we've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that with</font>

528
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,760
officer Office of Management and Budget

529
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:05,590
it we saw it with our essay for people

530
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,740
who know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've got past some of the</font>

531
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:10,480
border guards<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to just sit</font>

532
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,750
there for weeks or months collecting

533
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,929
data and excavation so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

534
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:20,019
that if you drew a series of concentric

535
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:21,580
circles and maybe they have a core set

536
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,299
of trusting machines in the enterprise

537
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,189
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they your authentication</font>

538
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:26,110
authorization and you've got the

539
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,840
workstations on everybody's desk and

540
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,760
then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ protecting</font>

541
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:35,559
everybody that layer in the middle is

542
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:40,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">the soft and crunchy and then what was</font>

543
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:43,299
your second question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I adjust Icarus why</font>

544
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:48,370
do you call it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> softer leader network</font>

545
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:50,440
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very popular net end of</font>

546
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:56,408
trail or not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your name it</font>

547
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:58,570
because I'm back<font color="#CCCCCC"> rimini so no popular it</font>

548
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:02,649
is we certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about it when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go</font>

549
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:06,668
do kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of incident response a lot and</font>

550
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:08,739
say you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

551
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:12,039
off-topic but you know you really should

552
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">be using more segmented design to to</font>

553
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:14,770
segregate out different departments and

554
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,010
that kind of stuff with authorization

555
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:19,629
domains within an enterprise network and

556
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,460
instead what we see here

557
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,100
often at enterprises that have been

558
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,450
infiltrated is they have a flat design

559
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,689
on the inside and everything is

560
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,550
dependent on being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect that</font>

561
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:34,090
that perimeter we call that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> soft</font>

562
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:39,760
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you I think I</font>

563
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:41,740
understand yeah no more clearly look

564
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,320
besides Swedish Institute of computer

565
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,850
science first a quick remark you just

566
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,100
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I def doesn't do authentication</font>

567
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:51,219
authorization I think that people at a

568
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:56,530
standoff would be very surprised to hear

569
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">deaths but well not my real question</font>

570
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:04,360
could you skip back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide about</font>

571
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:07,750
active attacks was pretty much in the

572
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning sorry for jumping back there's</font>

573
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:13,540
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> point about active attacks I think</font>

574
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:18,040
might be good to to highlight and to

575
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:20,620
raise awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and that is mix</font>

576
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,230
and match attax and delay attacks and

577

00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,750
IOT networks this can be very very

579
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:31,960
disasterous when the attacker just

580
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:34,300
switches to legitimate packets or delays

if you would like a suggestion to add

586
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:51,159
they're pretty powerful and and many

587
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:59,560
protocols are not well prepared to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font>

590
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,270
metadata I think me well maybe one idea

591
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,159
we could follow it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just simply follow</font>

592
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:11,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">bush</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I our terminology metadata is</font>

593
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,240
data simple get across all the nobody

594
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,919
has any<font color="#CCCCCC"> doubt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore what you're</font>

595
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,390
talking about so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're more</font>

596
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:21,150
explicit about it would make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier</font>

597
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:25,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">for people finished in metadata is data</font>

598
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:28,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah maybe it's protocol data</font>

599
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,950
versus the application data I think

600
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:33,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">because most of the protocols were</font>

601
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:35,290
designed is designed to carry data

602
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,420
then the other bits that are in there or

603
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:40,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to help the process happen but i</font>

604
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:44,020
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you metadata is data naive of</font>

605
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:46,030
novice level and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the Oghma I</font>

606
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">think a useful definition for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

607
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,649
difference is that that the data is the

608
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,330
stuff that i really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send and</font>

609
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,190
metadata is the stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

610
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,110
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to send but the network</font>

611
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,840
needs a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the application needs</font>

612
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,669
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> send just to get my data across so</font>

613
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,830
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the content of my email and</font>

614
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,050
then all that bunch of headers I don't

615
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,100
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the bunch of headers but</font>

616
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,720
email won't work without<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

617
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,860
headers so the bunch of headers is

618
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:15,010
metadata it's good put<font color="#E5E5E5"> vs. through play</font>

619
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:25,979
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but that's not okay I put in</font>

620
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:25,980
my yeah and that's obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong yeah</font>

621
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:35,440
so about the soft middle and think the

622
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:37,510
reason for that for that is the usually

623
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,900
a security team and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the networking team</font>

624
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,460
and the networking team want to be free

625
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,350
to do whatever they want to deploy

626
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,210
whatever way they want they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

627
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,919
the security team 10 and no you can you

628
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,510
have two segments here you have to put a

629
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:54,130
firewall here the security team can get

630
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:57,790
all the perimeter they can put as much

631
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:59,290
firewalls and ideas and proxies and

632
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,670
whatever they want on the perimeter

633
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,920
because that doesn't bother the

634
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,800
networking people but networking people

635
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:08,290
don't want them to interfere and I don't

636
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,180
have any idea how the ITF and have any

637
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:13,980
influence on that political internal

638
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:19,050
problem that lots of enterprises have

639
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,050
yeah now it's a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font>

640
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">more note on software of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

641
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">please move to microservices and sorry</font>

642
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:34,790
for the cloud club for the buzz word

643
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:38,190
clouds we will see more and more

644
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:40,260
segmented<font color="#E5E5E5"> perimeters like any enterprise</font>

645
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,930
network will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of parameters</font>

646
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:49,020
that is equal number of services<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide</font>

647
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:51,540
internal and external you're absolutely

648
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and and you know as we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outsource</font>

649
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:56,310
more functions to cloud it gets

650
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:03,510
infinitely more complicated and I

651
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:07,159
happily included none of that in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

652
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:09,920
so a couple words about DNS its

653
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:13,950
rendezvous protocol I want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

654
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:16,320
dub dub dub IETF our org and I have to

655
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:19,530
translate that into an IP address a set

656
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">of numbers for our pets or thirty two</font>

657
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:25,800
octets I mean um and it lets me then

658
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:28,020
communicate the name translation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

maps from human<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly human readable</font>

660
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,070

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,490
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first URL appeared on a TV ad I'm so</font>

662
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:38,129
many here and um so we were all aware of

663
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:42,020
these kinds of names into network

664
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:44,480
endpoints it is a distributed database

665
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,620
various people<font color="#CCCCCC"> all around the world</font>

666
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,620

authoritative or the recursive guy at

671
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,169
the end is providing the answer there's

672
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,820
no real security it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of works</font>

673
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:10,110
because people haven't messed with it

674
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:12,090
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much not a great state to be in</font>

675
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:16,830
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work going on in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn an aircraft carrier right</font>

678
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,770
you got to proceed very slowly and watch

679
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,940
out you don't hit any rocks um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

680
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,290
because almost every machine that's on

participating

685
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:41,490
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's plaintiffs both the protocol</font>

686
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,740
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that's in there and that</font>

687
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:47,210
can be secured nowadays that can be

691
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:57,060
more on on some of these other records

692
00:32:54,090 --> 00:33:00,840
right so server records and you know how

693
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:03,840
how DNS plays into 509 certificates

694
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,350
right so server records are great<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

695
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:11,100
can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up what your LDAP controller or</font>

696
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:13,320
your ad is on your local network so when

697
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,659
you plug in your your favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

698
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,300
to your enterprise network it does that

699
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:21,510
request and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then after it learns it</font>

700
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:23,070
memorizes that answer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you leave</font>

701
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,530
your enterprise network and go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

702
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:28,350
favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel it still asks for that</font>

703
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:30,120
answer so wherever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> work when you</font>

704
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,980
walk into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hotel and connect to its</font>

705
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,889
what you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's public Wi-Fi network</font>

706
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,710
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine is asking for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your ad name</font>

707
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:41,310
and not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> public version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actual</font>

708
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:44,550
ad name in your enterprise so DNS really

709
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:46,560
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of information in there and</font>

710
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:49,260
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably leaking information</font>

711
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,139
about how your enterprise is configured

712
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,760
every time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave the building and</font>

713
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that is 509</font>

714
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,370
certificates are generally tied to DNS

715
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:02,010
names and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take over DNS in</font>

716
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:06,000
any way than all of your certificate

717
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:10,880
chain signing and that that chain can be

718
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,880
compromised just by taking at DNS

00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:21,210
well yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll keep God so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS is a</font>

720
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:23,130
thing for me so we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody should</font>

721
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,168
probably be familiar with the active

722
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,970
attacks against DNS I mean cache

723
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:28,949
poisoning always gets a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of play</font>

724
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:32,790
whenever it happens we know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:34,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kaminski attack which you the linchpin</font>

726
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,840
of security to DNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests in the</font>

727
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:40,649
response is the randomized request

728
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,570
number and if you can intercept that you

729
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:45,299
can you can give back any answer you

730
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,940
want by injecting a packet with whatever

731
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,570
response you want before the the actual

732
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:53,070
dns server does right so that's pretty

733
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,260
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> a race condition it's built into</font>

734
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:58,740
the protocol that's how the protocol

735
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:02,250
works so that's that's one big problem

736
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,049
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS that said we have some we have</font>

737
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,540
some drafts we well they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

738
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:11,070
drafts right we have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC's on</font>

739
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:13,380
doing DNS over pls we have DNS SEC which

740
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:15,270
signs the DNS responses which means that

741
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,150
you can check to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the response is</font>

742
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,830
really the correct response we need

743
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:24,060
those to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more deployed than they are</font>

744
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:27,650
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so dropping below that</font>

745
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:30,390
set we have passive observation right so

746
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:32,280
as we just kind of mentioned the vast

747
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:36,210
majority of DNS really happens in the in

748
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:38,460
the clear text you know just by

749
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:41,190
observing something like someone going

against if we go the whole way back to

762
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:15,589
the kill chain so observing<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS really</font>

763
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,590
tells you a lot of information

764
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:26,750
so as a result you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when you're</font>

765
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:30,110
using DNS in your protocol is most of

766
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:33,800
them do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to understand you know</font>

what the how Pat compact the sand is

that you're building<font color="#E5E5E5"> your foundation up</font>

769
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:43,160
right so security considerations subject

770
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:45,439
to all the weaknesses of DNS now if

771
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,270
you're using TLS and go certificate that

772
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,500
you can in max that name against what

773
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,350
you thought the name was that you're

774

777
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:02,630

know a simply very simple password

knowing what somebody is doing is risky

806
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:17,480
to that person and therefore you want to

807
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:20,720
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't add to the risk</font>

with the home network are captive to

their ISPs DNS

00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,470
for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> it used to be a fad that</font>

814
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:39,640
if you type the bogus address in the

815
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:42,709
browser bar you get an ad from your isp

816
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:44,060
godaddy this domain for sale because

817
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,920
what they did is they said oh this name

818
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,830
doesn't exist<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll send you over to here</font>

are my captive ad server so

00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:53,150
understanding who the parties are and

821
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,180
who is controlled by him or whose

worldview is controlled by who is

00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,620
another consideration keep involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

824
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:09,200
just went on and on Guinness javonni's

825
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:10,850
idea yeah I'm just worried about as well

826
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,649
did those attacks on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS because</font>

827
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,750
they make a perfect target we have seen

00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,210
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take down Guinness providers like</font>

the classic dine tech Twitter Netflix

830
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:22,430
all had problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so I know you guys</font>

831
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't talk before about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D does but it's</font>

832
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:28,790
a problem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ENS is a perfect place</font>

833
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:30,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">for do those yes so if that's a pretty</font>

834
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:32,750
interesting one and considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

835
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,030
most of the protections that can

836
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:38,690
reasonably be taken and you look kind of

837
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:40,520
dying you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were pretty well</font>

838
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">armored to an attack like that yet it</font>

839
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,750
still succeeded right and in DNS is the

840
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:47,540
lynches the rendezvous protocol that

841
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,520
ties these things together and so we'll

842
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,960
touch on that if I actually make it

843
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,420
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of Things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

844
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">about like please stop putting bad</font>

845
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:00,350
influence on the net yeah sure it never

846
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:02,299
as a side note when you see layers what

847
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,830
you dos attacks could be targeted it can

848
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,410
be a bandwidth it could be an

849
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:09,259
application layer right but it also can

850
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:11,569
be of course tcp/ip stack and point

851
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:14,210
tcp/ip stack but last but not least the

852
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:16,610
infrastructure all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SICU penza</font>

853
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,500
forwards and process the packets because

854
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:20,510
you can also be attacked its it is

855
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,280
frequently<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked if you're any</font>

856
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:24,500
network it can bring your you have a

857
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,690
doubt competing like all the routers

858
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:30,290
essentially so even in payless layer

859
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:34,790
will fall apart but as in all

860
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:38,450
competitions of armor vs sabbath charge

861
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:40,880
it's always attackers go where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

862
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:42,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">softer right now we're well fortified on</font>

863
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,539
application layer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> badly spice</font>

864
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,839
reasonably well but

865
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:49,759
I expect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax on infrastructure will</font>

866
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,189
rise<font color="#CCCCCC"> in numbers in next decade</font>

867
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:56,109
dramatically so it's important to

868
00:40:52,189 --> 00:40:56,109
consider how we protect infrastructure

869
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,009
ok but so I'm yet so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> caveat</font>

870
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:11,839
the neither one of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you know</font>

871
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:14,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing experts so you know you can sump</font>

872
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:17,179
the chump at the mic right now but so

873
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:19,129
here's another piece of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

874
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:22,579
routing right so that the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> version</font>

875
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:24,949
you know we you know autonomous systems

876
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:29,390
advertise their little slice of heaven

877
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:31,400
to the world via bgp right and so you

878
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:34,279
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes that prefix it goes</font>

879
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,169
upstream in the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of the</font>

880
00:41:34,279 --> 00:41:38,390
world right you know you may aggravate

881
00:41:36,169 --> 00:41:43,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you may forward that along to</font>

882
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:46,029
another connection etc right the real

883
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:49,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing here is we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of</font>

884
00:41:46,029 --> 00:41:52,459
reasonably good recommendations and best

885
00:41:49,669 --> 00:41:55,848
practices about how to deal with routing

886
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:58,038
and routing filtering and that isn't

887
00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:02,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">even getting into some of the some of</font>

888
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:04,219
the other parts but from a security

889
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:06,890
research point of view we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

890
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:09,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">appreciate if folks would actually start</font>

891
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:13,150
you know executing some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidance</font>

892
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:17,390
a little bit more go to the next slide

893
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:19,459
yeah so so just a handful of fun routing

894
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:22,038
events that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know kind of related</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

895
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:23,868
please do filtering and please pay

896
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:26,169
attention and you know some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

897
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:28,519
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit older</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than others but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

898
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:30,769
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pakistan attempts to block</font>

899
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:35,629
YouTube but<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertises prefix globally</font>

900
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:38,658
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube down across the net you</font>

901
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:41,359
know if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a if you're running bgp</font>

902
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:43,159
on your infrastructure and you know

903
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,759
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing an advertisement from</font>

904
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:49,309
someone that says I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube maybe you</font>

905
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:54,669
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> think twice about accepting that</font>

906
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:57,529
advertisement china telecom sends out

907
00:42:54,669 --> 00:42:58,308
37,000 prefixes in 15 minutes hijacking

908
00:42:57,529 --> 00:43:00,859
large parts of the

909
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:03,650
internet through<font color="#CCCCCC"> China the spectacular</font>

910
00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:06,019
point about that one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if in china</font>

911
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:08,089
telecom's case they actually have the

912
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:10,839
bandwidth to absorb the onslaught that

913
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:16,339
came from advertising all of those and

914
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:18,229
routed it back out successfully so China

915
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:21,739
Telecom actually absorbed it sent it

916
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:23,808
back out people did notice but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

917
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:25,279
15 minutes china telecom actually

918
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:28,249
rerouted the internet through<font color="#CCCCCC"> China and</font>

919
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:32,420
back out without losing data more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

920
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:35,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">less and now for the parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of please</font>

921
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,979
filter your the advertisements because

922
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:44,749
it's actually malicious is in February

923
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:46,999
2009-14 2014<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canadian ISP was a hack and</font>

924
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:50,569
it was used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to redirect traffic from</font>

925
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:53,479
ISPs selectively in generally in short

926
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:55,249
segments of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 seconds it was used</font>

927
00:43:53,479 --> 00:43:58,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that to interrupt Bitcoin in</font>

928
00:43:55,249 --> 00:44:00,618
Bitcoin mining so there are real cases

929
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:05,719
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use these kind of attacks</font>

930
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:10,069
to to a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great effect there was</font>

931
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:16,699
amazing ki studied by dine at last NOC

932
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:18,859
whereas they decomposed latest known BGP

933
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:20,839
hijacking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> by what done by one</font>

934
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:23,869
American company<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other American</font>

935
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:26,839
company so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> glad the covert you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

936
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:29,179
slides yeah so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean this stuff really</font>

937
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:30,739
does happen there's some comprehensive

938
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:34,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">databases out there I don't really put</font>

939
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:36,289
it in here but you know route views

940
00:44:34,249 --> 00:44:39,140
which does some pretty comprehensive

941
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:41,029
capturing of BGP unfortunately that's

942
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:43,189
going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let you look back</font>

943
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:44,630
and see after the fact what happened so

944
00:44:43,189 --> 00:44:46,038
we'll be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand the attacks</font>

945
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:48,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of stuff does nothing</font>

946
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:49,759
about preventing them now right and so

947
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:52,939
what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do to prevent them now we</font>

948
00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:56,779
can do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> better in filtering bgp sec</font>

949
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:58,399
it's a hard adoption problem you know it

950
00:44:56,779 --> 00:45:01,519
is adoption last<font color="#E5E5E5"> i looked is still</font>

951
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,759
around six and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a half percent you can</font>

952
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:07,038
also do moniteur roads globally and find

953
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:09,500
all the route leaks and close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to real</font>

954
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,200
time critics from right

955
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,250
[Music]

956
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:19,598
CC do exactly that well we also do that

957
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:22,119
and I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this university research</font>

958
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,369
team with<font color="#CCCCCC"> hazel area at atalia also does</font>

959
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:28,240
very interesting research in terms of

960
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:29,829
detection in next real time yes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

961
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,899
comment so one of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> events that</font>

962
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:35,050
i didn't put in here was a leak<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

963
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,760
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Brazil and if I'm incorrectly</font>

964
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:39,700
implicating somebody I apologized

965
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,099
already we're ripe detected it within

966
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,899
you know a minute or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and that attack</font>

967
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:46,750
with that was an attack that was a Miss

968
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,210
configuration and that was you know

969
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:52,180
stopped after maybe two minutes of

970
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:54,490
activity where the right monitoring

971
00:45:52,180 --> 00:46:01,180
really found it in kind of and and did

972
00:45:54,490 --> 00:46:02,470
that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but so in general there's</font>

973
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,879
a set of folks are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be working</font>

974
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:05,740
on a routing and then there's a whole

975
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,720
bunch of the rest of us who aren't

976
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,118
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on routing who might be working</font>

977
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,399
on something like authentication using

978
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:15,160
OAuth or something and you should

979
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,869
understand that the path you should make

980
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,210
no dependencies in your protocol on the

981
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:21,640
path of packet takes you shouldn't

982
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:25,270
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path the pack it takes is</font>

983
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,879
reproducible right because any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

984
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:30,310
vgp advertisement may potentially you

985
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,290
know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know perturb those</font>

986
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:35,349
routing paths such they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

987
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,970
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up again likely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in your lifetime so</font>

988
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:39,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">anytime you think that you can trace</font>

989
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">route backwards and know how a packet</font>

990
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,940
got to you and you know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

991
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:44,828
attacker is yeah stop thinking that way

992
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,450
that didn't likely that's not the case

993
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:49,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't even cover asymmetric</font>

994
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:51,700
routing which is a lot more common than

995
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,589
people want so unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're really kind</font>

996
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,750
of located router to router next to

997
00:46:53,589 --> 00:47:00,160
whatever enterprise you see that traffic

998
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:01,869
on stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that the other part about</font>

999
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,430
this is you know understanding that that

1000
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:05,800
your network connectivity even though a

1001
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,450
packet may go from the endpoint you you

1002
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,700
have to the endpoint you want to go to

1003
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:11,919
it may be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through places you don't</font>

1004
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,990
want or don't think it's going through

1005
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on rattling attacks and you may</font>

1006
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:17,950
not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that in asymmetric</font>

1007
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:19,720
cases so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all things you need</font>

1008
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,069
to you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the mic though</font>

these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all things you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1010
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:25,150
have to pay attention to right so

1011
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:27,848
understand what your trust anchors are

1012
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:30,390
and and and how your<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentic is there</font>

1013
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:34,210
would be one beautiful illustration how

1014
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:37,410
things might get one with<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP for</font>

1015
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:40,569
example certificate authorities for TLS

1016
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:44,170
the exercise one particular never

1017
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:46,329
throughout each cake you as a person or

1018

<font color="#CCCCCC">its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business which can be exploited</font>

00:47:53,559 --> 00:48:00,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">two men in the middle so exact case when</font>

1022
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:04,119
people were relying on something they

1023
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:08,339
would sink is fundamental it's secure

1024
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:12,039
but in fact it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

1025
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:17,140
amazingly bad practice to do that

1026
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:19,210
version you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet of Things so this is just my</font>

random things on there that create

things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the muri botnet right don't</font>

1035
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,710
put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> backdoor in there that can't be</font>

00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:53,549
on some kind of reasonably regular basis

00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:56,349
when you build your device you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1041
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:57,759
please secure your software updates and

1042
00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:01,990
make the device software<font color="#CCCCCC"> updateable</font>

1043
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,849
please actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use crypto these are all</font>

1044
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,479
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like to see in devices</font>

1045

00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:28,270
an Internet go ahead specific to an

1052
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:32,440
Internet of Things device right there

1053
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:35,259
the same as as you know kind of any

1054
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,270
other endpoint on the internet there's

1055
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,980
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know really kind of two possible</font>

1056
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:42,280
differentiators on

1057
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:43,630
Internet of Things devices but far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1058
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,980
I'm concerned from a security point of

1059
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:47,590
view right they may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot less</font>

1060
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:50,650
computational power and potentially

1061
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:52,119
their cyber physical so maybe this

1062
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,160
device that's on the internet actually

1063
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:57,820
can open a door or window or turn a

1064
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,859
light on or off you know maybe you can

1065
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,830
unlock your house that's another

1066
00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:05,230
security issue and in and of itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1067
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:09,609
fundamentally when I look at it I want

1068
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:12,100
strong endpoint security in general yeah

1069
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:15,640
just just before we get to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1070
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:19,060
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find interesting about IOT is or</font>

1071
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,890
any as I've seen discussions about any

1072
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:23,440
particular crypto algorithm or a

1073
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:25,540
particular you know certificate data

1074
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,160
format or whatever it is somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1075
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,830
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a use case in a part number</font>

1076
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,560
where this piece is too small to do that

1077
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:36,819
like all I can handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know rot13</font>

1078
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:39,340
shift everything over<font color="#E5E5E5"> half and my part</font>

1079
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:42,040
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs ten cents on a camera that</font>

1080
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:44,140
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> only selling for nineteen dollars so</font>

1081
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,550
the economics really make themselves

1082
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:51,609
visible the concern or a concern is

1083
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:55,600
those same design criteria are also

1084
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:57,250
being used in things like cars right

1085
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,160
we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see cars get over the</font>

1086
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:01,900
over the air software updates or<font color="#CCCCCC"> vehicle</font>

1087
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">to vehicle communication is working with</font>

1088
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:07,420
here um mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost a lot more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than $19</font>

1089
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:09,220
US dollars right whatever and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1090
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 10-cent part doing all of</font>

1091
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:14,609
the crypto work in there but they seem

1092
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,609
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from the same mindset of people</font>

1093
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:20,890
and while a bad guy being able to flip

1094
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:22,569
my lights on it off as annoying a bad

1095
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:27,480
guy being able to cause my car to

1096
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:27,480
accelerate is way<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than a normal</font>

1097
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:34,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so so back to the unit kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1098
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,799
the dial service right so if you put

1099
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:38,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those devices on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

1100
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,490
I guess it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be maybe I have a sick</font>

1101
00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:41,020
sense of humor would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be interesting to</font>

1102
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">see when the cars can do a denial of</font>

1103
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:50,589
service attack against DNS into this

1104
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:52,599
driving down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the highway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1105
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:56,170
so one of the other things we really

1106
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:57,579
kind of see as a and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I don't</font>

1107
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:59,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a good answer for you right which</font>

1108
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:02,349
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of asymmetric protocols they're</font>

1109
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:05,680
spectacular for denial of service if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1110
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:10,390
can send a small request to to a service

1111
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:12,940
and the response really out sizes that

1112
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:14,979
that small request and I can point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1113
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:18,819
response at something else then I've

1114
00:52:14,979 --> 00:52:25,419
really amplified my ability to to kind

1115
00:52:18,819 --> 00:52:26,739
of do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so no oh no he's</font>

1116
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,359
telling me I can't do it that's a

1117
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:30,940
symmetric protocols without

1118
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:33,400
objectification well another so I'm

1119
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,839
actually what I'm the skin resident but

1120
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,150
that's exactly where I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

1121
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:38,650
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if if you really have the need</font>

1122
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:42,400
of building that kind of asymmetric

1123
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:43,839
protocol really we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want the</font>

1124
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,309
authentication we want the strength in

1125
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:48,989
there that makes it so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

1126
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:51,940
send that<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a spoofed location</font>

1127
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:57,450
right so don't create this kind of

1128
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:57,450
amplification ability for folks right

1129
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:04,539
you would be where<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero round trip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1130
00:53:01,809 --> 00:53:06,309
TLS 13 because the TLS handshake is

1131
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:09,369
asymmetric right the client connects the

1132
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:12,099
surest to do some work<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now you can</font>

1133
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:14,349
do in essence<font color="#E5E5E5"> UDP style attacks at the</font>

1134
00:53:12,099 --> 00:53:15,729
TCP level where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't care if the</font>

1135
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:20,009
server gets back to you you just want to

1136
00:53:15,729 --> 00:53:22,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring them down and so that's an issue</font>

1137
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:25,239
yeah an occasion helps but sometimes the

1138
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:27,808
authentication protocol requires an

1139
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:37,660
asymmetric amount of work on both sides

1140
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:40,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">on either side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you said about unit</font>

1141
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:42,879
economics for IOT right and there is

1142
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:45,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">just no place for good engineering but</font>

1143
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,130
there is a good consideration in case of

1144
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:50,710
when you compare it to the car so I did

1145
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:53,289
really an expensive car and the eunuch

1146
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:55,089
economics aren't great so I have no

1147
00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:58,509
brakes and they take it to the public

1148
00:53:55,089 --> 00:54:00,759
roads but pardon me this is my unit

1149
00:53:58,509 --> 00:54:03,750
economics should we allow these cars on

1150
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:05,190
public roads that

1151
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:07,290
so we do see that happening right now

1152
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:10,710
with tractors in the Midwest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

1153
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:12,180
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> because right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there downloading an</font>

1154
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:14,490
illegal firmware from the Ukraine

1155
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:18,480
because John Deere will let them operate

1156
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:21,089
it it's economics are starting to really

1157
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,430
make their presence known in designing

1158
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,750
security stuff that's it they're really

1159
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:26,339
interested is either really interesting

1160
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:33,960
or cool or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just another source of</font>

1161
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:37,110
frustration how you will measure things

1162
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:41,550
like down time of dying when cap of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:43,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">East Coast was offline is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive</font>

1164
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:47,990
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more expensive or less expensive</font>

1167
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:58,259
quick comment on some of the work that's

1168
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:59,609
already going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they had there's</font>

1169
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,710
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> other working groups who are</font>

1170
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:04,650
tackling some part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or have some</font>

1171
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:07,770
interest in in these topics you know

1172
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of related to to you know Internet</font>

1173
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:11,850
of Things what does it mean to have kind

1174
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:14,240
of a safe home network a safe small

1175
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:19,049
device what's a low-power how do i do

1176
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:21,479
small object our small signing of data

1177
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:24,720
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to a limited</font>

1178
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,730
compute limited device so there's a

1179
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,220
bunch of work on there and there's a lot

1180
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">of guidance go look at this draft which</font>

1181
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:35,069
i think is either expiring or expired

1182
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:37,350
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got a group at unev references</font>

1183
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:42,890
of places<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go get some more guidance</font>

1184
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:42,890
on on i'm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these topics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1185
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:50,040
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for all the time we</font>

1186
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:52,680
have five more minutes right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1187
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">right what not to do right don't invent</font>

1188
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,060
a new security mechanism unless you

1189
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:59,460
really really have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then please</font>

1190
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:03,509
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do go invent the security a new</font>

1191
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:05,430
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank is you know i'm all for</font>

1192
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:07,410
kind of the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on pls and doing those</font>

1193
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,850
updates and we should leverage the

1194
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:12,149
places where we're building those kind

1195
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:16,170
of secure components and leverage those

1196
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:17,080
as much as off as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> in inventing</font>

1197
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:19,450
secure

1198
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:23,290
mechanisms everywhere is a real problem

1199
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:25,990
right and don't redefine security terms

1200
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:28,570
for something else in your draft it

1201
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:31,330
drives at least this person who's

1202
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:32,980
reviewed documents absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy when</font>

1203
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:36,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">you decided that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to have a</font>

1204
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:50,380
nonce and it's not a nonce things like

1205
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:53,279
that yeah don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that no if you have a</font>

1206
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:56,500
you undo it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure so I'll be the problem</font>

1207
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,450
with the optimist um so what to do the

1208
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:02,710
crypto forum is a working group within

1215
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:23,380
I got this great no Krypto algorithm um

1216
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:25,930
they'll tell you to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away I reasonably</font>

1221
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:40,870
does this right they picked one

communicating what kind of protections

you want to have or you would like to

have but can't see a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve right</font>

1238
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:22,870
now even just putting down the

1239
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,190
unanswered questions early on on the

1240
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:25,779
draft will help and people will

1241
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:28,180
volunteer to help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that stuff</font>

out understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boundary is are</font>

00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:48,249
security track mechanisms I don't know

1251
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:53,259
what the question is but the answer is

1252
00:58:48,249 --> 00:58:54,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost always going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TLS and ask</font>

that and presented ideas that have you

00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:15,069
know people have adopted there's a

brought up recently so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah ask for help</font>

1262
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,319
don't go off and try to invent something

1263
00:59:23,819 --> 00:59:29,920
one minute one minute so fishing yeah

1264
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:33,549
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a security consideration</font>

1265
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:35,440
thing but because it still works I think

1266
00:59:33,549 --> 00:59:38,319
if you pay any attention to the news

1267
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:41,859
especially in the US where we've managed

1268
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:44,019
to fish the election yet clearly fishing

1269
00:59:41,859 --> 00:59:46,058
still works please don't click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there are some sites that have fishes in</font>

1274
00:59:54,519 --> 01:00:00,008

link in it but yeah this you know if we

1281
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,450
look at initial vectors into infections

1282
01:00:16,979 --> 01:00:21,549
email is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> really high up on the</font>

1284
01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:25,989
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> because email still works if</font>

01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:28,078
you have a large<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>
