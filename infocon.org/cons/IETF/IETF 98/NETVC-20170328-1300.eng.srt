<font color="#E5E5E5">free standard at the output of this work</font>

80
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:16,930
make sure you review that any comments

81
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,930
on the agenda before we get started

have a new chairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so going on to</font>

84
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:44,030
the first item reviewing our work of

85
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:47,540
documents in my son's so we have a first

86
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:49,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">mass</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plan of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a July last year which</font>

87
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,680
we've obviously exceeded and that was

88
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,830
the requirements and testing evaluation

89
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,989
criteria documents if we choose to

90
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,970
publish them as information and we did

91
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,440
decide to choose to publish them so

92
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,450
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question here but</font>

93
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously this that's will update the</font>

94
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,970
milestone<font color="#CCCCCC"> two may kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of aggressive</font>

95
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,390
what we think there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not much left to</font>

96
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,680
do we already did our work with class

97
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,810
code requirements last time but they've

98
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,060
been some changes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jose's going to</font>

99
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,469
review that that are probably a little

100
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,390
bit more than editorial so we will

101
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:24,200
restart over class call for two weeks

102
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:26,240
after this meeting and I believe we're

103
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,500
ready to start the work group last call

104
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,370
and testing but we'll wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> until after</font>

105
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:34,520
the VR testing presentation to to make

106
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> call but the goal is to get most</font>

107
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,890
both of those done by by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main</font>

108
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,890
milestone now

109
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:48,300
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're other many milestones the</font>

110
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:51,389
Codex specs and the reference

111
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,399
implementations of them were due<font color="#CCCCCC"> in may</font>

112
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:56,009
I don't think there's any reasonable way

113
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,550
that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplished so we're going</font>

114
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:01,740
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take those milestones to December and</font>

115
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:05,008
there's also a storage format spec which

116
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,420
there has not been any activity on so

117
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:09,689
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also being updated to December</font>

118
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,769
but I'd note that without even any

119
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:15,000
individual drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that there's a</font>

120
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,490
probably unlikely that that December

121
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,529
date will hold and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally there's</font>

122
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,939
a test result not yet which again has

123
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:22,319
not been started but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should be</font>

124
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">relatively straightforward after the</font>

125
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:27,649
testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluation criteria stabilizes</font>

126
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:37,758
this should just be a simple output of

127
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:37,759
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> document all right let's look for</font>

128
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:58,780
administrative part let's go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> jose's</font>

129
00:14:44,650 --> 00:15:04,360
going to present remotely would be just

130
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:06,220
Tommy's day oh yeah so we have a

131
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,900
different projector in this room because

132
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:12,240
we requested a high-resolution projector

133
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,240
and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it gets me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

134
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:22,780
so the slide should be on vm again<font color="#CCCCCC"> wet</font>

down the slides and<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh and flip them</font>

147
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,620
annually sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but those in</font>

150
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,620
so Jose

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:46,310
is he in<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem coming</font>

152
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:09,319
hello can you hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> me yes thank you very</font>

153
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:12,589
much so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon everybody this is</font>

154
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,349
a quick presentation on the net VC and

155
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:22,629
requirements this is the version number

00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:25,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">five of the document next page please so</font>

157
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:30,679
it it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty quick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

158
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:32,660
are changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the applications some</font>

159
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,730
editorial changes some changes to the

160
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:38,260
requirements and nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

161
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:42,740
evaluation methodology next page please

162
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:45,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">slaughter it so in the applications we</font>

163
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,590
we did some changes to the introduction

164
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:51,200
some editorial changes the important

165
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:57,199
change here is to the video monitoring

166
00:17:51,200 --> 00:18:00,230
and surveillance application where we we

167
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:04,090
change the rates that we had originally

168
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:07,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">so for the 1080p we had originally only</font>

169
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:12,290
25 frames per second and now we added

170
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:14,809
both 25 and 34 5 megapixels we added low

171
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:17,899
frame rate as well since for

172
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:20,330
surveillance in many cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quality</font>

173
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,640
of the pictures is what is important and

174
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:28,070
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily the frame rate so we</font>

175
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:32,179
added a 12 frame rate in 25 and 30 for

176
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:36,950
adding higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> temporal resolutions and</font>

177
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:41,929
for the 4k case as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we went from the</font>

178
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:44,809
low frame rate to adding 25 and 30 so

179
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:47,750
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover a wider range of</font>

180
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:50,120
surveillance applications and that's

181
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:55,970
that's that for the application section

182
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:58,189
next page please smartform so there were

183
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:03,950
some changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the general requirement</font>

184
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:07,970
and that was mostly for section<font color="#CCCCCC"> 31 1 and</font>

185
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">3 dot one dot 343 dot one dot one what</font>

186
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:12,950
we wanted to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mention</font>

187
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">compression performance</font>

188
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,770
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the compression performance</font>

189
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:21,320
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for both what we call easy</font>

190
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:24,650
material and difficult material for

191
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,689
natural content so that is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font>

192
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see improvements not just in the easy</font>

193
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,400
scenes but also in scenes that have a

194
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:35,260
lot of detail a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> motion and so</font>

195
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:39,830
that was the thinking in changing the

196
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:45,470
the wording for for that section also to

197
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:49,070
add explicitly call for screen content

198
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,680
sharing for both moving which is static

199
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:54,139
and also dynamic screen content sharing

200
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:57,500
so that's a that that was the changes to

201
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:01,580
that requirement for three dot one dot

202
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:04,400
three we had mentioned syntax that would

203
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:07,460
allow extensibility but we wanted to

204
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">make clear that this is explicitly the</font>

205
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,800
bitstream syntax and that we recommend

206
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:15,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is backward compatibility and</font>

207
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:20,690
so in this case backward compatibility

208
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:23,540
means that the changes to will not

209
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,510
affect legacy decoders and by legacy we

210
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:30,770
mean just simply decoders that are that

211
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:33,170
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working at a specific profiling</font>

212
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:37,010
level will not be affected by future

213
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:40,400
changes to the to the encoder so that's

214
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:44,120
really they'll take the the essence of

215
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:48,890
the changes for 313 so backward

216
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:52,399
compatibility for a specific profile in

217
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,800
level next<font color="#CCCCCC"> please so just before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">in that so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on this is what I</font>

219
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought there the changes would be</font>

220
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,100
really more than editorial and I think

221
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,900
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reset the worker</font>

222
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,449
class call so I'd ask the worker to

223
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,460
please review this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is more</font>

224
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,890
of a substantive change and we should

225
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,650
realize what this means that explicitly

226
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:16,300
calling out screen sharing performance

227
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:18,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">being part of the target you know it is</font>

228
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">significant and you know requiring</font>

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:24,500

232
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,200
a quite a requirement to so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said were</font>

233
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,750
quick to please review those during the

234
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,030
next the last call and make sure you

235
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:42,100
weigh in<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your views on them now note</font>

236
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:46,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in other spec in other standards</font>

237
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:48,590
for example in<font color="#CCCCCC"> hevc they're the first</font>

238
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,380
version did not have any target for

239
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,970
screen sharing performance and it's not

240
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">until version for that was just</font>

241
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:58,630
published a few months ago where screen

242
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,310
coding performance actually ended up

243
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:04,670
being significantly better and if we're

244
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:07,580
setting our bar relative to<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font>

245
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,140
standards now this is even a more

246
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,540
important thing to keep in mind

247
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:14,330
twenty-five percent of better than the

248
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:25,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">latest december state-of-the-art is a</font>

249
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:36,560
pretty significant undertaking any other

250
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:40,870
comments um not go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead hoser</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

251
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:46,750
next next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please that's life I've</font>

252
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:48,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so for the basic requirement there</font>

253
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:52,090
so we just went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the general</font>

254
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:55,870
requirements now for basic requirements

255
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:58,250
there was a change to support of

256
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:01,340
efficient random access point encoding

257
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,770
we had that before such as inter coding

258
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,540
or resending of context variables as

259
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,850
well as efficient switching between

260
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,860
multiple quality representation so this

261
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:14,689
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we we talked about</font>

262
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:19,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">before that would be a requirement in</font>

263
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to allow efficient random access</font>

264
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:28,670
encoding<font color="#E5E5E5"> for three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dot-to-dot three that</font>

265
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:33,680
has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with complexity and here what</font>

266
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:34,340
we wanted to add is a specific sentence

267
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,289
that

268
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,449
would point towards reasonable

269
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:40,669
complexity of hardware and software and

270
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:44,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">color implementations compared to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

271
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:46,520
we have today is as always we had in the

272
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:48,799
document well still we we still have in

273
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,080
the document requirements that for the

274
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,720
high quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding the encoder should</font>

275
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,740
not be ten times as complex as what we

276
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,360
have today but this particular paragraph

277
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:03,470
compares with the current state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

278
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:07,399
art which is EP 9 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 265 and so that's</font>

279
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:09,830
that's the the added text or for this

280
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:12,070
and by meaningful improvement we mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

281
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:17,299
say that there's improvements that are

282
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:20,418
visible whether we in whatever way that

283
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:23,510
we decide to to evaluate them whether

284
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:26,210
subjectively or objectively and then

285
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:29,990
there were no changes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text for</font>

286
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:38,270
the optional requirements on any

287
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:42,020
comments on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and that's uh that's</font>

288
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:47,510
mostly young Jim Carrey from missoula

289
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:49,760
arm so just a question about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

290
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,500
better all right Tim character from

<font color="#CCCCCC">missoula just a question about the first</font>

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:59,029
bullet<font color="#E5E5E5"> point here arm do this doesn't</font>

293
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:02,000
say much about when you have to be able

294
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:06,049
to do this switching arm is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

295
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,779
estimation that something like arm you

296
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:10,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">know periodic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aligned keyframes across</font>

297
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:12,289
multiple quality resolutions would be

298
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:17,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">good enough or do you envision this as</font>

299
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:19,429
requiring something like s frames I Tim

300
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:21,980
I I missed the last statement that you

301
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:24,440
made um do you envision this as

302
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,350
requiring something like s rains or with

303
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,450
periodic arm aligned keyframes be

304
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,129
sufficient to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet this requirement yeah</font>

305
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,890
I think that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sufficient to meet</font>

306
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:38,740
that requirement correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then I</font>

307
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,740
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

308
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:55,139
good and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> select space is 50 under</font>

309
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,820
peach<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for jose's benefit their the</font>

310
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:01,140
quick exchange<font color="#CCCCCC"> their Tim will be sending</font>

311
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:08,010
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pros text to the list on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font>

312
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:13,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">you just one more question looking for</font>

313
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:15,330
Mike for Mike there was I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

314
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:19,799
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dips for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the for this change I</font>

315
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:22,590
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was also an added definition</font>

316
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:24,960
of profiles and levels and I think

317
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,689
that's probably important to call out

318
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,090
have people review what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

319
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:33,659
defining what profiles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what levels</font>

320
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:36,658
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec should have but defining</font>

321
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:38,940
what is constituting a profile what is

322
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:41,240
constituting a lovely could be something

323
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:51,630
importantly we're reviewing coming on

324
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:53,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so thank you so</font>

325
00:26:51,630 --> 00:27:00,990
those are the changes from the previous

326
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:03,350
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and like we said we're</font>

327
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:06,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start a workup last call um</font>

328
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:08,668
starting on now for two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a la</font>

329
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,899
so we get all the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and</font>

330
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:13,169
please we need some more reviewers on

331
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:16,200
this document look we haven't enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

332
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">pausing feedback on it yet to a natural</font>

333
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,770
at the residence in a lot you give any

334
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:24,620
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hands of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone that's willing to</font>

335
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:27,929
review all right for the notes Tim

336
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:32,070
anyone else such a pretty short document

337
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:40,520
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates or even shorter Dave all</font>

338
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you thank you thanks Jose</font>

339
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:53,689
so next up is um Thomas to talk about

340
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:56,179
testing and he's also going to do it

341
00:27:53,690 --> 00:28:12,789
remotely so Thomas if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

342
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:12,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the mic q me dekha is he on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

343
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:22,619
see and hear you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool and I can't</font>

344
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:25,979
or my slides up I can't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all there</font>

345
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:29,279
we go now I can see um so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

346
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:31,320
present the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next update of ITF net bc</font>

347
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,659
testing and i think is actually i think

348
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:37,468
05<font color="#E5E5E5"> i forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> update the number on the</font>

349
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:40,949
first slide but there there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one</font>

350
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:43,320
changes time um so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

351
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:45,839
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are basically two new test</font>

352
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,839
sets in the testing draft um I didn't

353
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,729
remove yes that's it's honestly a little

354
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:58,469
see me switching yeah I'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

355
00:28:50,729 --> 00:29:00,299
the slide I can read it on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera so</font>

356
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:02,549
there there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two new test sets on</font>

357
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:05,129
their objective<font color="#CCCCCC"> to slow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and objective</font>

358
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:07,889
too fast so previously we had the

359
00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:09,539
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> one ah and so these are</font>

360
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:12,988
basically just for these obsolete at old

361
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:15,419
tests am i renamed instead of calling it

362
00:29:12,989 --> 00:29:18,029
objective 1.1 i renamed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slow and</font>

363
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,919
fast just or less confusion which

364
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:22,159
reflects what they are they're basis of

365
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,349
just the same ways to previous test sets

366
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">where a slow has the very high</font>

367
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:33,769
resolution 4k videos and twice as many

368
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:33,769
videos total as fast as the next slide

369
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:39,959
um the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference with between</font>

370
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:41,998
these test sets and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous ones is</font>

371
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:45,119
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these new ones have HDR material</font>

372
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:47,190
arm in the test sets the HDR materials

373
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:51,779
at all resolutions all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> up from</font>

374
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:54,709
360 to 4k um it's encoded in HDR 10

375
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:58,109
compatible format which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a</font>

376
00:29:54,709 --> 00:30:01,829
su 2084 with the thousand at peak

377
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:03,779
brightness and they're stored a Timbit

378
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:05,609
sample depth um that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that these</font>

379
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,709
all these tests tests even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fest will</font>

380
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:09,989
now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 bit samples in them which</font>

381
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:12,289
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can only use these test</font>

382
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:14,339
sets if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your codec supports tended oh</font>

383
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:16,969
that it does the probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

384
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:16,969
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

385
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:28,860
so luckily the ones we're testing do so

386
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:31,080
next slide um so dollar difference is

387
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:36,030
that we've added<font color="#CCCCCC"> 240p content to both</font>

388
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:38,280
test sets arm so we basically didn't

389
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,480
have with people were concerned we'd

390
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,160
have enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> coverage of really low</font>

391
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,070
resolution for example very<font color="#E5E5E5"> low bitrate</font>

392
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:48,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">cellphone streaming for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube in</font>

393
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:52,168
similar use cases um so we added a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 240</font>

394
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:54,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">p clips we also because of these these</font>

395
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:56,640
were small resolutions being much much

396
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,178
faster than code than the fast big

397
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,280
resolutions we decided to extend them to

398
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">100 previously limited 60 frames to now</font>

399
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:09,270
120 frames in length which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also the</font>

400
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:13,169
iframe interval with the limitation on

401
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:14,879
the hook length is mostly a a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU</font>

402
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:18,270
optimization so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a whole</font>

403
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,770
lot of time to ion because the longest

404
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:23,280
video basically limits how long the test

405
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:25,379
takes so for the small videos we're not

406
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:30,780
limited by the time they take so we

407
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:35,760
increase the length under 20 frames next

408
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:39,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide um there's our small tamal</font>

409
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,360
provements shields<font color="#CCCCCC"> to had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gray for a</font>

410
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:45,480
minute um so that that bug has been

411
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,850
fixed on the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of it isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

412
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,870
Tessa um the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

413
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">other videos have been switched around</font>

414
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:54,449
so that objective<font color="#E5E5E5"> to slow as is a</font>

415
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,879
complete superset of objective too fast

416
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,919
meaning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it only adds video is too</font>

417
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">effective too fast previously with</font>

418
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,049
objective one there were some

419
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:07,320
differences between the videos like

420
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:11,668
objective one fast had some videos in

421
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,850
420 format and objective 11.1 the slow

422
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:17,730
one had videos in four<font color="#E5E5E5"> before format so</font>

423
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:19,560
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> format's it had matched and</font>

424
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,780
you can basically if you can run a

425
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,460
vector too fast and potentially run the

426
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,280
slow version just by running the missing

427
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:28,440
videos which is a convenient feature

428
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,570
it's not implemented in our compressor

429
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">tour any implementations yet but is</font>

430
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:39,510
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future um I</font>

431
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:42,150
list the end of my presentation so it's

432
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,070

444
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:31,179
to create a 16-9 resolution arm

445
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,649
basically the weird aspect ratios uh

446
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,840
what they what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have is different</font>

447
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:38,180
order effects for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because</font>

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">your video codec is limited to say 64 x</font>

64 blocks with different<font color="#CCCCCC"> aspects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ratios</font>

450
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,400
you'll end up with blocks outside of the

451
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,370
picture proportionally and you'll have

452
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,010
to do weird edge of that I you know

<font color="#CCCCCC">specialists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often encoder um that's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually mostly covered by all the</font>

455
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,150
different resolutions especially some of

456
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:01,970
the 240 clip sorta resolution where they

457
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,410
are partial block sizes so that effect

458
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,350
is harder comfortable just by having

459
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:09,260
different resolutions I don't believe

460
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:11,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are any other major aspect ratio</font>

461

dependent effects until unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

462
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:17,679
into extreme long or wide aspect ratios

463
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font>

464
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:30,098
Steve Otto just this<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be jumping</font>

465
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:32,800
ahead a little as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

466
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:34,720
working group last call i'm wondering if

467
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,720
it makes sense on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold</font>

468
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,428
off publication until we're getting

469
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:42,459
close to finalizing the credit

470
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:44,080
specification itself since you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might end</font>

471
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:48,030
up deciding you need to do more

472
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,949
expensive tests and we now envision I

473
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:52,899
yeah I do i do think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a concern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

474
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:58,859
like you know that this talking has been

475
00:34:52,899 --> 00:35:01,930
up you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know iteratively updated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um but I</font>

476
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:03,400
the dollar concerns I edit the test

477
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,109
document does have a spot for a very

478
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,930
expensive like moss score testing

479
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:10,569
however that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really been used so</font>

480
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,980
it's it's it's quite likely that there

481
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,330
may need to be adjustments made in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

482
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,920
part of the document when we actually

483
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:22,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">run one so that I would be a concern for</font>

484
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,849
you know finalizing it right now I don't

485
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:30,190
see any harm in leaving it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts</font>

486
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:32,440
that is a while longer so so that if

487
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:34,859
there's any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinions on if we</font>

488
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:40,420
progress the test document or if we just

489
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:44,680
let our main work with back uniform for

490
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:47,369
longer until the FedEx or what have any

491
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,368
other opinions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

492
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:57,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">vary from Mozilla arm I basically the</font>

493
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,410
same opinion I think it's fine to leave

494
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:07,049
it open don't see any real harm to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we</font>

495
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:09,540
also someone in the virtual queue hi

496
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:13,290
Reynold just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mozilla I think it's fine</font>

497
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:14,880
to keep it open as agree with tim i also

498
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:19,650
just one thing on the previous

499
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,210
discussion of the the sizes I'm just

500
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:26,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering whether it makes any sense to</font>

501
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:28,860
have at least a case where it's smaller

502
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:32,609
than where the total width of our total

503
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:35,310
height is smaller than one large male 64

504
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:38,400
x 64 macroblock the 240 case probably

505
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:40,200
does not cover that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

506
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,010
question to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> critic people I don't</font>

507
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is</font>

508
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,600
senator from Missoula so I think that's

509
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:55,710
a reasonable thing to use in regression

510
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,660
testing I'm not sure it's that useful in

511
00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:01,690
quality performance testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

512
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:12,759
reasonable I agree before so I thought

513
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:16,120
I'd mention it<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks okay so it seems</font>

514
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,000
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some support for leading the</font>

515
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,859
testing draft open and not not trying to

516
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,390
progress it now is is there anyone that

517
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,390
feels we should progress it now

518
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,440
I'm also fine with leaving to this draft

519
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:39,510
free right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> until we finalize the</font>

520
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:42,430
subjective testing bits the only

521
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,630
counter-argument I believe it get it if

522
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">you get it done that means it's not</font>

523
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,080
picking up you can get this document

524
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,250
this working group last<font color="#E5E5E5"> all is in</font>

525
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">distracting attention how there were</font>

526
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> balls and maybe you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have more</font>

527
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,700
cycles in to<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish them but I mean if</font>

528
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,470
you think that the process of finishing

529
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,689
the Codex is going to discover and then

530
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,549
the other counter-argument to be having

531
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,560
a moving target for what the products of

532
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:08,160
the art being tested as I evaluate them

533
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:11,890
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be harder go to developers but I</font>

534
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,420
mean so I mean I think there's there's

535
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,879
some benefit to getting it done and so

536
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:19,000
that is a that's one more document

537
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,520
that's not hanging fire and two it's a

538
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,630
fixed point for the product developers

539
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,630
to target target

540
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,460
sku young though there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

541
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,290
ground potentially right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

542
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,080
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a working people estaba can not</font>

543
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:37,820
submitted for publication right away

544
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,500
then you could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> open issues as they</font>

545
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,840
come along later but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still know that</font>

546
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:48,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something sexist on the test</font>

547
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:51,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you have already there if we intend</font>

to continually update it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thomas if</font>

549
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,370
that's your intent but you think there's

550
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:58,490
going to be some subset of changes

551
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:00,740
coming in over you know over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

552
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:03,100
several months then you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all so</font>

553
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:05,540
violently try to push it for publication

554
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:08,720
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other hand you're you're pretty</font>

555
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:11,000
sure that you know it's it's ninety-nine

556
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,520
percent done and that anything would

557
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,170
just be minor updates you know editorial

558
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,900
level updates are just adding a few more

559
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,060
test sets<font color="#E5E5E5"> any few more tests clips you</font>

560
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:23,090
know that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in material too</font>

561
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:25,190
that's one in how we publish it now or

562
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:28,250
later then out so we go ahead and do it

563
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:30,530
now like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really as editor what do</font>

564
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:33,710
you think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the likelihood of love</font>

565
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:38,060
dates here<font color="#CCCCCC"> subscene the violence so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

566
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:39,500
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have done um I have so far for</font>

567
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,630
each of the last meetings I think

568
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,660
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a fairly large update but</font>

569
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:46,940
mostly it's been bought awarding changes

570
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,549
but I I would actually consider the

571
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,800
addition of test clips a very large

572
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:53,570
update because I get directly changes

573
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:58,550
the results you get from the testing

574
00:39:53,570 --> 00:40:00,050
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i think i think that the</font>

575
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:02,180
larger most likely thing that happened

576
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,680
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there for a new ver new set of</font>

577
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:08,210
test clips to be added for some special

578
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:10,520
case the and then also the subjective

579
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:13,730
test the in section potentially changing

580
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,110
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you you know if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

581
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,420
don't consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding not you know</font>

582
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:21,500
testing clips to be a large change then

583
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,970
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could publish it but if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

584
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,790
don't want to go into working group us

585
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:27,790
called the potential for that then would

586
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:30,970
have probably make sense to hold off

587
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,980
I don't think want to publish stuff just

588
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,279
to publish stuff so it sounds like

589
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,690
there's really no strong opinion on<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

590
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,940
progressing it now no strong opinion

591
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,530
favoring progressing it now I heard a

592
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,080
pretty weak opinion from Jonathan the

593
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,270
self questioning whether or not you

594
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,069
really believe that so I think we'll

595
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,509
keep this document open and I don't

596
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:52,330
think about you to do a last call on it

597
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:55,750
is if we intended progressive later

598
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:58,660
anyway it just replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pork so</font>

599
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:01,480
probably will will progress the

600
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,339
requirements first and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will create a new</font>

601
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,810
milestone if we have to for the testing

602
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:09,610
got there they both want the nervous a

603
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:14,100
mouse tonight feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free to make your</font>

604
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,100
updates Thomas okay

605
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:19,310
anything else on testing

606
00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:37,190
all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so ok so the next</font>

607
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:51,589
item will have a Steiner give us an

608
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:55,190
update on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the floor codec I have two</font>

609
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:58,308
topics today I'll go through the changes

610
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:06,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">in forces last meeting it's not a long</font>

611
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:09,289
list yeah it's a better and I will go

612
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:12,099
through an update on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> performance I</font>

613
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:14,359
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new data using our request yet</font>

614
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:17,480
previously we have been using<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

615
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:20,239
internal cisco test so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

616
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,440
about time to make a switch to what we

617
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:29,839
have agreed on to use in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work</font>

618
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:32,960
moving on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the first slide the new</font>

619
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:35,808
things in info<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've added support for</font>

620
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,269
monochrome video which was a trivial

621
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:43,880
thing to add and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> added support for</font>

622
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:46,700
42 chroma sampling which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

623
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:50,269
rebuild head it's actually encoded them

624
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:52,189
as 444 internally which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

625
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:54,589
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple to implement them code</font>

626
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:58,249
remains clean and simple we don't have

627
00:42:54,589 --> 00:43:03,650
to be concerned about from the aspect

628
00:42:58,249 --> 00:43:07,189
ratio or rectangular blocks the downside

629
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:09,859
is that it likely gives us a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem of</font>

630
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:14,890
compression I don't know how much

631
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:14,890
because I didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the proper way</font>

632
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:22,119
[Music]

633
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:26,329
but I think perhaps 422 is a corner case

634
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:29,329
one use case is interlaced video which

635
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:31,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an analog eight years old compression</font>

636
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:33,950
technique and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> might belong to</font>

637
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:37,470
something better now I

638
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:42,029
perhaps so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sensors will</font>

639
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:46,439
give you four to two but again unless

640
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:49,260
somebody can come up with I really use

641
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:53,160
case for this I would be reluctant to

642
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:59,190
add a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complexity in the encoder</font>

643
00:43:53,160 --> 00:44:01,890
and decoder for a corner case so my

644
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:06,960
suggestion is to just keep it as I did

645
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:11,129
for now and I also made some changes to

646
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> C of F equals fellow past picture</font>

647
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:16,530
some improvements there which gave point

648
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:23,130
four per cents PDR gain in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the high</font>

649
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:25,410
complexity setting there's a question as

650
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:28,740
well sir thomas is there any 42 content

651
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:31,020
in the testing draft easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it is</font>

652
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">at least in the latest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

653
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:39,600
thomasville now let's talk Randall's

654
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:43,319
question first and we'll get Thomas

655
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:46,860
dancer sure mind on the same issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

656
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:49,320
note that currently we're weird C code

657
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:52,200
both in chrome and firefox is very

658
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:56,520
heavily 422 oriented in fact it's all

659
00:44:52,200 --> 00:45:02,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">four to two so just a note when you're</font>

660
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:05,160
in front 20 or 40 to 42 I believe now

661
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:09,900
that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably a 420 420</font>

662
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:13,589
may be here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when reporting stats for</font>

663
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:20,100
two hours probably yes for probably four

664
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:22,230
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case it's not for 44 and so the</font>

665
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:28,259
question is how suboptimal is a

666
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:30,450
compression um as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

667
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:34,860
because then I would have to implement

668
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:38,448
the proper bait yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Centurions or</font>

669
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:41,219
not jumping I'm sorry input

670
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:43,319
yep Tim territorial one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

671
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:44,549
test that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be to take another codec</font>

672
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:46,558
which does implement it the

673
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:48,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">quote-unquote proper way and see how</font>

674
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,239
much difference it makes there and it's

675
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:54,740
probably seen the same ballpark enjoy

676
00:45:50,239 --> 00:46:00,140
yeah I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that but</font>

677
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:03,410
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> give an indication i agree and</font>

678
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:08,210
a test set clumsy is a 4<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and 4 20</font>

679
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:10,609
there is no for 22 in the test set okay

680
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:13,580
so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think you</font>

681
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:17,840
should add um if we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support</font>

682
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:19,910
for two who yes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the the main use</font>

683
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,869
cases for 42 are generally legacy

684
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:30,609
broadcast applications which are not

685
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:35,090
nearly as rate-sensitive in general so

686
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:40,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">something we could add but i would</font>

687
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:43,400
actually me one remember go ahead yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

688
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">would actually be a pretty comfortable</font>

689
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that being you know heavy maybe</font>

690
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:51,169
that part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just regression testing or</font>

691
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,760
maybe one or two clips that are 42 just

692
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure it's not totally broken if</font>

693
00:46:52,760 --> 00:47:00,590
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support it but does anyone</font>

694
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:04,930
remember what their requirements s about

695
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:09,560
partition yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think tourism thank you</font>

696
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:13,549
to mention that<font color="#CCCCCC"> good is yeah can you</font>

697
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:15,350
hear me yeah okay yes exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I was</font>

698
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:20,210
going to say that in the requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

699
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:26,630
do have a mention of 422 requirement but

700
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:28,970
no I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely with Thomas that</font>

701
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:31,460
the reason that it's there is for legacy

702
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,959
broadcast applications so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

703
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:35,810
it's something that we need to support

704
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,220
but doesn't have to be optimally

705
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:41,420
supported i think that most of the

706
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:44,419
material<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be 420 in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for 44 in 42 as</font>

707
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:48,350
Thomas<font color="#E5E5E5"> says we should have you know one</font>

708
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:51,619
or two streams just to make sure that

709
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:53,569
nothing is broken but I'm I think we're

710
00:47:51,619 --> 00:48:01,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay with having itself optimally</font>

711
00:47:53,570 --> 00:48:02,360
supported<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok then I'll live on and they</font>

712
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:05,089
are

713
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,460
they are various fixes in for for

714
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:09,890
instance there was a bug in the

715
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:14,720
chromatin<font color="#E5E5E5"> luma code in the high big that</font>

716
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:19,640
case we have the fixes for increased

717
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:22,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Portability and also we have a code that</font>

718
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:25,490
has been taken from for and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

719
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:28,610
v1 codec and whenever that code has been

720
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:32,450
updated in<font color="#CCCCCC"> any one none and try to take</font>

721
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:38,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in before so i won't i would</font>

722
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:43,399
like to keep common code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sync</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

723
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:47,540
so i'll give some details on the change

724
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,220
in sea of the earth see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> f has been</font>

725
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:52,670
percentage I because I'm not going to

726
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:56,450
repeat that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but seals just reminding</font>

727
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:58,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that C of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> F is no future it will modify</font>

728
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:02,799
the pixels by a delta which is

729
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:05,690
calculated using the surrounding pixels

730
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:09,800
it used to be six pixels that has been

731
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:13,690
increased to eight pixels and also the

732
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:17,360
filter has click function which is

733
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:24,160
restricting the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of change that</font>

734
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:28,510
the pixel can change and that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

735
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:32,330
modified as well it used to be a pure

736
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:35,240
code function taking the difference on

737
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:37,310
strength of the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if the</font>

738
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:42,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference most larger than the strength</font>

739
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:47,150
will return the strength an improvement

740
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:48,740
of that is to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the function so</font>

741
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:53,030
that if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> large</font>

742
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:55,160
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to modify that</font>

743
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:57,890
version we will want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave the image</font>

744
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:01,549
and changed so that's what's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

745
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:05,900
like this on this side I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

746
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:08,000
illustrate the new function um it can

747
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:12,380
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three different strengths and</font>

748
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,040
that's what the plot shows are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

749
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,620
strengths can be either<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12</font>

750
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:22,860
or it's possible little bit hard to see

751
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:24,390
on the image here but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

752
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:32,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard resolution screen so perhaps</font>

753
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:38,670
you can see and so water has been added

754
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:42,150
is a ramp down dates so in this case in

755
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:46,770
this example if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is more</font>

756
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:49,590
than 32 we will not change the pixel and

757
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:53,960
if the values are between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength</font>

758
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:58,620
and and 32 it will ramp down gradually

759
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:03,630
and the function takes now takes another

760
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:07,310
argument which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the zero point that we</font>

761
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:09,810
have so but zero point will change

762
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:12,900
depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the quality so if the</font>

763
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:16,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">polity is high we want this deeper ramp</font>

764
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:19,680
down and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we are encoding chroma</font>

765
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:23,760
with rant on this deeper so this adds

766
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:25,919
some new complexity but it's still quite

767
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,500
simple to implement itself Cindy

768
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,560
friendly everything can be computed

769
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,480
using eight bits lanes meaning that if

770
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:37,860
you have a DX<font color="#E5E5E5"> two instructions that you</font>

771
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:44,430
can do duty<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on 32 pixels in</font>

772
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:48,390
parallel next time so moving on to the

773
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:51,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">next topic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have run some experiments</font>

774
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:56,190
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RV compressed schedule I I</font>

775
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:57,960
wanted to include x265 as well ah but

776
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:00,660
for some reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't get that your</font>

777
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:04,650
orchids you can get it working at some

778
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:09,000
later in the build so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I only have four</font>

779
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">compared to 81 and it's I think it's</font>

780
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,470
useful to have an update on this since

781
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:20,759
we have switched I have switched the

782
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:23,240
test sequences the old sets used to be

783
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,240
pretty

784
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:29,479
video conferencing centric so there's

785
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:32,009
now a much wider set of sequences

786
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:36,660
another difference is that I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

787
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:42,930
have clips with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 seconds of video now</font>

788
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:45,118
it's one second it means that it is it

789
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,618
shows much more than in track

790
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,479
performance and luxury that's very

791
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:54,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">useful but I guess magmatic reasons we</font>

792
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:59,249
decide to be short it's using the

793
00:52:54,839 --> 00:53:02,699
objective one set which Thomas said this

794
00:52:59,249 --> 00:53:06,269
is now updated I I try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the new</font>

795
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:08,039
one but it can now<font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four doesn't</font>

796
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:11,249
support resolutions that are not

797
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:13,769
multiple of 16 and I hadn't time to fix

798
00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:17,578
that so I had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the old that's set</font>

799
00:53:13,769 --> 00:53:20,008
and there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been quite a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

800
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:21,329
activity in maybe one recently so it

801
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:24,589
would be interesting to see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> far</font>

802
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:29,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">compares now and what I found was that</font>

803
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:33,890
81 now generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least on average</font>

804
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:33,890
becomes better than poor it used to be

805
00:53:33,979 --> 00:53:44,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhat worse that's compression but</font>

806
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:47,039
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> again it was something that was</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very close to be benign so anyone</font>

820
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:35,249
and the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for that is in usual</font>

821
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:36,390
in anyone under the palatal which helps

822

a lot for

823
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:42,779
some sequences and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did this</font>

824
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:45,180
testing I discovered that everyone seems

825
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:48,510
to have a three to four times B the

826
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:51,828
lunches or before in the air compressed

827
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:55,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">at service compared to what we have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

828
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:57,019
couldn't figure out why that was the

829
00:54:55,049 --> 00:55:00,930
reason whether that was because of

830
00:54:57,019 --> 00:55:04,470
compile options or different

831
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:06,089
architectures and and so on so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

832
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,069
probably focus on the compression and

833
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:10,859
I'm not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the speed in the</font>

834
00:55:08,069 --> 00:55:13,920
capacity that I did and you'll also see

835
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:17,549
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> resilience which is the only thing</font>

836
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:20,339
that's for support he has a significant

cost the<font color="#CCCCCC"> default mode I mean everyone is</font>

838
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:26,880
not to be errors in it meaning that if

839
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:28,769
you lose some data then you can't really

840
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">be called anything until you get an</font>

00:55:28,769 --> 00:55:36,899
intro update Charlie everyone is a

842
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:39,119
moving targets and as we speak new tools

843
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,579
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being added and in the queue next</font>

844
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:46,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">month's we'll probably see a ten percent</font>

845
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:51,390
improvement have seen more next slide so

846
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:54,450
this shows poor compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

847
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:57,058
and as before I have DD rate on the

848
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:59,308
x-axis and the frame rate on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> y-axis</font>

849
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:02,819
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should probably focus on the</font>

850
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:09,390
x-axis and for is to the right here and

851

either one is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left under its let</font>

852
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:17,549
it states the the better side so we see

853
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:21,329
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron silence on a day one is on</font>

854
00:56:17,549 --> 00:56:25,829
average about<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty five percent better</font>

855
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:31,349
in compression as i said i wanted to

856
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:34,289
have x265 here i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would expect x265 to be</font>

857
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:35,440
so much in the right about these lines

858
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:37,160
but

859
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,680
[Music]

860
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:43,379
unless at leasts unless x264 head

00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:51,540
and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want the next time we will see</font>

863
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:58,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happens if we want at least you</font>

864
00:56:51,540 --> 00:57:02,040
jump to what happens if we discard the

865
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:06,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">recipient requirements in that case a</font>

866
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:10,430
one is almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten percent better and if</font>

867
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:14,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">we move on to the hybrid a configuration</font>

868
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:18,899
then also everyone is almost ten percent

869
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:26,210
better and finally we switch off the

870
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:28,740
resilience next slide then everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

871
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:32,150
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like eleven or twelve percent</font>

872
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:35,040
better on average but I have to add that

873
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:41,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is a lot of difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

874
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:46,140
sequences so on this slide we see for

875
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:53,670
instance the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wikipedia sequence everyone</font>

876
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:56,910
is able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> slash the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bitrate by eighty</font>

877
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:59,550
percent complete before and I think

878
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:04,410
that's mainly because some people are

879
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:06,210
true but on the other hand sequences

880
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:08,850
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> kerline and also the video</font>

881
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">sequences which are the video</font>

882
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">conferencing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back door is performing</font>

883
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:21,780
very good this is by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way low</font>

884
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:23,420
complexity and and a high high delay and

885
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:27,440
for some reason

886
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:31,339
for the hospital loans or some chroma

887
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:34,640
and also on SC which is not the case in

888
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:39,170
lonely if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not because it's ten</font>

889
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:42,020
percent there<font color="#CCCCCC"> SM is also about ten</font>

890
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:48,530
percent so I need your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ops why this is</font>

891
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:50,359
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so my final slide um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

892
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:53,450
quick point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is since we're deciding to</font>

893
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:56,240
keep the testing graph to open it is a

894
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:58,308
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider you know other</font>

895
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:00,740
standards have broken out the screen

896
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:03,230
content or in general different classes

897
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:05,930
of content<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are expected to</font>

898
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:07,069
have wildly different results so maybe

899
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:10,009
it's worth in the test expect to

900
00:59:07,069 --> 00:59:12,799
consider breaking out screen content if

901
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:15,140
the results really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do skew things to</font>

902
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:17,420
make them almost incomparable maybe

903
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:19,160
that's worth considering for future

904
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,960
versions of interesting document on the

905
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,430
reports that we get from other contests

906
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,670
that there is a categorical screen

907
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:27,078
content at least 1080p screen content

908
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:29,990
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure which sequences that</font>

909
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:33,500
included probably include sub the

910
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:39,319
Wikipedia sequence I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sequence</font>

911
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:44,319
alone makes a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> global yeah</font>

912
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:50,259
that's that's with the biasing metrics

913
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:57,500
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is hansel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what next you don't</font>

914
00:59:50,260 --> 01:00:01,849
have a fixed BAM harm for is still using

915
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:05,180
the variable length and holding and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

916
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:08,240
think the expectation or animal and

917
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:11,839
codec is that it should have our if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

918
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:14,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">decoding so one possible solution to</font>

919
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:18,020
that is to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dollar and sugar</font>

920
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:20,660
colder and in that case perhaps is more

921
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:24,470
correct talk of emerged of four and

922
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:29,960
dollar since the entropy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Qadri's exactly</font>

01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:32,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very core of a codec I don't really</font>

924

925
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,859
I think

926
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,600
we will see info is pretty good but

927
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:41,340
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be taken</font>

928
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:46,799
seriously probably need something and

929
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:46,800
another thing that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be Donell is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

930
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:55,089
not see of death<font color="#CCCCCC"> abdallah the ring and</font>

931
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:58,000
that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dumb in everyone</font>

932
01:00:55,090 --> 01:01:00,970
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of that work is already done and</font>

933
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,100
again this will take the work in the

934
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:08,200
script<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work towards an inertial</font>

935
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:10,810
dollar I'm doing and since the visuals

936
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:17,799
have already been adopted in everyone so

937
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:20,529
on his part public take us close to the

938
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:22,450
sub settle everyone whore well actually

939
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:27,040
it might be more correct to say that

940
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:29,350
it's a bomb that has moved towards what

941
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:31,630
we domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> net diseases so much of the</font>

942
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:36,580
work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are done here has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

943
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:39,580
been adopted in anyone all the troops<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14</font>

944
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:42,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">already in 81 rv7 bit interpolation</font>

945
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:44,650
filters need sum of the coefficients

946
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,260
from those filters a man dressed work

947
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:51,750
based on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> will happen for I</font>

948
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:59,230
quantization matrices Delta Q everything

949
01:01:51,750 --> 01:02:02,440
is now adopted in very warm so that's

950
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:05,470
what I have it somebody has any opinions

951
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:08,800
on how we should progress with the code

952
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:15,299
at perkins speak up<font color="#CCCCCC"> does it make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

953
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:17,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have emerged to me I think it's</font>

954
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:22,920
probably a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea to see things</font>

955
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:22,920
convert in some way or another

956
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:33,590
yeah sanitaryware from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Missoula so I</font>

957
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:35,660
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my my patches to integrate</font>

960
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,210
changed quite a bit since then but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

961
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:48,410
don't that that was one year ago wasn't

962
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:51,140
it so i think we based in yes he's

963
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:52,790
either remind the workgroup that the

964
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,910
output of this is intended to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

965
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:57,529
single specification for the codec<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

966
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:59,950
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to progress multiple</font>

970
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:09,259
work so anything that can be done to

971
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:17,779
help merge things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a big</font>

972
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:19,550
benefit anything else oh by the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> john</font>

973
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:29,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">mark is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say a bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

975
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:45,470
right next up is your mark give a doll

976
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:48,500
update and see that filter yep so there

977
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:52,160
wasn't very much to do in terms of

978
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:55,430
update on della itself so what I'm going

979
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:58,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to present here is the constrained</font>

980
01:03:55,430 --> 01:04:02,450
directional and has been filters EF that

981
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Steiner was talking about next slide</font>

982
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:12,169
please so first so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steiner explained</font>

983
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:14,600
what CL PF was like so brief reminder of

984
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:18,110
what the direction the dolla directional

985
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:22,850
joining filter was it's a filter that

986
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:26,210
operates on a by eight blocks it works

987
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:27,620
first by estimating the direction the

988
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:31,760
main direction in each eight by eight

989
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:35,120
block this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is done only for luma then it</font>

990
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:38,670
uses a conditional replacement filter so

991
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:40,950
the filter is kind of similar to

992
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:43,770
the CLP<font color="#CCCCCC"> f function</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> except that there is</font>

993
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:49,620
no Graham down it goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero abruptly</font>

994
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:51,750
and that filter is first apply along the

995
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:55,109
direction that was found by the

996
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:58,770
direction estimation and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed</font>

997
01:04:55,110 --> 01:05:01,530
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second filter that filters across</font>

slightly higher not very much the

1042
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:35,040
setting that's where we get the best

1043
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:37,830
results mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because low latency is</font>

appears that also lower complexity

thirty percent of anyone the exact

1058

settings but that is not very hard to

1059
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:31,370
reduce on the decoder side the

1060
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,230
complexity increase is on the order of

1061
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:37,740
twelve percent but we're still working

1062
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:40,259
on more optimizations to do there we're

1063
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:43,858
expecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get more into the six to</font>

eight percent in terms of hardware line

1066

it has been reduced now down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to six</font>

1067
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:56,730
lines which was what the original

1068
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:58,500
uranium filter proposal was using and

1069
01:08:56,729 --> 01:08:59,910
for certain strategy right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we're</font>

1070
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:03,370
using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the whole</font>

1071
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:09,700
frame optimization but it's possible

1072
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:12,700
to simply select to pre-select some some

1073
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:16,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">strands to look at for a frame and just</font>

1074
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:18,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">only search that then this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how it was</font>

1075
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:21,100
implemented in dalla and that worked

1076
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:30,069
fairly well so it should also work with

1077
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:34,060
a CDF<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposal next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> light and so what we</font>

1078
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:37,059
have left to do mostly first we need a

1079
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:42,430
perceptual distortion metric right now c

1080
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:45,970
d e f has a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a tendency</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to blur to</font>

1081
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:47,500
blur details in textured areas so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1082
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:50,260
need to have the better encoder

1083
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:54,670
decisions to use lower strength in these

1084
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:56,830
areas we have yet to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply entropy</font>

1085
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:59,500
coding to the strength so that should

1086
01:09:56,830 --> 01:10:04,000
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us reduce the signaling over head</font>

1087
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:06,030
slightly and last step is we probably to

1088
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,520
optimize interaction with other tools

1089
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:12,190
because if we're able to reduce ringing

1090
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:15,310
then you can configure other tools to

1091
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:17,769
get better quality by and allow more

1092
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:18,970
ringing which will then give you so

1093
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:25,930
there's still somewhere to do an

1094
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:29,500
integration there that's like and so

1095
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:35,140
here we have I think it should show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

1096
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:37,140
on the projector comparison of with the

1097
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:40,270
kind of during that can be applied here

1098
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:43,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is an example with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> load like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1103
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:20,320
that's it your questions so I'll just

1104
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:22,210
say it's a great to see emerge of some

1105
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:26,740
of the ideas I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the whole</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to have done here so I'm good to see</font>

1108
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the thorn dalla teams are working</font>

1109
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:36,460
together and getting some of the common

1110
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,250

1119
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:06,880

1120
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:09,460
advantage for this filter that if they

objectively when you're in time crunches

it allow the coda to take corners in

1125
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:23,290
other areas and hopefully achieve real

1126
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,580
time it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the main differences I</font>

about real-time encoding and you know

1131
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:38,020
some of the other video standards are

1132
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:40,120
much more focused on offline streaming

1133
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:42,580
so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> only care about decoding speed</font>
