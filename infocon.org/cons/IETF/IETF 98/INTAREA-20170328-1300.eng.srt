50
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:22,440
control protocol yes it's a hostage upon

51
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:25,210
I have a concern about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv Ted</font>

52
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:29,289
presentation i believe we give the wrong

53
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,229
message to the community accepting to to

54
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:37,330
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a visual presentation here on to</font>

55
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:38,530
summary we are not saturday<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

56
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,719
think it's fair to have the discussion

57
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,719
in the group and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

58
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,090
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presenter give the opportunity</font>

59
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,380
to give his views but definitely we will

60
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:53,380
talk about it at that agenda type yes

61
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:57,039
Krishna so Francis I think that's a very

62
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,510
fair point and the idea is like to give

63
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">him a shot of explaining what this is</font>

64
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,200
about because this has been like kind of

65
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,780
lingering around and like multiple

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,909
working groups and so multiple chairs

67
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,760
and interior bottom slot request for

68
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,680
this and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if</font>

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's anything there or not like from</font>

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,250
the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

71
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:21,970
but I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear them out</font>

72
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:24,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and by the way I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there might</font>

73
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:28,450
be someone online me if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> mute</font>

75
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,650
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some some feedback</font>

76
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:41,530
all right you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give the status of</font>

77

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so a status update a quick</font>

78
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,940
summary we have the current hostname

79
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,970

80
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,729
informational RFC congratulation and we

81
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,460
have the privacy consideration for IP

82
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:58,030
broadcast multicast we initiated a

capacity I'm representing the I Triple E

112
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,310
liaison that that we sent to I Jeff and

113
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,580
the interior working group as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result</font>

114
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:54,199
of us becoming aware of the request to

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this document draft nordmark</font>

interior I ppl a working group document

117
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:07,279
and in our review of this this

118
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:13,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> draft talks about i triple e</font>

119
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:16,379
8 0 to l 1 q bridges and the the way

120
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,080
that it talks about it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

121
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhat confusing um to us because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

122
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,960
guess there's two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could</font>

123
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,509
write the standard you could write it as

124
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,270
a profile that's more you know focused

125
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:29,520
towards how an operator how a customer

126
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,139
would would deploy it or you could I

127
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,630
mean I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> write it as a standard</font>

128
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,149
which would be you know mandatory

129
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,370
language on how an implementation of a

130
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:42,059
80 to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one queue bridge would be</font>

131
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,310
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> built and and the the way that</font>

132
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,329
it's written right now it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be easily</font>

133
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:51,000
confused<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is trying to be a</font>

134
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:54,959
standard that as normative constraints

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,699
on implementing dot1q bridges and we

136
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,739
don't think that's appropriate for IETF

137
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:00,859
to do

138
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,930
however we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is still a</font>

139
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:07,430
still a valuable document because what

140
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:12,890
it describes is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> frontcourt unquote</font>

141

private VLAN configuration of 802<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 1q</font>

142
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:20,780
bridges and and we've described that

143
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:23,180
within within our dot1q standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

144
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:26,360
we called it generically asymmetric

145
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:30,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">VLANs and and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this private VLAN</font>

146
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:33,080
concept that's described<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the draft is</font>

147
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,300
effectively an implementation of

148
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,580
asymmetric<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs plus our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routed</font>

149
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,030
multi-point connectivity and and we've

150
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:44,720
we've got some description of how that

151
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:47,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">configuration is is organized and sort</font>

152
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:53,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the appendix to this to this liaison</font>

153
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:55,670
we have we have an annex within the 802

154
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:58,819
dot1q standard that describes<font color="#CCCCCC"> asymmetric</font>

155
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">vlans and and how it could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be configured</font>

156
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,860
to support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think and our view</font>

157
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,219
is that this draft is a further

158
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:13,460
clarification of such such configuration

159
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:17,720
and so what what our proposal is is that

160
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,970
if this group supports this as a working

161
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,390
group document and progresses it while

162
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,790
we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if ya what we would</font>

163
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest is that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tone of the</font>

164
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:33,890
draft be changed somewhat to focus more

165
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,920
on how routers can take advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

166
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:41,230

the section<font color="#CCCCCC"> that talks about 80 to dot1q</font>

169
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:53,870
should actually reference 802 dot1q in a

170
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:57,230
normative fashion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe I guess</font>

171
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:00,950
how it works without you know conformant

172
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,710
language on 802 dot1q bridges are built

173
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:08,000
in such a way so so that's the the

<font color="#E5E5E5">high-level ask of Ann Arbor reaction to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">12 of 802 dot1q and we have some details</font>

here on<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the private viewing how we</font>

182
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:34,239
think the private VLAN concept could be

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:38,540
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> with direct references to</font>

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:42,230
the 802 dot1q standard and we offer that

185
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:45,849
for your consideration so thank you very

186
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:50,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">much we have a question from resume yeah</font>

187
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:52,850
I think so having just refresh my memory

188
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this particular drafted it seems to</font>

189
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">me that there it there really shouldn't</font>

190
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,079
be any conflict in the sense that the it

191
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,130
should be clarified that this

192
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">recommendations in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft are simply</font>

193
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:08,990
about how I p FP before and ipv6 should

194
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:12,589
be made to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know on this type</font>

195
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:15,380
of network and that seems to me that

196
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:18,940
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the ITF should define yes</font>

197
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,620
yeah I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I so where it says here I'm</font>

198
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,120
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that this must and</font>

199
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,950
should there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just we just you know</font>

200
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,570
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it I think it it's fine to keep</font>

201
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,610
those Muslim there as long as it's as

202
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,160
long as they can be in no way construed

203
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,050
on on to mean what the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to should</font>

204
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">be doing right one so that's the problem</font>

205
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,829
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had with the draft in our</font>

206
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:40,579
reading of it with with our particular

207
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:43,430
rose-colored glasses we viewed it as as

208
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,350
constraints on layer 2 80 2 del one cube

209
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,170
bridges<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barrowman so with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an i guess an</font>

210
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,940
IP with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF rose-colored glasses you</font>

211
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,979
would have the other so what we're

212
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for is his language to make it</font>

213
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,470
clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it what you intended so yes I</font>

214
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:59,660
Eric on my toes so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very</font>

215
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you guys have spent time on</font>

216
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,189
figuring out what the actual description

217
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,320
on the mapping is and and there are two

218
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,240
must or must not in the section that

219
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,460
talks about bridges right soon but those

220
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,650
were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that is the main issue</font>

221
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,390
here and then but I think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

222
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">very useful if he can take the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font>

223
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's in this liaison and actually</font>

224
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,680
include that in the document because

225
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,110
part of the challenge here which is part

226
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,160
of my talent was the mapping from what

227
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:29,300
industry use

228
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:32,269
is in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> P VLAN terminology to the</font>

229
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:35,329
appendix in the 802 at one<font color="#E5E5E5"> qs back that</font>

230
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:37,519
talks about some of the things not using

231
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:40,219
any similar terminology right and then

232
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,319
the actual classes in the normally part

233
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:45,100
of this back right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about</font>

234
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:47,779
the mechanisms so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can have that</font>

235
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,689
include this dog<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't know as I</font>

236
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:52,430
asked on the list right in yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

237
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:54,920
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah no I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that was our</font>

238
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,689
intent in providing this text is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

239
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's for your if you think this is</font>

240
00:13:56,689 --> 00:14:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your draft you can use it and</font>

241
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,099
then the other minor question is yes as

242
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,779
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that who do we acknowledge is</font>

243
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,790
having contributed a stuff is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

244
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,910
committee is it also individual this

245
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,439
this liaison this entire text was

246
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,379
approved by the committee so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

247
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:17,269
default would be this is the committee's

248
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:20,180
view but there were several people who

249
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:22,910
were key in contributing to that and one

250
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,250
is coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the mic right now yeah the</font>

251
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,779
intent of the document was perfectly

252
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:32,930
clear and we have your name please

253
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:34,310
Norman in what way we were it was

254
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:39,699
obvious what the intent of the document

255
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:42,739
was and if you put on the right

256
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:50,899
rose-colored glasses<font color="#E5E5E5"> Glenn said if you</font>

257
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:55,389
can scan down a little move down scroll

258
00:14:50,899 --> 00:15:00,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">down and escrow on the lido there we go</font>

259
00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:02,269
if it's useful to you and it may be we

260
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:06,079
have been sort of as an appendix to the

261
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:08,990
liaison the details of how you configure

262
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,120
a bridge to do exactly what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it</font>

263
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,160
to do and we thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be helpful</font>

264
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,829
either you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your appendix or</font>

265
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:20,000
whatever if you find that helpful feel

266
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:25,479
free to use it steep attic and I put

267
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> together so if you use that stuff</font>

268
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:32,899
we'd be the right guys to reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

269
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,319
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>

270
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,939
I you asked as individuals there's

271
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:41,389
committee i think as individuals because

272
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:43,459
we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in there but but oh yeah so</font>

273
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,110
whatever so<font color="#CCCCCC"> norm wants to be reference</font>

274
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:47,449
individual that's fine but just just

275
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,639
that just that last part with the

276
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:52,069
details idiot you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah but I</font>

277
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's still worthwhile to reference</font>

278
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:58,540
the v8 or should I want committee since

279
00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:01,639
we sent from the exam so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

280
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,498
thank you thanks a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot Glenn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

281
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:05,869
everyone else so<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely there's</font>

282
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:08,319
interest then there's a relevance of

283
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:11,509
this draft so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we are going to</font>

284
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,339
first of all adopt it and then we

285
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:15,769
encourage of course the author to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

286
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:18,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">into consideration of this fruitful</font>

00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:27,459
progressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document taking this</font>

289
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:27,459
feedback into account so next this wrong

290
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:34,879
hello Ron<font color="#CCCCCC"> bonica and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here to talk</font>

291
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:41,089
about extended<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping and we can go on to</font>

292
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:43,790
the first slide okay we'll start by

293
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:45,319
talking about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> old friend eng um</font>

294
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is a lightweight tool that we use</font>

295
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,099
to probe the liveness of a remote

296
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:52,670
interface it's nice and<font color="#CCCCCC"> lightweight</font>

297
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,309
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credentials no logging in</font>

298
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,579
anything like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that relies on ICMP echo</font>

299
00:16:55,309 --> 00:17:01,490
and echo reply and it doesn't actually

300
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:04,250
exercise the interface whose status

301
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're probing the echo can come in a</font>

302
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,069
different interface the reply<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go out</font>

303
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:13,010
a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface um and it requires</font>

304
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:15,709
reach ability between the probing node

305
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,599
and the probe to interface that's

306
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,980
important requires reach ability between

307
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,089
the probing node and the probed

308
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:26,529
interface and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> words of notable</font>

309
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:28,850
sad so let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the next slide</font>

310
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:32,330
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about your new</font>

311
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:34,879
friend extended ping extended pain

312
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,830
doesn't require reach ability between

313
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,159
the probing node and the probed

314
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:43,250
interface however it does require reach

315
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:45,380
ability between the probing node and any

316
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,290
interface that is local to the probed

317
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,750
interface so

318
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,870
exactly to mean we mean by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that let's</font>

319
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:56,160
say I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a node i'm i'm looking at a</font>

320
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:58,020
router that has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> loopback but I can</font>

321
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,730
reach and a bunch of other interfaces

322
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,900
that I cannot reach with ping I cannot

323
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,550
probe the status of those other

324
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,850
interfaces the interfaces other than the

325
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,070
light loop back with ex pang I can probe

326
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,169
the status of any interface on that box

327
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:17,909
even though I can only reach the<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop</font>

328
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:20,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">back so X painting is is applicable in</font>

329
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,200
situations where the probing node has a

330
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:28,670
route to one interface but not

331
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:31,440
necessarily the probed interface um and

332
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:35,070
in all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenarios where X ping</font>

333
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,970
is applicable the probed interface is

334
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:40,800
not local to the probing node if it were

335
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:45,500
no local the local node would have a

336
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:48,570
direct route next slide so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

337
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,550
scenarios in which X paying is really

338
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:54,240
helpful well let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

339
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:58,980
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 um the node that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X ping is</font>

340
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">running on supports v4 um a router</font>

341
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,550
loopback interface is numbered from a

342
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:07,080
global p for global space but all of the

343
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,360
other interfaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> A through Z are</font>

344
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,300
unnumbered you want to probe the inner

345
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,129
fit of the status of interface a well

346
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,500
can't do that with thing you can do it

347
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:19,170
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pain let's take a look at</font>

348
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,470
scenario two is very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probing</font>

349
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:25,560
node is v6 aware of the router that

350
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:28,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're probing has a global global v6</font>

351
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:31,440
address on the loop back but interfaces

352
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,050
A through Z only have linked locals you

353
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,920
want to probe a through z you can't do

354
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:41,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">it with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you can do it with XP you</font>

355
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:44,180
think oh yeah it's true if it's a ula<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

356
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,640
just used link-local as an example and

357
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:50,760
now on to the next slide the third

358
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:55,080
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> X paying is dual stack it</font>

359
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:58,290
supports before or v6 arm all router

360
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,189
interfaces are numbered with I can't

361
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:04,090
read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> slides Seaver v4 or v6</font>

362
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:06,879
doesn't matter but only<font color="#CCCCCC"> the loopback</font>

363
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,668
address is advertised<font color="#E5E5E5"> into any routing</font>

364
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:11,620
protocols so the probing node doesn't

365
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:13,690
have a route to the probed interfaces

366
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,479
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does have a route to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> loop</font>

367
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:20,740
back in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> X thing works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

368
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,379
does not so next slide how exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

369
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">X thing work well we have two new ICMP</font>

370
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:29,289
messages and extended echo and an

371
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:32,110
extended echo reply<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm they both</font>

372
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:34,299
distinguish between the destination

373
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:37,629
address the address to which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send</font>

374
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,918
the ICMP message and well the

375
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:42,070
destination interface in the probed

376
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:44,740
interface you send the ICMP message to

377
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:47,379
the destination interface and the ICMP

378
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,799
message includes an identifier of the

379
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:53,370
probed interface and all of these ICMP

380
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,980
messages are defined for ipv4 and ipv6

381
00:20:53,370 --> 00:21:01,600
next slide so let's talk a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

382
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:04,870
about the echo request message on its

383
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,408
embedded in it and I IP header are the

384
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:11,080
source address is source from which the

385
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:13,960
message is sent the destination address

386
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the IP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> header is the destination</font>

387
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,159
interface on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the node that you are</font>

388
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,580
sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> request to it's the one that</font>

389
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,429
you must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach in the ICMP</font>

390
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,000
message there's a new type to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined</font>

391
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:30,340
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> iono</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the code checks on a checksum</font>

392
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,159
identifier sequence number they're all

393
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,590
the same as the ICMP echo request what's

394
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">different is you have an ICMP extensive</font>

395
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,809
extension structure that identifies the

396
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,340
probed interface so you're sending the

397
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:45,158
ICMP message to the destination

398
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:47,590
interface and that extension structure

399
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:54,730
tells you which interface the probed

400
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:57,428
interfaces next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the extension</font>

401
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,429
structure contains one or more interface

402
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:03,519
identifier objects and each I'd

403
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:06,360
interface identifier object and identify

404
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:13,960
the probed interface by index name or

405
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:16,029
address um when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inner fire</font>

406
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,730
interface identifier identifies the

407
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:20,679
probed interface by address it doesn't

408
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,919
need to be the same address<font color="#E5E5E5"> family as</font>

409
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:27,190
the destination address so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say for</font>

410
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,549
a minute that you're sending an ICMP be

411
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:34,720
for a before message the destination

412
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:37,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">interface is an ipv4 address the probed</font>

413
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,029
interface might be identified by ipv6

414
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:42,370
address or it might be identified by its

415
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:45,640
MAC address it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily have</font>

416
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,590
to be identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> by an ipv4 address this</font>

417
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,059
gives rise to a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of new use</font>

418
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:54,428
cases in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases a single interface</font>

419
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:57,370
identifier is enough to<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify the</font>

420
00:22:54,429 --> 00:23:01,120
probed interface in some corner cases

421
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:04,389
you need to for instance let's say the

422
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,539
probed interface is identified by link

423
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:09,100
local address well two interfaces on a

424
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:10,570
single box might have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same link</font>

425
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,219
local address so you might need to

426
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:19,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">interface identifier objects next slide</font>

427
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:21,850
um the reply message should give you

428
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,350
exactly two pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information the</font>

429
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,678
operational status of the probed

430
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:29,080
interface and um what protocols are

<font color="#E5E5E5">people thought might be cool to throw in</font>

438
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,090
this we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to for security</font>

439
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:53,890
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> also because we don't want to go</font>

440
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:56,889
into competition with SNMP or any other

441
00:23:53,890 --> 00:24:02,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">management protocol this is just a ping</font>

442
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:04,029
look alike next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is a</font>

443
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,418
view of we<font color="#E5E5E5"> prototype this and this is</font>

444
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:09,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">what a view of X ping looks like um you</font>

445
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:11,620
know you explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you give it</font>

446
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:14,889
the destination interface and the probed

447
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,539
interface and it sends back yes I did

448
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a response from a probed interface</font>

449
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:22,139
these are the two protocols that are

450
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:24,940
active in this case we're probing by

451
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:27,279
whoops oh yes we are we're probing by

452
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,000
interface name we're probing we're

453
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,330
sending a packet

454
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 10 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 and asking about the status</font>

455
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:39,659
of GE 0 0 0 which may or not may or may

456
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:44,320
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the same interface as 10 10 10 2</font>

457
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:46,780
next slide here we probed by a

458
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,149
link-local address we're sending the

459
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,670
packet to 10 10 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 which in this case</font>

460
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:54,220
was a link-local and we're asking about

461
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,830
another interface whose<font color="#E5E5E5"> link local</font>

462
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:01,720
address was at the ground read it but

463
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so there are</font>

464
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,520
some security considerations here if we

465
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,590
were only probing by address things

466
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,700
would be fine but there's also this

467
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:16,149
ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> probe by name so you could</font>

468
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:18,940
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> expain to discover the names of</font>

469
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,280
interfaces on a box but once you know

470
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,810
the names of interfaces on a box you

471
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,320
know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what the vendor is</font>

472
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:30,780
maybe what version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cody's running um</font>

473
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:36,129
yes it can't go back one slide shirt<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

474
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:40,020
so I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pretty other than hi I'm</font>

475
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:44,260
Bob ended sorry if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that correctly</font>

476
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:46,870
when you probe FB ad Cohen Cohen one

477
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,810
there may be multiple interfaces that

478
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:52,629
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that link local address yes in this</font>

479
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:54,970
case on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one particular router there</font>

480
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,130
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one and you got an answer if</font>

481
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,260
there had been to you would have gotten

482
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:03,760
an error message back saying I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font>

483
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:06,970
there are two to such interfaces on this

484
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,940
box please give me some more information

485
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">so i know which one you're talking about</font>

486
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:15,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay or you could give i guess you could</font>

487
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:19,630
return for all I'm sorry you could

488
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:20,560
provide feedback on both or multi<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

489
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,270
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that but there were</font>

490
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,520
security considerations you might use it

491
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:26,740
to discover stuff so we got we got

492
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,110
paranoid and some please I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

493
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:36,460
you're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> way over the line here</font>

494
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:38,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay anyhow going to the next slide okay</font>

495
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,240
so if you're probing by name you can

496
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,620
discover names and then you can discover

497
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,010
other stuff

498
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,600
since if you see the name is FB 0 0 0

499
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,309
you know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Juniper you know that</font>

500
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,370
it's fast ethernet so it's either 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

501
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:53,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">100 megabits you probably know the MTU</font>

502
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,360
and you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discover that sort</font>

503
00:26:53,559 --> 00:27:00,250
of stuff so we need some mitigations

504
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:02,979
next slide by default routers disable

505
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:06,100
the ICMP extended echo message you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

506
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:09,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to enable it on purpose if you enable it</font>

507
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:12,820
you enable queries by type maybe only

508
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:14,649
support queries by address maybe you

509
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,139
only support them by name maybe you only

510
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:19,000
support them by<font color="#CCCCCC"> ifm decks but you decide</font>

511
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,790
which ones you support and that's a

512
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,190
manual operation it's not by default all

513
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not manual but it's a configured</font>

514
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:30,400
operation then let's say you've decided

515
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:33,250
yes I will accept queries by address

516
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">only the next thing you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> configure is</font>

517
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:39,010
I will only accept queries by address

518
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,140
and then only if the source address of

519
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,360
the query is from these particular

520
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:48,400
prefixes so you won't accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from</font>

521
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:50,469
everyone on the planet anyhow next the

522
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,890
status of we've a cup we've addressed

523
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,050
many comments thanks to jonathan<font color="#CCCCCC"> ludi we</font>

524
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:58,530
have a complete prototype thanks to

525
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:01,059
Reggie Thomas we have two new co-authors

526
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chen Ling cova and chris leonard who i</font>

527
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:08,080
think are both here freeze your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands</font>

528
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:10,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">stay high and um that brings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to our</font>

529
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,270
next steps well this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a dull</font>

530
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:15,909
draft um what would like to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

531
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:18,790
little vigorous compassion debate uh

532
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,860
marked by you know a little polarization

533
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,450
and name-calling and gratuitous<font color="#E5E5E5"> scandal</font>

534
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,580
keep it interesting no just kidding guys

535
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:29,110
um and then would like a call for

536
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:30,399
adoption<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have by hopefully a non</font>

537
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,959
scandalous question if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go back a</font>

538
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,520
couple slides to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

539
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,610
scandal sure well we can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

540
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,920
v4 and v6 active does this heaven read

541
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:40,928
the draft does it define which would

542
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,090
sorry sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eric</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Osborne level three</font>

543
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:45,190
does the draft talk about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> active</font>

544
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,050
actually means because I could see

545
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">different response codes from different</font>

546
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:51,460
vendors where sometimes active means

547
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:54,330
configured and sometimes it's up and

548
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes it's hell operationally up</font>

549
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,740
visit to find what that means hmm we

550
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:00,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">should probably be a little more careful</font>

551
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,519
about that we should probably steal the

552
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:07,049
definition from maybe um noob<font color="#CCCCCC"> to oh yeah</font>

553
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,490
everyone who ships this means the same

554
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,320
thing next<font color="#CCCCCC"> version I think this is a</font>

555
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,870
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool tool thank you that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

556
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">bicker and I'll look in the I'll make</font>

557
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure to go to the minutes do i add that</font>

558
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:19,919
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i add that the next version thank ya</font>

559
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,990
suresh krisshnan uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have one concern</font>

560
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,450
right so we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like heard</font>

561
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:26,159
ligado reports of icmpv6 messages

562
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,889
getting filtered everywhere like you in

563
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,139
like stuff like packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> two bigs getting</font>

564
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:32,699
filtered right what are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> odds of this</font>

565
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:35,010
like actually making it on the internet

566
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,539
with the new message code like a message

567
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,879
type right Leon I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

568
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:40,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure out how do you see the adoption</font>

569
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,130
of this happening and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second</font>

570
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:46,350
follow point for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll really like</font>

571
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">this run by some ops group like probably</font>

572
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,449
visa cops are like absurd or both like

573
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,450
just to get the operation feedback as

574
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:57,149
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok glad to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by v6 ops and</font>

575
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:00,990
maybe ops area working group as for

576
00:29:57,149 --> 00:30:02,428
being filtered the target of the target

577
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,980
of this the guy who<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing the</font>

578
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:06,510
filtering is the destination transit

579
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,010
devices shouldn't be filtering this at

580
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:13,260
all because they have nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose by</font>

581
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:15,539
passing it on and since by default it's

582
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,210
turned off the transit really shouldn't

583
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:20,669
now yes it might and if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

584
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,409
well we have a problem so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think like</font>

585
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:24,750
probably like a tighter applicability

586
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:29,399
statement for this might be useful like

587
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:31,289
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rat I couldn't find ok Eric drink</font>

588
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:34,289
and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it because it has</font>

589
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:37,260
for RAC 7404 when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> you in the link</font>

590
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:40,408
local address stuff now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder</font>

591
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:43,769
what if you explain a multicast address

592
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:46,019
was expected behavior ah we had some

593
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:48,539
back and forth about this in one version

594
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:51,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the draft multicast addresses were</font>

595
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:54,539
not allowed period then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided let's</font>

596
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:56,730
allow them exactly the way current ping

597
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:59,370
does and we will get exactly the same

598
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,480
behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good</font>

599
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,489
thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm open to a little</font>

600
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,799
impassioned debate and polarization

601
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,659
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah because you can reply</font>

602
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,020
for each and<font color="#CCCCCC"> every interface leveling</font>

603
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,700
member of this group right

604
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,550
let me pull you let me pull you

605
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,080
personally for an opinion which side do

606
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,310
you fall on we shouldn't allow it at all

607
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,389
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should let it happen the way</font>

608
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:21,669
thing does AC advantage of replying once

609
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:24,820
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> replaying a 1 square interface</font>

610
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:27,490
eating being a member of this group Matt

611
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,620
I feel cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decipher so you're not</font>

612
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:34,320
again you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not against reply on</font>

613
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:36,909
multicast group yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's wish it</font>

614
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,790
so Eric go to mark I was an interesting

615
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:41,650
thing does that mean I can use this to

616
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:44,260
think send a packet to all the routers

617
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:46,450
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can find out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who has this link</font>

618
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,090
local address because it has to match

619
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,140
that target right well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

620
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:55,030
interesting you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

621
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:57,220
destination address a morphic multicast

622
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,990
and the probe to dress a linked local<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

623
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,060
notice thought of that combination and

624
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,700
I'm now we will tell me where I want to

625
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well because some link local and</font>

626
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,690
I don't know where it is it's sitting

627
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:11,950
somewhere in the network but I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

628
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:13,240
reason I came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the mic was well so</font>

629
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,490
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is good news right</font>

630
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,770
because it opens up to the extensibility

631
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:21,850
mechanism to ICP echoes and so far we

632
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:23,440
only have it for four errors but this

633
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,360
also it means that you can put other

634
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,640
extensions in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the draft</font>

635
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,860
need to say something about those in

636
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,540
terms of filtering them by default you

637
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,879
know part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security thing right I</font>

638
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,190
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember what other extensions are</font>

639
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:40,000
defined but well there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

640
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:42,970
extensions that would be ignored by X

641
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,380
paying their other ICMP extension that's

642
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,970
for the text thing got them it would

643
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,270
look I'm nothing I don't care then

644
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:52,510
ignore them so okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is sort of</font>

645
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:58,150
a crime<font color="#CCCCCC"> it did a scenario for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both ipv4</font>

646
00:32:52,510 --> 00:33:00,580
and ipv6 that can bring each other's I'm

647
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:03,730
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that again who's a third</font>

648
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:09,280
scenario for ipv4 could bingung ipv6

649
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:13,280
scenario so

650
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:15,590
sorry there's that's amusing any

651
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:26,240
transitional solution or something like

652
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:28,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you need to get in the my</font>

653
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:36,110
climbing in the mythical tool if you

654
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:40,390
want to ask a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question ah you didn't get</font>

655
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:40,389
my question or should I say ask again

656
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:45,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get in the in the line you</font>

657
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,180
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to request the participation we</font>

658
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't see any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> participants speaking</font>

659
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:53,240
right now and it's just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question i</font>

660
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't see I don't see as third scenario</font>

661
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,810
because scenario number one for ipv4

662
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,950
only scenario number two for ipv6 only

663
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:04,669
what will happen when there are two

664
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:07,340
different versions using any

665
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:12,380
transitioning solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not quite</font>

666
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:17,090
sure I understand the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no</font>

667
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:18,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem okay thanks I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't wear the car</font>

668
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:21,440
there might be questioned but could the

669
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,600
target and the destination being

670
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,940
different at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this farmers absolutely in</font>

671
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:31,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact it's okay to send an ICMP 4v4 arm</font>

672
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:34,280
echo request and inside that it

673
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:37,669
identifies a probed interface by ipv6

674
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:44,090
address so it's perfectly legal in fact

675
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:45,889
it's one of the use cases we were

676
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,960
cutting the line because we're really

677
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:49,339
out of time sorry guys but we need to

678
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">keep moving because it's taking too long</font>

679
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:56,690
video but Ronnie's conquer for adoption

680
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:59,060
I yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> master call for it up so let me</font>

682
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:05,450
there's interesting questions but the

683
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:07,700
all those that would support adopting

00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,990
please first race of hands who has read

688

this raft

689
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:28,490
okay wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few 30 feet its so let's try</font>

690
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,530
to harm for four people that believed

691

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rat should be adopted in the</font>

cleaned up the normative language a must

in the sheds and such<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am asking here</font>

713
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:59,900
what the next steps are specifically

00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:11,500
related draft is cool extensions this

717
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:16,220
defines kind of the basic set of first

718
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:19,160
initial options for goop security check

719
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:21,470
some goo and things like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

720
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,859
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated this version recently</font>

721
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:26,209
add this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

722
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,910
getting this to be a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

723
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:33,050
vitamin int area but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would like to</font>

724
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:37,609
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that into the interior also next</font>

725
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:40,370
life and lastly I la this identifier

726
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:43,130
locator addressing I think I presented

727
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:46,009
this a couple times<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this group and</font>

728
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:49,310
various other groups so since so we

729
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:52,670
added Peter<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lenkov</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as an author from</font>

730
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:58,100
facebook the there is discussion about

731
00:37:52,670 --> 00:38:00,110
applicability ideas 5g IP work there is

732
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:03,020
one issue that was raised to that I

733
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we want to address basically we</font>

734
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:09,800
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a checksum neutral mapping as part</font>

735
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:12,980
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ila in order to retain checksum</font>

736
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,470
correctness after translation and we

737
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:18,500
also have some other bits defined in the

738
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:19,939
identifier and the question was do we

739
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,940
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at all can we just make</font>

740
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">64-bit identify our flat space and not</font>

741
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,640
have these bits and in the case of the

742
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,859
checksum neutral

743
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:31,879
I suppose we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would have to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that</font>

744
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:35,480
/ address domain it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> either on or off</font>

745
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,450
and not have any control bits so I think

746
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,549
what we probably do there is make the

747
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,890
address types which we have any

748
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:44,900
identifier identifier types and check

749
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:47,450
some bit maybe make that kind of

750
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,900
advisory and say that the identifier<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

751
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:54,609
can be a 64 bit flat space depending on

752
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:57,140
the deployment and our<font color="#E5E5E5"> request here</font>

753
00:38:54,609 --> 00:39:03,558
officially make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

754
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:05,900
adoption also thank you very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

755
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:07,700
so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already inherited one of the</font>

756
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:11,990
drafts here and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are companion</font>

757
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:15,649
drafts so well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it makes sense to</font>

758
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:18,589
to consider them all together but yeah

759
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:20,720
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need points Laurent I a lovely</font>

760
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:23,480
one one thing about ila that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

761
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,029
just really just realized recently is

762
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,779
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least in its basic</font>

763
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:32,869
format only essentially deals in 128 it

764
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:37,339
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> only can it provides mobility</font>

765
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:38,839
of individual IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you</font>

766
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:41,089
know while we're on the subject of

767
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:43,609
applicability we should say that that's

768
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:47,599
not recommended for assigning IP

769
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:49,700
addresses to general purpose hosts so if

770
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">we take on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> document we should have</font>

771
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:57,919
applicability statement to that effect

772
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:59,869
so we did define the primary use case of

773
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,589
the vile a that that is correct wasn't

774
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:06,109
intended to be for the general<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose</font>

775
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:08,359
case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are deploying it and data</font>

776
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:10,460
centers now but it is specific what

777
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:11,660
we're doing were actually did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even</font>

778
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,809
addressing hosts it's actually

779
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:18,348
addressing device or devices or<font color="#E5E5E5"> tasks so</font>

780
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:22,549
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of granularity</font>

781
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:25,250
there so we can clarify that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

782
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:27,980
suresh krisshnan the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 hat on one of</font>

783
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:30,349
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font>

784
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bit earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ali as well is</font>

785
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:34,069
that like how much follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> a book is</font>

786
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:35,689
there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right so is there like</font>

787
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:39,460
more work to be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> pilot and the</font>

788
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:42,140
answer is usually yes right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this</font>

789
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:43,970
works fine in the data center like where

790
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,240
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't there you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control but</font>

791
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:50,660
doing more stuff requires like other

792
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:52,069
stuff to be done and the interior<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

793
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,890
way it's shattered it's like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of for</font>

794
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:56,090
like one of work items<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm</font>

795
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,040
really looking for some guidance from

796
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,260
you like how much follow of what you see

797
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,730
because like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GU like it started off</font>

798
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,390
and then there's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a GU extensions</font>

799
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:06,710
right like so if it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one-off item</font>

800
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,120
it probably doesn't belong in interior

801
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,180
so that's like it just a logistical

802
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:13,040
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i read the graft and i don't</font>

803
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,629
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> like many issues with it but that's</font>

804
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this certainly missing</font>

805
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:19,280
functionality that to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work on</font>

806
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right and i don't have an</font>

807
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,130
answer yet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think you're</font>

808
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,870
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the call for this document</font>

809
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:26,150
but for gu x yeah go ahead with a call

810
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:28,009
whatever but fri la i think we probably

811
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,360
need to I'd rate a big and like there's

812
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">been like no discussion on this for like</font>

813
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:35,180
five months like I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> since October</font>

814
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:36,470
right like for this or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> my question</font>

815
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,810
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should have scripture we</font>

816
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,220
just adopted<font color="#E5E5E5"> more I I didn't hear you</font>

817
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:42,529
there there has been there's been

818
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,930
discussion and a lot of other contexts I

819
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:48,140
would point out that at both you and I

820
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:50,509
la our data path and that implies we

821
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,970
need the control plane so for instance

822
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:55,160
we just have the ideas lunch off and I

823
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,140
think that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great for the</font>

824
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,460
mapping subsystem but thats also

825
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,410
probably be in the routing area if i'm

826
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,780
not mistaken so there is there is a

827
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:05,839
larger plane of control plane that work

828
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:07,880
that has to be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the reason I</font>

829
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with taking on GU was like it's</font>

830
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,900
kind of like GRE like and like we did

831
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">GRE stuck here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right in interior because</font>

832
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,200
there's not a home for it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

833
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,480
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make the determination</font>

834
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,710
independently for ila than for goo goo

835
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,170
right like even though they're like all

836
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,980
kind of related like you say but i just

837
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,820
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the determination</font>

838
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:27,290
independent so I'm fine with like this

839
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,520
not a home for Iowa at this point right

840
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,410
so I would like you to still continue

841
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,820
discussing you start here but I just

842
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,279
want to have a better idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how</font>

843
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">much follow book is there to figure out</font>

844
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it's going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be here or should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

845
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:39,259
ball and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be a ball like</font>

846
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,310
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here or and routing so</font>

847
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,700
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the part I want to figure out</font>

848
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:48,110
before taking this up as well but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

849
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:49,669
talk about that I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that it</font>

850
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,750
would need it son working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group maybe</font>

851
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,060
that's what your question is

852
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:56,130
I don't I don't know how much more there

853
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,170
is so like i said i'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to restrict</font>

854
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:01,260
it to just be the data plane protocol

855
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:04,980
and then yes we need we need some

856
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:08,550
control plane but as Lorenzo pointed out

857
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,930
right now I la's primary first

858
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:13,620
application is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be in the data</font>

859
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:15,419
center which looks a whole lot like an

860
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,069
encapsulation in some sense so we need

861
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,400
that same sort of configuration same

862
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:23,520
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup running on the internet is</font>

863
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">very possible and it because it's</font>

864
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,200
transparent ipv6 it actually makes it

865
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,899
likely in some contexts so what what

866
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,220
should we put this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the list or yeah I</font>

867
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean I really think you should take this</font>

868
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,669
up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list okay what's up go ahead</font>

869
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,110
with the GUI extensions and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

870
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,510
take this up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for all of this</font>

871
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:41,310
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we'll go ahead do you</font>

872
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:45,420
want to get a feel from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the group ground</font>

873
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:47,130
right now or okay so please press the

874
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,110
raise your hands those that have read

875
00:43:47,130 --> 00:44:00,750
the GUI extensions this one that it's on

876
00:43:49,110 --> 00:44:02,250
the screen okay a handful okay well then

877
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:07,430
we'll call for<font color="#E5E5E5"> adoption on the on the</font>

878
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:07,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">business for business so next is</font>

879
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:20,040
okay so taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> out their chairs hat</font>

880
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:23,490
presenting here on behalf of my

881
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:26,490
co-authors hey Charlie Perkins myself

882
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:30,270
for Carlos<font color="#CCCCCC"> Moya</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dorothy and more so this</font>

883
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a draft that we worked a few ITF</font>

884
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:35,730
meetings ago then we discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

885
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:39,270
multicast over i triple e<font color="#E5E5E5"> 802 wireless</font>

886
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:41,460
the different issues and we got feedback

887
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:45,480
from from different sides so what we

888
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:49,410
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done now is taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole redo</font>

889
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:51,450
remake of the of the draft so first of

890
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,950
all the the draft right now has pretty

891
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,200
much the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same technical content but now</font>

892
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:57,569
it's structured in a way that allows us

893
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">to first of all describe what are the</font>

894
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,109
issues that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have observed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we use</font>

895
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:04,560
multi castle where I trip you later to

896
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:07,380
wireless media and and then we highlight

897
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,900
the features that are there to enhance

898
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">this multicast performance and these</font>

899
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:17,010
features can come from my trip related

900
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:19,439
to or<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF regardless we also have some</font>

901
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:21,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">texts that identify some operational</font>

902
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,690
choices that can be made<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allocate</font>

903
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,730
multicast issues and the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font>

904
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:29,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually provide recommendations about</font>

905
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:32,910
the the usage and combination of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

906
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:35,430
features<font color="#E5E5E5"> for operation of choices so</font>

907
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,290
first of all what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do is keep</font>

908
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:39,180
working with now this new structure and

909
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:42,450
identify other enhancements that we

910
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:45,060
might not have written yet especially we

911
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:48,750
have in mind things written in 80 to a

912
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:51,270
15-6<font color="#E5E5E5"> low etc where there if there are</font>

913
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:54,800
other multicast issue that we have not

914
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:57,060
captured we want to talk also about the

915
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,700
differences between implementations and

916
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:03,029
capabilities between different access

917
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:05,850
points because what we may observe in

918
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:08,369
the 802 11 access point at home is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

919
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:10,859
exactly what the behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we will</font>

920
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:12,869
see one of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise level access</font>

921
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:15,000
point so we want to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out and</font>

922
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:17,750
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to avoid making generic</font>

923
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,510
statements about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the behavior of 802 11</font>

924
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:24,450
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general and we also want to start</font>

925
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:26,369
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on recommendations so we are</font>

926
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,730
calling for feedback at this point in

927
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:31,810
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got already</font>

928
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:33,340
some from from Michaela burn some and

929
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:35,940
that's appreciate it so we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

930
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:37,930
into account for our next revision but

931
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:41,140
definitely what we want now is a

932
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:43,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">feedback come from you guys about more</font>

933
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:48,640
stuff to put in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft and eventually</font>

934
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:51,129
come up to good recommendations if there

935
00:46:48,640 --> 00:47:06,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">are no questions then we can move to</font>

936
00:46:51,130 --> 00:47:08,320
Carlos okay I'm kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of another's from</font>

937
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:11,290
University College remarried and I in

938
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,470
present in this work which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically</font>

939
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:16,859
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a community aware of</font>

940
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:20,200
implementation and a test bed for

941
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:22,779
validating and measuring multicast over

942
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,730
Wi-Fi extensions so this basically

943
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:26,500
related to what fun colors are just

944
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:32,020
presented could you click a little

945
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:33,609
novelty do it like this better so all

946
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,200
this this work has been carried out by

947
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:38,319
my colleague<font color="#E5E5E5"> pablo and i'm francesco</font>

948
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:41,950
from university of data so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

949
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:46,090
a first our view of what extensions of

950
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:48,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">date</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 11</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a a 2 in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of multicast so</font>

951
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically there for four mechanisms of</font>

952
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:53,230
four approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes a very quick</font>

953
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:56,530
reminder the legacy one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the way</font>

954
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">11 dot11 multicast it's transmitted is</font>

955
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:03,430
basically you transmit the frame using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

956
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:05,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">low multicam and CS and and you don't</font>

957
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,720
have any any proof or any any

958
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">acknowledgement that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the multicast ring</font>

959
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,919
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been received by by all the</font>

960
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,040
receivers and then there are three

961
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,530
different improvements one is basically

962
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,240
to transform this multi cosplay min to

963
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:22,060
unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> ass and you seem different copies</font>

964
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">one third intended receiver this of</font>

965
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:27,340
course very reliable but it has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

966
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:29,260
overhead then you have another approach

967
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,420
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically using the multicast</font>

968
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:34,770
address the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metric as packet sorry</font>

969
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:39,160
several times<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trying to improve the</font>

970
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:41,140
the rate of the success in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the receivers</font>

971
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,118
get in the packet and

972
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,430
then the last approach is what is called

973
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,849
bloke<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledgment will basically you</font>

974
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:51,098
send a block of packets and do then ask

975
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:52,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the receivers to say what I did</font>

976
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:53,740
receive or not and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you will</font>

977
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,559
transmit those that has not<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

978
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:59,769
received to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> procedures that didn't</font>

979
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:01,510
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packets so these are the forest</font>

980
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:02,979
tensions here is basically as a summary

981
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,660
of course you have a trade<font color="#CCCCCC"> of in terms</font>

982
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">of complexity and in terms of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Prayer</font>

983
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,098
variability<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more complex and more we</font>

984
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:13,869
heard you have the better in terms of

985
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:16,900
reliability and then having<font color="#CCCCCC"> this dis</font>

986
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:20,260
approaches basically technology defined

987
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:22,630
by idly we had a test wet in order to

988
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">first implement those extensions in</font>

989
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:27,700
Linux and then to validate and to assess

990
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:30,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the performance that we can obtain so we</font>

991
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:33,098
have this test bed with around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 notes</font>

992
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:36,129
all the test has been performed using

993
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:37,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel 14 to avoid some interference</font>

994
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:41,380
although we also did some tests in

995
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:44,619
channel 11 for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blog and management</font>

996
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:48,480
approach we explore different values of

997
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:51,099
m m is basically the size of the of the

998
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,359
the different the blocks of packets at

1001
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,960
different values of number of

1002
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,599
retransmissions so studio is just one

1003
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:07,359
single transmission the legacy mode want

1004
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:09,940
you to meet one for your attorneys for

1005
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:13,480
packets four times the packet and then

1006
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:15,519
for the MSC in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mcs choice for the legacy</font>

1007
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,680
with it set that to 24 megabit per

1008
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:22,930
second and for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different extensions</font>

1009
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:25,299
we use 54 married per second then we did

1010
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:27,910
a set of experiments the first one is

1011
00:50:25,299 --> 00:50:32,319
basically we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a multicast CBR</font>

1012
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:33,670
traffic over<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 we have 10 receivers</font>

1013
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,259
of that multicast traffic and

1014
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:39,400
additionally in the network we have

1015
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:42,789
lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 station stands between a dense</font>

1016
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:45,400
regular unicast data and then under this

1017
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:47,529
scenario we basically look into<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1018
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,420
performance figures one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

1019
00:50:47,529 --> 00:50:52,630
arrival rate so the multicast really

1020
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:55,089
rate and another one is the in addition

1021
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the aggregated data traffic that is that</font>

1022
00:50:55,089 --> 00:51:00,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">Taurus able to to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit in addition</font>

1023
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the multicast</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> track here we have</font>

1024
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,719
different results level is not actually

1025
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,519
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the results here and in the</font>

1026
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,619
interest of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just quickly go</font>

1027
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:11,169
through town but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically has to show</font>

1028
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:13,450
that for example when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the block</font>

1029
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:16,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">acknowledgement approach this is the one</font>

1030
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:18,960
that provides the best results in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font>

1031
00:51:16,269 --> 00:51:21,459
of ppl delivery rate as expected and

1032
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,519
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the in jello the</font>

1033
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:28,210
legacy approach and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> red the one about</font>

1034
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">anxiety said unsolicited retries with</font>

1035
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,869
our series should be basically the same

1036
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:33,910
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the yellow one but the</font>

1037
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:37,299
difference because of the MCS the

1038
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:39,819
difference MCS that is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used we</font>

1039
00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:42,549
have a result for<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel 11 we have</font>

1040
00:51:39,819 --> 00:51:45,759
also results for the the data traffic

1041
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:48,599
and we have also a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> set of</font>

1042
00:51:45,759 --> 00:51:52,329
spare amends using<font color="#E5E5E5"> real video with a</font>

1043
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:54,729
full HD<font color="#E5E5E5"> video with a very brave traffic</font>

1044
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:57,640
and there we also evaluated under

1045
00:51:54,729 --> 00:51:59,890
different scenarios so again here we

1046
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,940
have the results not a goal for this

1047
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:04,779
presentation to go into the actual

1048
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,089
results or the analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the results</font>

1049
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:09,279
but just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show the different things</font>

1050
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:14,589
that the test<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight allows to to be</font>

1051
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:16,719
proved so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that we</font>

1052
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:18,249
wanna just to make you aware there is an

1053
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,229
implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these are disciplined</font>

1058
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:33,519
into in traditional things and basically

1059
00:52:31,269 --> 00:52:36,008
what we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask here is for</font>

1060
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:38,680
feedback in terms of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

1061
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:40,029
test bed could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used for in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1062
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,489
assess for example the multicast

1063
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:45,519
tensions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> uncolored was mentioning</font>

1064
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:49,170
before there may be things that we could

1065
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:51,640
prove there and to in order to basically

1066
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:53,559
compare different approaches that could

1067
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,499
be used for multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> over over Wi-Fi</font>

1068
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:58,660
and there are some pointers if you want

1069
00:52:56,499 --> 00:53:00,910
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more information of course you</font>

1070
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:02,799
can also contact<font color="#CCCCCC"> me directly on my</font>

1071
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:06,538
colleagues you wanna order<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

1072
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:06,538
of questions or comments

1073
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:12,600
I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question on on the previous</font>

1074
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:18,300
night before you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the ongoing</font>

1075
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:22,140
work is to to test some other multicast

1076
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,520
enhancement features or<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically there</font>

1077
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,379
are different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1078
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,350
addition to this we can use the test<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit</font>

1079
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,760
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example to show the issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that did</font>

1080
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:33,060
in the draft in the multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap we</font>

1081
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:36,600
can try to emulate the same scenarios

1082
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:39,090
ipv6 signaling for example and to say to

1083
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,650
see okay with the legacy this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1084
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:43,170
performance those are the issues then we

1085
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:46,050
try to put one of these tensions or

1086
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:47,910
others I guess these guys are open for

1087
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:51,450
implementing other stuff we consider

1088
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:54,870
useful so we we are open to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to basically</font>

1089
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:57,240
encounter is the test that isolated or

1090
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:58,799
it can be mixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the real traffic or</font>

1091
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,229
other type of traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

1092
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic that we can put this I mean you</font>

1093
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:05,940
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put any any kind of traffic there I</font>

1094
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:08,190
mean we can use synthetic traffic we can

1095
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:10,290
try to put real traffic regulations

1096
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:14,010
still a test bed that is actual isolated

1097
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:17,430
from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that is serving</font>

1098
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:19,260
the campus yeah buddy sunday<font color="#E5E5E5"> is isolated</font>

1099
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:21,299
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not used for regular internet</font>

1100
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:23,010
connectivity but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the</font>

1101
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,140
building so you know the day the

1102
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:28,440
interference<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the stuff talk to your</font>

1103
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:32,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">radio is called as idea is just the back</font>

1104
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,920
end that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually okay thanks for</font>

1105
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,149
easy transfer good yeah I I may have

1106
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,490
missed this and you may have said it

1107
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,980
already but you you did you or did you

1108
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:46,020
not test like AC performance numbers

1109
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:49,050
with data heavy multicast but um are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1110
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:51,180
have you been testing with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

1111
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:55,770
packets that are ipv6 control packets

1112
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know NS and ra i think that the this</font>

1113
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,940
these results are basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1114
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">video transmission so no small pockets</font>

1115
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,230
but actually these kind of requests are

1116
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,660
the ones that they are interested in

1117
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:08,880
like you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available they are all</font>

1118
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:13,529
open to try these kind of things with

1119
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,690
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> pockets and s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and R I don't this</font>

1120
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:18,390
is this basically what they want if you

1121
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,980
think we can contrive yeah because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1122
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the scaling characteristics</font>

1123
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,170
are very different

1124
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:24,360
here you can like you can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1125
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,950
optimization by like gagra gating the

1126
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,200
packets into one big blob and maybe

1127
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:30,480
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> fewer TX ups or whatever but the</font>

1128
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,759
but the sort of control traffic is

1129
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,200
probably more spiky and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the</font>

1130
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,670
packets are really really small so it

1131
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,640
might become inefficient because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1132
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:40,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're if you can aggregate them into</font>

1133
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,890
bigger packets and it's expensive iron

1134
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:46,380
yeah I follow me so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the</font>

1135
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:48,480
whole point is just to have a framework

1136
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:58,910
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess that in our real</font>

1137
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:58,910
environment thank you

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so remember to present you a work</font>

1140
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:34,500
we have done with bazi Tommy père David

1141
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:39,210
and myself Eric<font color="#E5E5E5"> binky and the last one</font>

1142
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:41,130
is during my last name so quickly what

1143
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:43,980
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we trying to solve what you are</font>

1144
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:46,349
trying to solve is basically going back

1145
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:49,349
to the basic there are multiple v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> races</font>

1146
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:50,970
/ oath you can have the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> locale the</font>

1147
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:54,240
global unity<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pro global we all know this</font>

1148
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:56,700
right so what happen in a network like

1149
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,729
this one typical multihoming for small

1150
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:02,160
and medium business<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get to egress</font>

1151
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:06,150
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and you receive one</font>

1152
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:08,819
prefix red one prefix blue so on the top

1153
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:11,430
the pc select the source address blue

1154
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:14,190
exit by the blue router everything is

1155
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">fine you get the story if you take the</font>

1156
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:20,310
same address<font color="#CCCCCC"> blue and exit by the red</font>

1157
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:23,460
router hopefully the red is<font color="#CCCCCC"> P is doing</font>

1158
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:25,230
vcp 38 and you drop the packets let's

1159
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,990
thanks god for the internet that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1160
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:31,079
pretty bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the user so how can we</font>

1161
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:33,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve this first they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

1162
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:35,910
enforcement telling a if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1163
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,819
prefix red please use the next up as

1164
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:40,790
being right that's lots of the problem

1165
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:42,990
if you have multiple layers of routers

1166
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:45,420
because you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> only select the first</font>

1167
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:47,399
one then after there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is only one before</font>

1168
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:51,150
12 normally so you see never the problem

1169
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:53,760
but it's not enough assume one of those

1170
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">link is linking like a VPN to your</font>

1171
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,790
company now you have two dns server one

1172
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:02,130
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company and one from the</font>

1173
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:05,940
internet and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> working for cisco</font>

1174
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:09,359
systems so if on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPN the resolver</font>

1175
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:12,569
that i received the VPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked double</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> W</font>

1176
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:15,839
in for inside the cisco.com<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will get</font>

1177
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:19,829
an answer if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask my ISP or the same</font>

1178
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:21,569
name I will get no answer so that's

1179
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:24,800
lower than the address and the routing

1180
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:29,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">there the only one problem and the other</font>

1181
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:33,050
issue of potentialities is that if you

1182
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:34,770
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kind of network services</font>

1183
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:37,590
sing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1184
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:39,570
instance quality of service now whether

1185
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:42,390
they are done by traffic engineering or

1186
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:45,030
you are doing by classification and and

1187
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:48,330
this we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got point for instance there</font>

1188
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:51,360
is different level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of services now you</font>

1189
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:55,230
can say based on the source address you

1190
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:59,040
have to prefix red and blue the red you

1191
00:58:55,230 --> 00:59:01,950
have no quality of service but you say

1192
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,350
the blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> we act we classify your packets</font>

1193
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:07,379
hop-by-hop kind of lad if serve God pong

1194
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:08,819
diffserv but at least on this one you

1195
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:11,430
cannot change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the address this with good</font>

1196
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:14,190
point we've seen this morning at Mataji

1197
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:16,730
can disappear at least your PVC address

1198
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:20,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source does not change on the path</font>

1199
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:23,130
so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways of using the prefixes</font>

1200
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:26,520
to select the service and that's

1201
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:30,990
basically what oops this kind of graph

1202
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:33,660
wants to say a mr. application yes you

1203
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:36,089
do have if the router<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertise</font>

1204
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:39,810
different services based on the source

1205
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">address you may select different kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1206
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:46,049
quality of service of quality of

1207
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:51,120
experience sounds logical but a we done

1208
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:54,270
this before yes sir yes all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

1209
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:56,040
whether its iOS or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android I've got</font>

1210
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:59,340
phones where you can select this

1211
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:01,680
application may use or may not use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> C</font>

1212
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:04,650
learning because it's expensive most of

1213
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,549
the time there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why and set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OS</font>

1214
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:10,320
vendors deeply do it so we have already

1215
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:12,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge that application by</font>

1216
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:15,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">application you can use till</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I yes or no</font>

1217
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:17,580
so they could do and extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a please</font>

1218
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,410
use this source address or dead<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

1219
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:23,420
address basically to select the network

1220
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:27,210
service so now i'll throw down

1221
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:30,540
traversing the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> dvds that's not a</font>

1222
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:32,640
new concept it came<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the milk</font>

1223
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:34,920
working group as well you get multiple

1224
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,690
interface on each interface multiple

1225
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,000
routers and Onision routers you can

1226
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:41,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertise multiple critics is so very</font>

1227
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,510
multiple perfect is you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> dvds are</font>

1228
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:47,910
the set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a PVD ID that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1229
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:48,180
glue all the set of information think

1230
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,790
about

1231
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:54,660
at the first level as an index into the

1232
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:57,240
database it links<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prefix of course</font>

1233
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:59,578
the next stop the dns information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1234
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,339
call you a can you look for inside the

1235
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:04,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">anus or the outside unit but also for</font>

1236
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:06,509
instance and there are other<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1237
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,750
conclude that may be<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested is there</font>

1238
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:11,040
a captive portal here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't start</font>

1239
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,650
the application in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exactly to go</font>

1240
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:16,440
there do I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

1241
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:18,569
globally or is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just a world garden</font>

1242
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,180
just look about the movies in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane</font>

1243
01:01:18,569 --> 01:01:23,400
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the train it's also important to know</font>

1244
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:27,328
right and you can also get is it free of

1245
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:29,630
charge on or three of charge all do we

1246
01:01:27,329 --> 01:01:33,839
communicate the set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and</font>

1247
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:39,119
we are in 2017 so it's a pv6 on a

1248
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:42,540
solution right so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sending what</font>

1249
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:45,329
you call to bootstrap<font color="#CCCCCC"> PVD into the</font>

1250
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:47,130
router advertisement it is important

1251
01:01:45,329 --> 01:01:49,740
there is no round trip time you don't

1252
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do more thing of probing of</font>

1253
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:55,770
fetching information in the bootstrap

1254
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:59,790
PVD you get enough we assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1255
01:01:55,770 --> 01:02:02,849
PVD applies to all prefix information

1256
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:05,190
option into the array if you want to

1257
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:07,680
advertise different PVD you will need

1258
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:10,049
different traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> ceased to be sent in</font>

1259
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:15,419
different Eric's from different link

1260
01:02:10,049 --> 01:02:17,940
local address eric is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wait</font>

1261
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:20,970
or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can wait okay so let me finish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1262
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:22,730
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we can also put into the array</font>

1263
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,660
or two could advance information

1264
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:28,140
condensed of course right you are

1265
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:30,868
limited to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1k little bit more of the</font>

1266
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,879
array and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> put another sentence like</font>

1267
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:35,369
this again that's a proposal by the way

1268
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's 0 dash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 00 so I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric if it's</font>

1269
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:39,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">only here three does a good time I think</font>

1270
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:42,629
you have to say instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of only applying</font>

1271
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:44,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PIOs I'm sorry Eric fine instead of</font>

1272
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying only applies to POS it has to</font>

1273
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:47,819
apply out to all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information in the</font>

1274
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:50,640
RA that's gathering to the re OS and the

1275
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:54,660
rdns and<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SL options you are</font>

1276
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:57,390
perfectly correct in this in the draft

1277
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:59,520
is really better explaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> this always</font>

1278
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:01,290
actually here thank you and thanks for

1279
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,050
the career duration

1280
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:07,620
yes Kristen so having seen this

1281
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:12,540
trainwreck many times right and I'm just

1282
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:14,040
wondering how<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how are things going</font>

1283
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:17,910
to go differently the sound sorry for

1284
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:19,650
being skeptical here right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh very</font>

1285
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:22,049
thing the differentiation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like</font>

1286
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:23,520
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you only hear it's like</font>

1287
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:27,180
smiling as well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone through this</font>

1288
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:28,560
like stuff ourselves right and so so

1289
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,089
either it's a question of like how much

1290
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you wanna cover for example already like</font>

1291
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:33,960
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> audion SS is there right so</font>

1292
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,339
there's gonna be other options coming in

1293
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,980
the future and they might need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1294
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:39,990
contained or not so and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1295
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,730
biggest issue that's sang like waters in

1296
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:44,250
there because like if you have a tightly

1297
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:46,740
scope small set of things it becomes

1298
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:48,750
doable if you want like a broader scope

1299
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,220
of things to go in there it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1300
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:52,830
difficult especially if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1301
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:54,720
what's gonna go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there right so yeah</font>

1302
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:57,029
mark<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want you something on that</font>

1303
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">pleasure okay so on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one the</font>

1304
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">mechanism here it's pretty simple</font>

1305
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:03,180
compared to other one that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are much</font>

1306
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:05,970
more complex and what we sent is the

1307
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:07,859
bare minimum right<font color="#E5E5E5"> PVD ID next slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1308
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:10,370
swing what we can do more but all the

1309
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:13,530
same time they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could their the string is</font>

1310
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:15,660
extensible messaging so do not need to

1311
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:17,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">define like tlv again in another draft</font>

1312
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:19,649
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea another tlv and so on and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1313
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:22,649
on and whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> you support it or not</font>

1314
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:25,710
it's up to you right the router should

1315
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:27,570
never rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that the oath is</font>

1316
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:29,460
able to understand it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offering it</font>

1317
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:32,400
to you this information you don't take

1318
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">it that's fine nothing will break right</font>

1319
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,140
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how like we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off as well</font>

1320
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,759
right and one of the things that came up

1321
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,500
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> people said we need some trust</font>

1322
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,510
in the person telling us this thing

1323
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">would make then you had to add like a</font>

1324
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:46,320
signature option on top of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on</font>

1325
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,629
and people say like Oh takes things are

1326
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,890
like like you know so 19th century we

1327
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:51,960
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> something more like you need you</font>

1328
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:53,609
your IDs and and that's the slope that

1329
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:56,520
like you know if you're gonna go down on

1330
01:04:53,610 --> 01:05:00,870
and because everybody wants a pony ride

1331
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:02,400
everywhere and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

1332
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:05,819
where to draw that line and i think this

1333
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,770
line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like to run okay we need to find</font>

1334
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right balance now regarding the</font>

1335
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:11,580
security next slide I get more on this

1336
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:13,200
just on this of course there is not

1337
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:15,210
enough security that we don't know why

1338
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">we get the second stage PVD</font>

1339
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,480
I believe this you can stand the

1340
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,950
interface you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kept it for</font>

1341
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,359
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't select this one I select</font>

1342
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:27,180
this one and I go so you like for

1343
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:32,670
instance yummy what I'm gonna talk about

1344
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:34,348
you Tommy no really mark<font color="#CCCCCC"> Townsley yessir</font>

1345
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:35,609
as you mentioned you know why is it

1346
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:38,460
different this time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has been</font>

1347
01:05:35,609 --> 01:05:41,490
around for a long time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in different</font>

1348
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:42,990
forms<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think two of the reasons and now</font>

1349
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:46,979
three you're standing at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> microphone</font>

1350
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:50,279
over there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know well now</font>

1351
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:54,390
there's two of them um and that's the

1352
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:57,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the host vendors are very seriously</font>

1353
01:05:54,390 --> 01:06:00,900
looking at this and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

1354
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:02,280
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they were</font>

1355
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:07,080
ignoring it before but I think it's

1356
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:09,480
pretty serious this time and also at

1357
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:12,598
speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on behalf of my company we're</font>

1358
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:16,050
starting to see enterprise networks that

1359
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:18,810
are seriously motivating us to deploy

1360
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:21,839
ipv6 only we're setting that I think

1361
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:24,660
ipv6 only as a sort of a predicate for

1362
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:28,109
this to even really be thought about and

1363
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:30,270
done properly and take off and we saw

1364
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:35,130
data from this morning in<font color="#CCCCCC"> map RG that</font>

1365
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:37,380
three percent of the of the hosts that

1366
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:39,780
Tommy C's or v6 only I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1367
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:43,040
stole his<font color="#E5E5E5"> thunder I'm sorry your turn'll</font>

1368
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:45,030
not that was Tommy Polly Appleman so I

1369
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:48,119
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all that I think some of</font>

1370
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:49,500
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> different is yeah we do have more</font>

1371
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:51,180
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> six we have more other things I</font>

1372
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">think what it comes down to is also</font>

1373
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:56,549
there's more of this multiple PVD stuff

1374
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:58,560
that's really going on and that we want

1375
01:06:56,550 --> 01:07:00,690
to be able to actually distinguish not

1376
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,950
just between oh yeah cell and Wi-Fi that

1377
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:03,359
like we figure that out a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

1378
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:05,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago but they're more cases which we have</font>

1379
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:07,410
these two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different uplinks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off the same</font>

1380
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,790
router we have homenet stuff going on

1381
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,440
it's getting more complex and that's

1382
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:13,980
becoming more of a reality that we need

1383
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to solve I get the point that yeah</font>

1384
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:18,150
everyone wants to put their pony into

1385
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:20,220
the RAS and stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> more stuff in to me as</font>

1386
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:21,869
one of the authors that's not the main

1387
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:23,430
point of this that is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1388
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:24,839
trying to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the main points that</font>

1389
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:26,700
you have multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> pv DS that you know</font>

1390
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:29,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about explicitly and so even if you just</font>

1391
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at it as I have different prefixes</font>

1392
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:32,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that these different prefixes</font>

1393
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,680
go to different<font color="#CCCCCC"> uplinks and that's all I</font>

1394
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,180
know there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra metadata that's</font>

1395
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:42,990
still really useful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that these</font>

1396
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:44,490
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different things yeah Tim China</font>

1397
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:46,859
i agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything marks i think</font>

1398
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:48,540
maybe is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the time is now is now</font>

1399
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:49,920
much more favorable for either there was

1400
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:53,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly a lot of feature creep in the</font>

1401
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier myth work on this but there is</font>

1402
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:57,750
also some good ideas things are

1403
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:59,970
distantly determining<font color="#CCCCCC"> PVD so you don't</font>

1404
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:03,210
necessarily have to have it in your face

1405
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:05,189
from an RA you can deduce the existence

1406
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:06,930
of a PVD from a set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information you</font>

1407
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:08,280
can say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's the sort of thing</font>

1408
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:12,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you vendor do incremental</font>

1409
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:15,390
deployment or<font color="#CCCCCC"> fee consider this one yeah</font>

1410
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:18,000
principally I think I mean to sure Ash's

1411
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:23,939
point I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that optional information</font>

1412
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:25,950
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to go but but but there I'm like</font>

1413
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:28,139
we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this as well i mean i</font>

1414
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:30,899

01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:32,820
discussion about this and it to me it's

1416
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:34,259
extremely important that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

that's given to you at the earliest

1419
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:42,899
applied to a given PVD so we don't want

<font color="#E5E5E5">the situation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where you get an RA and</font>

an ID in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packet so that as soon as</font>

this particular PVD<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's</font>

1435
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,479
something where we can look at the

1436
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:21,150
existing option that say these are

1437

hereby PVD specific and these are not

1438
01:09:21,149 --> 01:09:25,799
and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to say future options</font>

1439
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:29,700
should in their documents say whether

1440
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:32,760
they are or are not part of the PVD

1441
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:35,220
that's in the RA if any option is if any

such option is present<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we can we</font>

01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:14,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">about is what's the intended scope of</font>

supposed to put not only one line that

says all these of that but on this

1502
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:10,250
location do this on that location do

1503
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:13,140
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it becomes completely event</font>

1504
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:15,690
unmanageable<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font>

1505
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:17,489
having the ID that the user would

1506
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:18,780
actually poke into the data and make

1507
01:12:17,489 --> 01:12:21,599
decision that's completely unrealistic

1508
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:23,040
and imperfectly right if you wait for 23

1509
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,570
slide there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> project called neat</font>

01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,760
where couple of people here including

<font color="#CCCCCC">gory at least maybe others are working</font>

1512
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:32,040
on to provide something which is not

1513
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:35,700
ready directly to this PVD but leverage

1514
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:37,560
them with all about it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly to</font>

1515
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:41,010
finish the two three slides and I guess

1516
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:43,620
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be enough so that was yeah the</font>

bootstrap DVD then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second</font>

don't agree out to get the second stage

01:12:56,489 --> 01:13:02,099
we get by HTTPS or body in a sec we get

1524
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:04,230
the prefix again so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of close</font>

1526
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:10,259
a good level of security somehow we need

1527
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:11,969
to read in the Refresh to accept

1528
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:16,020

without the nap timer for UDP so that's

1535
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:30,270
important for timing again you don't

1536
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:33,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to take this information back on</font>

your choice and if you want it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

could even enter switch capital of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ?</font>

01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:42,960
here right link this to add pv for

make the link<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dhcp v4 information</font>

lines like 3gpp we have no choice right

01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,760
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want interface so one</font>

1553
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:20,650
router and beyond that so there is

1554
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:24,010
running code it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being some tests done</font>

1555
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:26,679
by to me like a ton a couple of times

1556
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago when you get two routers and we can</font>

1557
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:31,360

1558
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:34,270
wife I was back on the cellular uplink

1559
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:36,330
so when the cable modem which was cheap

1560
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:38,740
was done some application can disconnect

1561
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:41,500
so this over Wi-Fi rights which is not

1562
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:45,280
oh no matter this Wi-Fi connected back

1563
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:47,650
and over storyline in this case somebody

1564
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:50,559
changes where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox who understand</font>

1565
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:52,089
this particular of dvds example to come

1566
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,630
back to you Eric and Christian on this

1567
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:58,000
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> need project you can get the</font>

1568
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:59,290
pointers there's much more because

1569
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not need selecting the source</font>

1570
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:04,210
address but also the decision transport

1571
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:08,559
protocol v4 v6 or as quietly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I completed</font>

1572
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:11,250
here anyway not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run on my time next</font>

1573
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,530
step we<font color="#E5E5E5"> present this as well to v6 ops</font>

1574
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:16,420
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> well in later to be presented to the</font>

1575
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:19,389
captive portal working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font>

1576
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:22,120
eats a lot but we do believe the authors

1577
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:26,970
that this is the group where it belongs

1578
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:29,019
to so we expect some command reviews and

1579
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:33,310
hopefully being adopted as a working

1580
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:35,020
group item duration Sarah share um I I

1581
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:36,370
think you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1582
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:38,680
the list I don't think it's ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1583
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:40,210
even deciding whether it's very hard

1584
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,590
option or not so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> continued</font>

1585
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:45,430
discussion on the list and see how

1586
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:48,670
things go because<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I don't want</font>

1587
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:51,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">integrate to become myth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so uh if</font>

1588
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:53,620
there's like more work that's coming up

1589
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:56,440
like I would really like to keep that

1590
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:58,750
separate again because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1591
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:02,530
like you know like cherry to come and

1592
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:03,820
claim area on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this scary but I really</font>

1593
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:05,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this requires like lot more</font>

1594
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:07,690
discussion like before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go forward so</font>

1595
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,220
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bit premature but I think</font>

1596
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:11,969
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth discussing in interior I</font>

1597
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:14,650
think it's a good place to discuss trip

1598
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:17,290
Eric I would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to the apps</font>

1599
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:19,450
area early as opposed to wait because I

1600
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:22,180
suppose I'm finding out three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years down</font>

1601
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:23,739
the road you did what and you expect the

1602
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:25,900
applications to deal with go there

1603
01:16:23,739 --> 01:16:27,369
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and see do you think that</font>

1604
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,900
this is reasonable for the apps there

1605
01:16:27,369 --> 01:16:30,880
already some of them are already<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1606
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,829
it so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they think this is helpful</font>

1607
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,929
or maybe they think it's a bad idea but

1608
01:16:32,829 --> 01:16:36,849
finding out earlier than later is a good

1609
01:16:34,929 --> 01:16:39,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea this is pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good point thank you</font>

1610
01:16:36,849 --> 01:16:42,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so let's definitely take this</font>

1611
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:43,869
feedback back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list a mark mark</font>

1612
01:16:42,219 --> 01:16:47,230
note that you're bugging the room could

1613
01:16:43,869 --> 01:16:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">you please take over there's a comment</font>

1617
01:16:53,650 --> 01:17:01,268
do you prefer you take it to the list

1618
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:06,159
there's a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> about multicast over</font>

multicast over 80 to was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think</font>

01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:13,869
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft should also point out</font>

operational issues with weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap</font>

implementations that block multicast to

01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:40,860
this graft seems as good a place as any

1638
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:09,610
discussions and debates and digging

through various piles and piles and

1640
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:15,119
piles of rfcs and documents for terms

and things like that and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

awkward you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my back so there</font>

1648
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,070
was us there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a version</font>

01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:46,030
yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> or day before with a bit more</font>

nits<font color="#E5E5E5"> and such fixed in it there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

1653
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:51,849
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a terminology scrub</font>

1654
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:56,980
where the aim was to dig through the

1655
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:59,550
archives and use past terminology for

1656
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:03,339
things mostly run into you and such arm

1657
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:06,730
and associated references in the RFC

1658
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:09,540
series and only invent new terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1659
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:12,070
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed because it hadn't been</font>

1660
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:16,320
identified as a separate term in some

1661
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:19,809
other past document clarifications

1662
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:22,030
reorganizations fleshed out some of the

1663
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:24,460
you know existing protocols issues you

1664
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:25,960
know where we can identify that some

1665
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:28,719
existing tunneling protocol doesn't

1666
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:31,570
match this tunneling model that we're

1667
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:34,030
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define um a bit on load</font>

1668
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:36,790
balancing and a summary of

1669
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:39,639
recommendations which is in section 5

1670
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:42,010
and that relates to the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> status</font>

1671
01:19:39,639 --> 01:19:45,699
some of which I've already<font color="#CCCCCC"> given you a</font>

1672
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:49,719
review of but the real question that Joe

1673
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:52,150
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like the answer to is this</font>

1674
01:19:49,719 --> 01:19:54,760
third bullet point which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what's the</font>

1675
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:58,870
path forward this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already obviously</font>

1676
01:19:54,760 --> 01:20:01,780
working group document if the working

1677
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:04,300
group wants this to become a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp we will</font>

1678
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:08,019
do the extra work to<font color="#CCCCCC"> flush out section 5</font>

1679
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:10,389
which gives recommendations if the

1680
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:12,940
working group does not want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

1681
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:15,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">bcp or see some problem in it getting</font>

1682
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:17,080
published as such that's you know can

1683
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:19,540
convince us that it would be a waste of

1684
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:22,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">time we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will delete that section or most</font>

1685
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:24,909
of it and focus on the informational

1686
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:28,570
aspects which is sort of you know

1687
01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:32,049
pulling together this model description

1688
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:37,719
based on the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> tunneling that we've</font>

1689
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:39,659
done in in the ITF um I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1690
01:20:37,719 --> 01:20:44,230
have time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have Joe here uh</font>

1691
01:20:39,659 --> 01:20:47,409
to go into details about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this version I</font>

1692
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:51,160
very much would like people to review it

01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:54,849
and make those comments on list and we

1694
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:57,849
Joe and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> committed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know within a</font>

1695
01:20:54,850 --> 01:21:00,550
couple of weeks after<font color="#E5E5E5"> some decision on</font>

1696
01:20:57,850 --> 01:21:03,130
bcp<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus informational will give you</font>

1697
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:05,290
the next revision and be active as long

1698
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:07,540
as the list is active in order to get

1699
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:10,510
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> moved forward hopefully by working</font>

1700
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:12,790
group in Prague or or or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next IETF</font>

1701
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:16,330
but we kind of need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the answer</font>

1702
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:19,450
that fundamental third bullet<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and</font>

1703
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:22,990
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> input on that if you're</font>

1704
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:24,490
willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give it here today thank you</font>

1705
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:26,139
very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should shoot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1706
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:27,820
out on the mailing list we don't have

1707
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:30,310
less you say much time<font color="#CCCCCC"> now right now to</font>

1708
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:32,380
discuss but definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1709
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:34,420
question to answer the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp you or not</font>

1710
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:36,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that question has been already</font>

1711
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:39,850
asked on the mailing list so please

1712
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:44,670
respond and let us know thanks thank you

1713
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:44,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much for Omega</font>

1714
01:21:54,870 --> 01:22:01,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay for you Colette just a point of</font>

1715
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:03,040
order like you have a five-minute

1716
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:05,440
presentations lot and you have 16 slides

1717
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,670
so use the time however<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see fit but</font>

1718
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes okay</font>

1719
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:12,940
okay i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to distribute them a</font>

1720
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:15,270
colleague for all the slides so today

1721
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:17,980
we're going to discuss the IV v10 and

1722
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:21,160
for the first time people think that I

1723
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:24,009
bb10 is a new suit in a new structure

1724
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:26,860
for the IP version<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually it's not</font>

1725
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:28,720
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution that will solve the</font>

1726
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:30,849
problem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to discuss on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1727
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:34,960
slides first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all all of you know that</font>

1728
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:38,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> address space for ipv4 is 43 4.3</font>

1729
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:41,440
billion unique addresses and that the

1730
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:43,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">fast growth of the internet started to</font>

1731
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:46,750
make this address space to be exhausted

1732
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:49,780
and actually let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next slide</font>

1733
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:54,120
all the the five regional internet

1734
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:56,469
registries after iono almost all of them

1735
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:59,309
announces the depletion of the ipv4

1736
01:22:56,470 --> 01:23:03,660
address space which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big problem</font>

1737
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:03,660
that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to discuss next</font>

1738
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:23,910
4 seed upon for ipv6 is 95 not 98 Thank

1739
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:32,070
right we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical issue here we</font>

1740
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:33,540
lost a leg<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when he comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

1741
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:37,349
we'll come back to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

1742
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:49,860
meanwhile the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one online is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jordi</font>

1743
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:57,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Howlett can you talk now we cannot</font>

1744
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:57,200
hear you now it's a remote press enter

1745
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure your your microphone is not</font>

1746
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:13,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed it should be blue not great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1747
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,550
so let's try with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jordan well</font>

1748
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:31,099
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay uh well first first question</font>

1749
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:34,430
why we are presenting this here we

1750
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:37,310
believe this this belongs more to<font color="#CCCCCC"> basics</font>

1751
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:39,740
ops but basic subs done a standardized

1752
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:42,110
new protocols and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HCP they</font>

1753
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:45,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand the rise new option so we</font>

1754
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:49,339
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the middle of nowhere so</font>

1755
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:54,820
okay let's see I cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> see these lights</font>

1756
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:57,170
um basically the point here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we have</font>

1757
01:24:54,820 --> 01:25:00,410
different transition mechanisms that use

1758
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:04,220
not 64<font color="#CCCCCC"> Italy either is stateless or</font>

1759
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:08,420
stateful and in some situations you may

1760
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:14,210
need to have several net 64 boxes and we

1761
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:16,070
need a way to tell the clients how we

1762
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:18,560
need a way to provide the information to

1763
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:22,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients about good are they the</font>

1764
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:25,700
prefixes but ipv4 and ipv6 that those

1765
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:28,639
different not 64 boxes are able to

1766
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:34,250
handle for them basically what what we

1767
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:36,320
see is the need for ipv4 destination

1768
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:40,570
routing depending on the Box you are

1769
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:44,799
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um the proposal solution is</font>

1770
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:47,780
basically the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any other dhcpv6</font>

1771
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:50,660
option<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am NOT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to explain the</font>

1772
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:53,240
detail we don't have too much time I

1773
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:55,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's very detail it in also in the</font>

1774
01:25:53,240 --> 01:26:01,010
in the draft we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> updated it just a</font>

1775
01:25:55,910 --> 01:26:02,480
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> days ago we have aided the the</font>

1776
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:04,610
difference the main difference with the

1777
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:06,759
previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> version is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now we are also</font>

1778
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:15,259
incorporating suffix information

1779
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:18,080
following the nat64 a standard and well

1780
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:20,780
basically that's that's it we are

1781
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:23,390
seeking for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group adoption and</font>

1782
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:26,240
to move forward we believe it's even

1783
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:28,040
ready for last call we receive it just a

1784
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:31,610
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments in private we incorporated</font>

1785
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:34,489
them and i think it's it's done if we go

1786
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:40,790
for a for a working<font color="#CCCCCC"> group item and we</font>

1787
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:44,150
can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> immidiately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> less code very</font>

1788
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:46,460
much dear it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna see Apple um so</font>

1789
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:48,619
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a mechanism for detecting or</font>

1790
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:51,500
being formed in at six four boxes it's

1791
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:54,790
documented in RC 7050 and it uses dns

1792
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:58,070
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i add another one but if you have</font>

1793
01:26:54,790 --> 01:27:00,619
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing destinations base it</font>

1794
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:02,509
on it before that doesn't work that's

1795
01:27:00,619 --> 01:27:05,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explain it in the drop</font>

1796
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:09,050
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we needed this this</font>

1797
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:11,059
option and what networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deploying</font>

1798
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:13,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">this sorry we're cutting the lid</font>

1799
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:16,130
daylight yeah what networks are

1800
01:27:13,909 --> 01:27:17,989
deploying less well what's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1801
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:20,600
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having me this scenario</font>

1802
01:27:17,989 --> 01:27:23,959
described the goal is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able for</font>

1803
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:28,310
example to have different not 64 boxes

1804
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:30,290
in the same network that are handling

1805
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:33,350
the traffic for different ipv4

1806
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:36,260
destinations you can use IP routing in

1807
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:38,119
the network to do that right you can do

1808
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:40,219
sorry doing her back you can use IP

1809
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:43,040
routing in the network once you hit the

1810
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:46,070
road utinam to do with routing yes but

1811
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:48,889
we believe it's simple doing this with

1812
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:51,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">cydia sip dhcp version 6 option and</font>

1813
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:55,940
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way typically we do</font>

1814
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:57,230
everything Tommy Polly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple so I'm also</font>

1815
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:59,388
having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little trouble understanding</font>

1816
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:02,540
kind of what the use cases especially

1817
01:27:59,389 --> 01:28:04,070
for the host kind of going back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1818
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:06,920
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about with PVD s before</font>

1819
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:08,360
it seems like if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1820
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,699
know about multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nats explores and</font>

1821
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,839
how to use the differently that's really

1822
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:13,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">a case in which we really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1823
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,020
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have two different networks I'm</font>

1824
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,879
managing and that it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bigger</font>

1825
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:18,949
Peabody problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe in the PVD world</font>

1826
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,659
we have this and we know what the

1827
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:22,009
different things are but just adding

1828
01:28:20,659 --> 01:28:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">into dhcp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know how that's going</font>

1830
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:31,429
think we're cooking the discussion now

1831
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:33,110
one last short one sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> eskenazi to</font>

1832
01:28:31,429 --> 01:28:35,510
answer your point where you said well

1833
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:41,490
this is the HP v6 that's how we do

1834
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:45,160
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> no it isn't well I mean</font>

1835
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:50,730
yeah you're right but but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1836
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:50,730
make things simple this is the best way

1837
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:59,940
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's move to the least I</font>

1838
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:07,540
guess yes thank you we didn't get that

1839
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:17,790
harlot<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we move now to SD and</font>

1840
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:21,060
more casual look and please be brief

1841

1853
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:05,410
about four things number one is what is

<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem statement what you know what</font>

1855
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:11,559
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to solve and um what is</font>

1856
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:14,800
requirement for SDM multicast framework

1857
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:18,040
and number three what is the proposed

1858
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:23,740
framework and then we'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:25,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">next steps right excuse me so so first</font>

1860
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:27,490
of all what's what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

1861
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:29,530
statement um what's the problem in

1862
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:33,690
today's multicast solutions and number

1863
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:37,540
one is the their various multicast

1864
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:39,910
stability scalability<font color="#CCCCCC"> and negative</font>

1867
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:46,150

<font color="#E5E5E5">them some of the multicast protocol</font>

there's no unified really unified and

multicast security mechanisms are not

1915
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:08,969
provided in a uniform fashion and number

1916
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:12,199
six is really

1917
01:33:08,969 --> 01:33:16,940
of multicast telemetry information arm

1918
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:19,530
in a very fine grain detailed fashion so

1919
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:23,489
what's the framework what what we try to

1920
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:28,018
solve I mean what's genesis of this SDM

1921
01:33:23,489 --> 01:33:30,739
framework um we want to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

from from the routing 40 entries and

1924
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:41,969
unique ass right and number two a

01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:43,619
unified control playing across various

forwarding element in combinations

1927
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:47,249
whether you have I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're really</font>

1928
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:48,690
out of time you really need to summarize

1929
01:33:47,249 --> 01:33:50,340
if you want to like get the last word

1930
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:52,348
and do it now<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we had like three</font>

1931
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:54,659
minutes overtime<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so get your like</font>

1932
01:33:52,349 --> 01:34:01,920
slight Levin I think and then talk cool

1933
01:33:54,659 --> 01:34:05,429
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very quick thank you so sorry p</font>

01:34:13,079 --> 01:34:17,518
drafting this it's really well and we

1938
