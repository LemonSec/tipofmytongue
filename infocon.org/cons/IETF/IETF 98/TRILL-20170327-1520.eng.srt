00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:47,570
we've sort of come to the end of what I

144
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:49,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">think our operational issues we've gone</font>

145
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,860
through the active active we've gone

146
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,049
through the directory assistance

147
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:59,510
multi-level<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick thing ah thank</font>

148
00:19:54,049 --> 00:20:03,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">you is there is it here oh there it is I</font>

149
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:09,110
got it nope that didn't work well let me

150
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:12,620
go back okay one more so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

151
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:17,030
have the trill data center interface and

152
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:20,809
we have the trill we have some true

153
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:23,090
trill transport over mpls<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will try I</font>

154
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:25,789
think most of those graphs are fairly

155
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:30,080
well cooked I will ask you to please

156
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:32,629
review the yang documents will cover

157
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,250
next what you're hearing me say is I

158
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we're sort of to the end of</font>

159
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:40,429
several large pieces of work but the

160
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:42,799
only thing hanging out is is security

161
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:48,740
that we've got some individual drafts

162
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:52,100
and the any urgent thing we hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

163
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you we're at a place where most working</font>

164
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,809
groups go into a hiatus or

165
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,790
sort of go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a death rebirth thing</font>

166
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:02,370
this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> because technology isn't</font>

167
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:05,428
working it's because in reality you've

168
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:07,260
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really really good job with we've</font>

169
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:08,970
gotten through a whole bunch of stuff I

170
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,790
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've gotten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to all the product</font>

171
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,740
lines what they need for those who are

172
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,830
shipping trill product it would be or

173
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,600
trill sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> product tell us if we've</font>

174
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,270
gotten everything but we've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

175
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,730
focus on what we've got if there's

176
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,559
something we needed we're heading toward

177
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> G we've gotten through the first</font>

178
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:31,290
piece we've defined everything will let

179
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">it set if there's some urgent problem</font>

180
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,659
i'm sure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s will pick up and move</font>

181
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,720
it out but we're at that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know coming</font>

182
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to one end why is that important i</font>

183
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,330
really want to get all the rfcs through

184
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:50,059
the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> can I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably send it ten</font>

185
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:53,189
times now hope read the dress<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

186
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:56,160
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> documents we have done you</font>

187
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:58,740
see this status and these are milestones

188
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,410
and looking with these milestones we're

189
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:05,700
going to readapt the milestones or out

190
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:08,730
of faith but we will we've completed a

191
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:11,670
whole bunch this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a tremendous working</font>

192
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:14,520
group its technical capabilities have

193
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:16,500
been a joy to work with but we have a

194
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,800
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> overdue mostly because we've</font>

195
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:23,220
recycled a couple of these in review I'd

196
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:26,340
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to catch up our interviews and we</font>

197
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,650
were going to recharter or shut down the

198
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,139
working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we're going</font>

199
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make July we may be november but i</font>

200
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,790
think we're heading toward that hiatus

201
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,220
that's your chair trying to so if you

202
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,678
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some challenge on that that's where</font>

203
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think we're heading again because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

204
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,940
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we finished let me give you an</font>

205
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,490
example of another working group that

206
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,530
went through this bgp went through a

207
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,380
whole long cycle where we had a whole

208
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:55,590
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work and then we went into hiatus</font>

209
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,600
for a while we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of say that because</font>

210
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,428
we really didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in something</font>

211
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,949
interesting to say but then when we came

212
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:04,140
back we had a lot of interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

213
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,480
to say and we're still finding things

214
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,519
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are changing in the BGP environment</font>

215
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,649
is just for a while

216
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:15,839
we weren't changing so take this to be

217
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:19,039
like trill like bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay John I think I</font>

218
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,039
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick up the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next one</font>

219
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:44,190
okay how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people here have worked</font>

220
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:48,110
with yang I think he's out okay good now

221
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:52,260
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a little bit of talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

222
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:56,100
challenge when we had our yang models

223
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:58,710
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trilling which is the basic</font>

224
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,050
configuration the p.m. and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the OEM the</font>

225
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">PM which actually works out the ohm we</font>

226
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:05,340
did a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work ahead of everyone else</font>

227
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,580
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> tisa thought it would be a</font>

228
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:14,189
really good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have lime and to</font>

229
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:16,500
make the true model go under lime lime

230
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:20,130
is finishing its work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

231
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:24,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it got to everything we thought it</font>

232
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:26,580
would so I'm faced with three options

233
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:29,850
and I just for those who are working

234
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,100
with gang and drill option one is the

235
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:35,250
working group last call and send through

236
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the process the modules because it's my</font>

237
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:40,560
understanding from deepak<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe</font>

238
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,620
other people who have implementations

239
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:46,080
that you have implementations of the

240
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing drill gang models they will not</font>

241
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,429
be exactly up to latest snuff off for

242
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:55,949
some of the requirements and format so

243
00:24:53,430 --> 00:25:00,240
some stuff is easy for format to change

244
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:02,100
and some stuff is fairly hard my first

245
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,320
option is we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to really</font>

246
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,080
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hard changes we're going to</font>

247
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,510
say these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are adopted and used in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

248
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,780
case I will collect from deepak<font color="#CCCCCC"> and any</font>

249
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:16,620
work view that have drill and figuration

250
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:21,379
yang models the information and send it

251
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:28,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg the second option is to</font>

252
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:30,960
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trill p.m. and OEM to be</font>

253
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">dependent on line that means you have</font>

254
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,390
the line base and then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do new</font>

255
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,360
models for that d<font color="#CCCCCC"> fox original comment</font>

256
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:44,700
to me an email was no I'd rather stay

257
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,889
with the original gang model<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we can</font>

258
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,800
do both but that takes a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy</font>

259
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,960
I'm well

260
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,810
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start now</font>

261
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:58,720
because yang models have taken us a

262
00:25:52,810 --> 00:26:01,960
while any<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback you sound</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

263
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see we take option one first you</font>

264
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:09,390
want option one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be and</font>

265
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,390
your implementation wants option one

266
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:16,389
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> without ID imitations oh yes I'm</font>

267
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:20,679
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> kak task that is chairing know and</font>

268
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:22,810
know the answer yes ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have cisco</font>

269
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,550
and while we wanting that and i will

270
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:27,429
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> go with option one that was</font>

271
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:30,120
your answers two implementations we're

272
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:32,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">going forward ah by the way my</font>

273
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,530
definition of interoperability<font color="#E5E5E5"> is two</font>

274
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:40,060
implementations in the field that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

275
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:42,580
prejudiced by my work in BGP if anyone

276
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,770
wants both you must tell me within this

277
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,530
week<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we'll go on and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will tell</font>

278
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:51,100
the lime chair that's nice if you get

279
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:52,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone to volunteer go forth but we're</font>

280
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:57,280
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay focused on the first</font>

281
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,500
option<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and if you feel shy about the</font>

282
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,340
mic come and talk to me afterwards but i

283
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,800
will make a fairly call um let me just

284
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,990
give you a little information about some

285
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,870
of the challenges now that I've gone

286
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,150
through the major question which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

287
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:17,139
of the challenges that is that in the

288
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:18,850
future in the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lime time frame we</font>

289
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,980
would have to work with the revised

290
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:24,520
datastore and revised data stores

291
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:27,640
changed the OP state to be separate than

292
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:32,320
the rest it also has taken dynamic data

293
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:36,550
stores such as trill<font color="#E5E5E5"> r2s might be into</font>

294
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,879
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and I've gone through some of</font>

295
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:41,560
that already with one I think I've gone

296
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,490
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let me see if I can get to</font>

297
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next slide set</font>

298
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:10,820
it's mohammad so he's remote and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

299
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:14,450
never done them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my old wise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

300
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:22,760
i'll just bring up the slides for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

301
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:30,309
how do we pumped his voice speaks like

302
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:30,309
big me Lord Hey look at

303
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:50,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have to write one up in it</font>

304
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:05,370
thank you go ahead hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone hello</font>

305
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:11,970
we're joining it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hey yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay click</font>

306
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:14,429
enjoy okay thank you so in this document

307
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:18,230
what we are going to discuss hear it I'm

308
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:21,780
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FGL into the trail headed so</font>

309
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:26,040
how we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is we're going to</font>

310
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:32,100
subsequent slice so this presentation

311
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:34,470
flowers at the orem making<font color="#CCCCCC"> FGL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Tantalus</font>

312
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:38,850
against is contagious as in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the present</font>

313
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:43,350
is eliminating 32 digital space

314
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:46,080
invention<font color="#E5E5E5"> for forums for bringing FJ</font>

315
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:50,090
equal<font color="#E5E5E5"> to negative evidence emerging ever</font>

316
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:54,810
so what exactly all and again inhale was

317
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:57,959
in the inner head under the original

318
00:29:54,810 --> 00:30:03,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">date our Garrett is so what we have</font>

319
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:05,700
thought out LG refrigerator and this

320
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,770
document proposes changes in the actual

321
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,700
package structure that is describing the

322
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:16,639
subsequent<font color="#E5E5E5"> section of this document in</font>

323
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,640
the good next leg

324
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:26,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is how the present svenska</font>

325
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:29,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">train so we can see and after in the mac</font>

326
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:33,020
source address we have ethertype that is

327
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:37,639
893<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and we have two parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is in</font>

328
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:40,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> label and high pot and in the label</font>

329
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,580
low part and sometimes it is little bit

330
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:47,060
confusing that why it has been

331
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:52,389
discontinued so this way we're thinking

332
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:57,889
of bringing that FGL into trill header

333
00:30:52,390 --> 00:31:01,640
so can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we and again another problem here</font>

334
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:04,690
is the ethertype we have again in four

335
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:10,790
bytes of ethertype so that is again the

336
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:13,240
waste of means<font color="#E5E5E5"> four bytes can go for</font>

337
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,240
next life

338
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:23,160
yeah that is what I discussed in the

339
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:27,510
previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FGL is given to two</font>

340
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:29,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">pots and 12</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit higher order and to alva</font>

341
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:37,020
to order part which sometimes is

342
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:38,700
confusing and it is also if Jill added

343
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,680
or removed in the original frame space

344
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,550
which causes forehead in the processing

345
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:48,390
on the edge are bitches so what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

346
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:51,440
doing now here is that we are adding FGL

347
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:55,350
and removing edge here in the original

348
00:31:51,440 --> 00:32:04,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">french space that is Wikipedia overhead</font>

349
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:07,709
on the edge or bridges next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

350
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:11,090
so what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing here is we are</font>

351
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:14,220
proposing a new frame structure where

352
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:18,419
FGL header will come maybe side the

353
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:22,380
trail header so you can see the original

354
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">header will be reminding that if someone</font>

355
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,390
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be don't want to change</font>

356
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:31,590
anything this original packet will

357
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:33,390
impact will remain intact<font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas FGL</font>

358
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:40,459
header will take off take care of the

359
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:40,460
late FG 11 yeah can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

360
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:48,600
this is how it looks like so trill

361
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:53,340
header is whatever we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using as of</font>

362
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:57,270
now so FGL header it is having that is

363
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:59,580
in the town so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see here we have</font>

364
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:05,340
some information regarding a chill

365
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:08,070
headed I beat our<font color="#E5E5E5"> with key priority</font>

366
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:13,669
field and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are bringing entropy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> labor</font>

367
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:16,590
also and the entropy label is because

368
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:20,670
what we now have is that we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

369
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:25,790
all to the deep packet inspection to

370
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:28,710
find out for doing a load balancing on

371
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:31,149
course I'd means if in<font color="#CCCCCC"> for our bridges</font>

372
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,559
if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy empty pots</font>

373
00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:35,768
we have to do a deep packet inspection

374
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,080
for load balancing so I that what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

375
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:40,779
thinking is to bring entropy a new

376
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:52,029
entity called entropy<font color="#E5E5E5"> level the HCL</font>

377
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:54,460
header skin next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so this this is</font>

378
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:57,219
how it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we come back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

379
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:00,700
a strill<font color="#CCCCCC"> hider and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HCL header you can</font>

380
00:33:57,219 --> 00:34:07,089
see here that FGM rider will come after

381
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:09,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">English</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nickname so we will we can go to</font>

382
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:20,649
next slide where I will discuss each and

383
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:23,020
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> in speed next slide please this is</font>

384
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:26,469
the trill Heather party same as

385
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:30,009
described in RFC wh 0 with<font color="#E5E5E5"> few changes</font>

386
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:33,939
in its version field we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

387
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:36,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">change it with a new version means</font>

388
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:39,970
bringing it when your value right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

389
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:42,119
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 so it might be one so that</font>

390
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:46,449
indicates that the trill header has an

391
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:49,869
axial header so if Jill header is

392
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:52,598
described as below so I beat is one bit

393
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:55,599
field when set indicates valid HDL is

394
00:34:52,599 --> 00:35:03,640
presented so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arvid is one bit field</font>

395
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:05,619
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a result in next life ok he</font>

396
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,660
field is a two-bit field whose value

397
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:12,099
provides information on the National

398
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:15,368
that is priority field so the priority

399
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:17,380
field incredible value<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 of people</font>

400
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:19,599
indicates that reality field is offered

401
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:26,670
from the inner wheel and header which is

402
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:29,579
a forwarding including DC I means DC the

403

eligibility drop eligibility indicator

404
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:36,369
and so for most significant bit will be

405
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:38,920
in use or priority for least significant

406
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:41,170
bits should be set to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 and ignored by</font>

doing packet forwarding position

408
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:55,660
and so can they go for next<font color="#E5E5E5"> level okay</font>

409
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,730
value1 non-people indicates that clarity

<font color="#E5E5E5">here is to we have a big deep packet</font>

451
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:02,920
have to do a deep inspection so by

452
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,960
bringing in trophy<font color="#CCCCCC"> level what we are</font>

453
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:10,200
trying to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is again we are giving a</font>

454
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:14,950
free hand to means unless later or

455
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:18,069
someone who want like whether he<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

456
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:20,259
use an inner ear<font color="#E5E5E5"> two hitters are in the</font>

457
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:23,970
l3 headers and you don't do a deep

458
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:27,010
packet inspection and without that doing

459
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:37,750
entropy<font color="#E5E5E5"> level will help us to do a load</font>

460
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:41,080
balancing and it's like okay so now FGL

461
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:44,200
will come here after this entropy level

462
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,360
this fine grind level is a 24-bit level

463
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,759
which is same as<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it was earlier</font>

464
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,630
so what we have married this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

465
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,350
contiguous later cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> this contributes so</font>

466
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:58,890
this indicates the frame belongs to it

467
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:01,960
which particular broadcast segments so

468
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:08,470
on top of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have reserved for</font>

469
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:17,650

470
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:19,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">next line so what exactly it will</font>

474
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,040
turn on me cmp for our bridges and

475
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:32,770
achieving of qos until can be done based

476
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,779
on customers requirement and top of that

477
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:38,170
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do here is that there are</font>

478
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,870
some models in mpls for achieving<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

479
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:42,940
like white model short fight model all

480
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:46,000
those things we can bring into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trail</font>

481
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:49,330
also alert if really and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some customer</font>

482
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,730
wants it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that but for</font>

483
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,770
achieving us until what I can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

484
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:57,390
is that right now we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font>

485
00:39:53,770 --> 00:40:01,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">much of free hand provided to the</font>

486
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:04,509
administrator if he wants to stay

487
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,700
whatever is there in the trail header is

488
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:11,590
indicating to him or if you want to

489
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:14,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">change so we can give him a free hand if</font>

490
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,660
you want to take the decision based on

491
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:19,570
the inner headers which in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hidden</font>

492
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:22,600
there is a to head up our l3 hidden if

493
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:26,380
l3 header means again how he want to do

494
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:29,860
it so by bringing this priority field

495
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:35,680
into FGL header<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we are giving a</font>

496
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:37,630
free hand to a customer r2r

497
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,480
administrator how he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font>

498
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:42,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision and another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that is most</font>

499
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,250
important is that a change of different

500
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:47,230
mode of services easily like we land

501
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,520
based service instance we learn bundle

502
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,110
service instance

503
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:55,780
we learn our bundles resistance<font color="#E5E5E5"> etc so</font>

504
00:40:52,110 --> 00:41:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will become very easy when we bring a</font>

505
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:13,510
team outside the inner header we can go

506
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:16,750
for next line next like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

507
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:22,870
what i have so any comments on the

508
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:27,240
proposed idea is always welcome so well

509
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:33,819
Donald's going to the mic let me ask an

510
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:37,830
operational question this proposal hints

511
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:41,950
that you've got customers who are

512
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:47,170
leading these changes can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you provide</font>

513
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:51,970
some more detail on why the original

514
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:55,300
stuff original fine-grained label wasn't

515
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:58,359
able to accomplish some of these pieces

516
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:00,580
and what your customer scenario don't

517
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,620
give enough so we can tell the customer

518
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:06,810
but if you would just give us a little

519
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:09,700
background on what customers you're

520
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:12,820
working with why it's important to them

521
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:16,419
that would really help<font color="#CCCCCC"> me in my</font>

522
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:19,570
evaluation so all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> no we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

523
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:23,320
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers as of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now so what we can</font>

524
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:26,500
see the different technologies for we

525
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:31,540
are like what we have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is tell</font>

526
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:35,950
always means want to have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

527
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:39,000
FGL to be outside the inner packet

528
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:42,279
headers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we are doing here we are</font>

529
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:47,140
putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> FGL inside a inner packet header</font>

530
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:52,660
so they always have means want it will

531
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:55,750
be outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and top of it as I told</font>

532
00:42:52,660 --> 00:43:00,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that entropy level what we here we are</font>

533
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:02,840
proposing will have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will give</font>

534
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,400
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good chance for load distribution</font>

535
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:08,490
there as the condo in deep packet

536
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:11,460
inspection that that will bring a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

537
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:15,149
overhead to the for our bridges so it

538
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:18,600
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go all the way in split in order</font>

539
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:21,810
to freeze energy fields so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also</font>

540
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:23,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">chillin of us until what will we right</font>

541
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:27,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">now we are doing is we are using</font>

542
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:30,839
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> land header outer wheel and</font>

543
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:33,870
header if the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like PPP we</font>

544
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:38,280
don't have Ellen headers also right so

545
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:42,060
and also the means a lot of models that

546
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have in kos like pipe model universal</font>

547
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:49,470
modern and sharp<font color="#CCCCCC"> white model that is in</font>

548
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:53,130
mpls get some so to bring all these

549
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:55,770
things i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere we need to make</font>

550
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:58,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">this FGL means to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sexy and</font>

551
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:01,470
outside the inner header and to put in

552
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:03,990
the trail header I did it will become

553
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:07,680
easier so because sometimes it is

554
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:12,240
confusing when we see the ethertype well

555
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:16,950
if two times it has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeated so so</font>

556
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:20,520
we are wasting you around some<font color="#E5E5E5"> two plus</font>

557
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:24,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">two means four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> byes where to tell that</font>

558
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:29,730
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a third type so that's where</font>

559
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:31,950
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that will this</font>

560
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:35,820
will improve some of the things which

561
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:37,560
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> atl is not having so frankly</font>

562
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:43,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">speaking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are no customers as of no</font>

563
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:50,730
vertices as a mincer proposed means IDF

564
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:54,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunny and Donald</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me summarize</font>

565
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:57,660
because some of the meat echoes coming

566
00:44:54,330 --> 00:45:00,120
in but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's trimming parts of your words</font>

567
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,310
so I'm going to just summarize what I

568
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:07,680
think I heard and please correct me and

569
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:10,290
I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the the quality seems to</font>

570
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,100
just put certain things so my

571
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:16,279
understanding from what you just said

572
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:19,790
is you have some what I guess would be

573
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:23,720
data center customers that need a lot of

574
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:27,020
ecmp you have other customers outside

575
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:32,390
the data center that are attached to

576
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:35,750
VPNs who need some of the split<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font>

577
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:38,060
the fine-grained labeling has and then

578
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:43,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not sure about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the third case</font>

579
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:44,750
whether you have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> QSR</font>

580
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:48,430
requirements based on a particular

581
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:51,770
application voice or something else I

582
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:55,819
again I apologize but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

583
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:59,360
characterize you know the needs because

584
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:04,220
data centers our news needs combining

585
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:06,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">them with exterior some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Q s is new needs</font>

586
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,430
if you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

587
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,960
Donald if you heard it better on the

00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:14,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">types of users you're welcome to</font>

589
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:21,380
Commodore John if you if you heard any

590
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:25,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">more on the user's animals and before</font>

591
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:32,930
that yeah this answer go ahead and

592
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:38,210
answer mark did I understand your types

593
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:41,390
of users correctly and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need and</font>

594
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:44,450
actually so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no customer as of</font>

595
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:47,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">know so this anyone who want this</font>

596
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:51,500
proposal so this proposal is like after

597
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:54,020
seeing lot of other technologies so who

598
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:57,980
has a FGL kind of header which is

599
00:46:54,020 --> 00:47:00,500
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the means original header so</font>

600
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:02,450
that's where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring it</font>

601
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:09,110
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any customers as of</font>

602
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:11,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">now so if you bring it but Cupid's to</font>

603
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:16,250
perceive a particular customer market

604
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:18,200
thank you for confirming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not do</font>

605
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:21,170
you perceive a particular market that

606
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:26,410
this will help you reach I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

607
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sense of</font>

608
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:43,060
the push to change a header and you talk

609
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:46,549
about that justjust for my background I

610
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:50,690
think those definitely someone will come

611
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:54,710
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us means and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hear is a</font>

612
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:59,450
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of customers are like because of FGL</font>

613
00:47:54,710 --> 00:48:03,920
that is inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original header the</font>

614
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:06,379
customers is really not understanding

615
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:12,470
what exactly why exactly it should be

616
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:16,850
inside it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you um just a</font>

617
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:20,359
minute down over<font color="#E5E5E5"> in drama theme I'm</font>

618
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:21,920
asking about use cases I mean I won't

619
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,620
along that line I'm I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of</font>

620
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,880
curious if if you don't know this to the

621
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:29,210
customers are what the scope of their

622
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,730
problem is you know how tightly bound it

623
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:33,740
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're looking for I mean you</font>

624
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:39,830
already have alternatives lined up if

625
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:45,740
you cannot get this achieved excuse me

626
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:49,310
it I think they're basically I'm curious

627
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:51,169
is what is your plan B if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't get</font>

628
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:57,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">this to work how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want it to what</font>

629
00:48:51,170 --> 00:49:00,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">what what is your alternative path I</font>

630
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:03,979
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any plan their loneliness</font>

631
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:08,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer as if how it is going on</font>

632
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:10,670
it for example how we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using a chair</font>

633
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,830
as of now continue with it if no one is

634
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:19,610
ready to accept it and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> better if</font>

635
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:23,060
we have some kind of new draft in the

636
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:26,290
drug ship and someone is then ready to

637
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,290
try it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

638
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,000
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you very much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more now</font>

639
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:36,069
on to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question well is</font>

640
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,050
not least like before way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wanted</font>

641
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:40,839
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a couple comments and think I</font>

642
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe one of the things is that the</font>

643
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:45,549
existing FGL standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have some slides</font>

644
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:48,220
to go after<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned that existing</font>

645
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:50,800
FGL standard hasn't actually been

646
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:54,759
implemented in<font color="#E5E5E5"> merchants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iligan kind of</font>

647
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:58,780
a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this proposal by making</font>

648
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:01,390
the FGL field contiguous to make it

649
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:03,550
easier for never processors to handle it

650
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:06,009
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of other aspects of it</font>

651
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:08,319
they're designed to make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast path</font>

652
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:12,690
implementation easier so that it can be

653
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:14,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">done better with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network processors or</font>

654
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:18,329
you know would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> implement in</font>

655
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:22,020
and so uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> burton silicon in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

656
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:24,490
and that's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> this little point</font>

657
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,349
these lights here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was thinking they</font>

658
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:28,390
proposed changing the version number

659
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:32,470
which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a big deal in the</font>

660
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:35,410
trouble petrolhead<font color="#CCCCCC"> er there's other ways</font>

661
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:36,939
of doing it which would be are there are

662
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:38,348
these there's some flag fields in the

663
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:42,069
trail header which are critical flags

664
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:43,750
over there said they would cause any

665
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:45,609
switch that didn't understand it to

666
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:48,339
reject it which don't require changing

667
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:50,560
the version at all we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one bit in</font>

668
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:52,869
that area is the bit which currently

669
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,210
indicates that the optional flags word

670
00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:58,480
is present so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can use another bid in</font>

671
00:50:55,210 --> 00:51:01,480
that area to indicate that the FGL a

672
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,550
header information was present so I

673
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:07,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little easier than</font>

674
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:09,250
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the version of them the</font>

675
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:11,170
only thing I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I really creative</font>

676
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:13,030
mode yes depend on merchants loca

677
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:17,280
implementations of it there were

678
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:17,280
customers basic implementation

679
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:27,780
Margaret Colin<font color="#E5E5E5"> from pain land security</font>

680
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:30,480
um the first question I have I guess is

681
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:32,040
uh I did we'll go over the drafts for

682
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,589
this meeting but I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find this one</font>

683
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:38,970
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the draft that this is</font>

684
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:41,700
documented<font color="#E5E5E5"> in but but these changes is</font>

685
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:43,439
their draft for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will not</font>

686
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:47,430
feel guilty that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm asking questions</font>

687
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:53,160
based only on looking at the slides page

688
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:58,890
eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it was slide 8</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font>

689
00:51:53,160 --> 00:52:01,190
question about this it sounded like

690
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:05,700
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a new header version</font>

691
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:08,099
that says that the header that follows

692
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:10,410
is an FTL header and then we're going to

693
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:14,550
have a bit in the FGL header that says

694
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:16,830
it's a valid FGL header now what is it

695
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:19,140
if that it isn't set an invalid FGL

696
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:21,359
header<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I don't I don't understand</font>

697
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,310
what the is that space always going to

698
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,569
be reserved but if that fits one we

699
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,160
should do something with it and if not

700
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:28,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">it should be all zeros I don't</font>

701
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,960
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this needs that I've</font>

702
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:34,470
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm not quite as upset with</font>

703
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:38,010
because this scene there another routing

704
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:40,618
dress as they try to migrate versions of

705
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:42,540
header so is this is that what it means

706
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:45,180
the space will always be reserved it

707
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:48,720
will be all 0 is that what you're

708
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:51,359
proposing I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure if your name is</font>

709
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,250
Mohammed or<font color="#E5E5E5"> umair and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not sure</font>

710
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:56,130
what to call you<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sorry could you let</font>

711
00:52:53,250 --> 00:53:01,290
me know yeah you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably do a lot</font>

712
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:07,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of more models and yeah all you want you</font>

713
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:11,450
can call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it Fortuna okay yeah yeah so</font>

714
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:15,480
now about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I beta so for example</font>

715
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:19,919
might be will use FGL for some of the

716
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:24,150
reservation<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose sometimes the htl</font>

717
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:28,230
values might be all zeros so then we can

718
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:30,210
tell that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a invalid FGL value</font>

719
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:32,100
which is there in this header and you

720
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,440
can directly drop it

721
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:40,290
so that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purpose why we are</font>

722
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:44,010
linking the I bit so if this is not the

723
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:47,490
way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> commence like to handle it I</font>

724
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:49,980
think we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have time and we can</font>

725
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:52,259
think about it but right now the main

726
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:56,730
intention is if something which is all

727
00:53:52,260 --> 00:54:01,020
the value is<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero then implicate the art</font>

728
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:05,070
bridges to directly drop that frame<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

729
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:06,690
and then I had a question about a few

730
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,340
slides from now there was if the value

731
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:12,120
is one of the values to with the values

732
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:14,280
three there we go um one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

733
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you should at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least consider here</font>

734
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:22,400
is that deciding what to do by<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

735
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,360
at a value and then a field is

736
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,130
computationally more expensive right

737
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:29,510
than just deciding what to do based on a

738
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:34,500
field and I wonder if it's possible um

739
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:38,970
and I'd have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look and think no to</font>

740
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:41,070
have a way that we encode one field that

741
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:43,290
could be as much as 10 bits long because

742
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:45,270
you're one two and three are going to

743
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:47,640
take two bits plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a bit field</font>

744
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:51,509
right if we have a way to encode one

745
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,520
field that we could map all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> values</font>

746
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:55,290
to so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a consistent set of</font>

747
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:00,509
fields instead of having three different

748
00:54:55,290 --> 00:55:03,720
types is something I would wonder about

749
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:05,460
in terms of if there's a meaningful way

750
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,009
to do it i mean if they're completely

751
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,870
disparate information that they're

752
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:11,490
trying then then we are sort of mapping

753
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:13,680
to it by having one two three at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

754
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:17,029
front right but is there a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

755
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:21,240
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> map these to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meaningful</font>

756
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:22,980
in some simple way like for instance are

757
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,359
the three bits really indicating

758
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,300
something that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be mapped into the</font>

759
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:30,110
eight bits i I don't know I know that

760
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:33,110
the three that toss field has previously

761
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:36,240
for various<font color="#CCCCCC"> things being mapped into</font>

762
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:38,640
other types of traffic class fields like

763
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dip surf field and I wonder if we</font>

764
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:45,759
could get two to one set of information

765
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:50,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have a trill header with map values</font>

766
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:52,600
from the other fields<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

767
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:55,270
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my only other comment is on the</font>

768
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,440
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> why don't you answer that question</font>

769
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:59,920
i'll give my<font color="#E5E5E5"> other comment when you're</font>

770
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:03,360
done so go ahead and the reason behind

771
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,760
why this these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are dope fields because</font>

772
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:11,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">one it indicates that convey we have</font>

773
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:14,320
copied is miss Perry liquid then when we

774
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:18,430
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to copy it back means when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

775
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">going out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 30 campus so if some</font>

776
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:23,770
customer want in such a way that if you

777
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:26,890
want to copy the priority bits back to

778
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:30,970
its original hidden so it will help him

779
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:33,759
to know which very he has to copy it

780
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:36,339
back so whether it is n2 header there is

781
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">LT hidden so where exactly you want to</font>

782
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:41,380
copy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's why we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have divided do</font>

783
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:43,779
you think it might be modified these

784
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:46,690
fields might be modified in transit yes

785
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:49,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct yes that's why it means we have</font>

786
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:52,840
I mean different type of models in qos

787
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:55,750
as what I was discussing like we have

788
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,610
pipe model me hair and universal model

789
00:56:55,750 --> 00:57:01,660
we have short pipe model these models

790
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:04,270
means means each model is different from

791
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:06,460
other in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case where sometimes we</font>

792
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:08,140
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy it back sometimes we</font>

793
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:11,260
want to copy it back to the virginal

794
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:13,440
header so the reason is just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

795
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:16,150
edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrbridge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will indicate that</font>

796
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,890
where you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to copy it back means</font>

797
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:21,190
whether to the end to head over a

798
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:24,190
three-headed the first two bits which is

799
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:26,920
in the FP field will help to the

800
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:31,450
averages edge our beaches where you want

801
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,820
to copy Trevor yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty sure it</font>

802
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:38,049
is it safe to modify all of these are

803
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:42,340
empaths so but um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I Donald wants to</font>

804
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:44,080
say something about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't want</font>

805
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,270
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> margot has another comment but i just</font>

806
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,160
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that there seems to</font>

807
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:50,470
be enough space in this FGL header that

808
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,560
you can preserve these things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

809
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:56,410
copy them into their but at some level

810
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:58,960
the current drill architecture assumes

811
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:04,089
that there's always a

812
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:08,140
for bit handling priority for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> drill</font>

813
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:09,640
data packet and basically the grotto

814
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,750
eligibility and the three bits of

815
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:15,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">priority and the trill switch ports are</font>

816
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:17,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bridgeport's and they could have these 8</font>

817
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:19,870
q's having additional information<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

818
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">is fine but it's sort of would be good</font>

819
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:26,640
if there was a spirit priority<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

820
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:30,310
wonder crop eligibility field available

821
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:32,650
and having additional information which

822
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,940
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but the exit the trill</font>

823
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:36,970
architectures would have assumes there's

824
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:44,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bit summary of the priority for</font>

825
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:46,689
handling things and then the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third</font>

826
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,950
thing I wanted to ask about let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me try</font>

827
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,420
to remember what it was can you just go

828
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:52,000
forward a little bit on the slides

829
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:55,360
because I'm maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll come back oh um</font>

830
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,720
go back 10 one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

831
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:01,720
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into with attempts to calculate</font>

832
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,970
entropy is if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one way to do it</font>

833
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a good hash algorithm you will get</font>

834
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:10,689
an even distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

835
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:14,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">have multiple ways to do it you get a</font>

836
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:19,240
less even distribution right because you

837
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:22,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">are hashing on different stuff I think</font>

838
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,189
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look into and I need to see</font>

839
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:26,050
actual text this is it like enough

840
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:28,060
information for me to make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> judgment</font>

841
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:31,120
but when you do that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

842
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:32,770
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you talk to some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dirty</font>

843
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,240
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font>

844
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,700
whatever you're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with with we</font>

845
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,109
might use this or we might use that

846
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:40,629
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to result in an even</font>

847
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:42,460
hash distribution because that isn't

848
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:44,560
always the case if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use these</font>

849
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:46,810
fields or those fields or some other

850
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:49,630
fields and then the hash algorithm also

851
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:51,460
has to be well well defined in order to

852
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:55,840
come up with an even distribution so

853
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:57,550
that was my only<font color="#E5E5E5"> other comment that was</font>

854
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:03,220
just random advice worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you paid</font>

855
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:07,890
for it Thank You<font color="#E5E5E5"> market is there any</font>

856
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions or comments for uma</font>

857
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:16,430
okay we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take this draft to the list</font>

858
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,150
and have further discussions it's the

859
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:22,549
first draft well you would do me a favor

860
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:24,890
if you would think a little bit about

861
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:27,829
the use case you might deploy in this

862
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:29,720
and send me a note on that thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

863
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:32,450
i would add<font color="#CCCCCC"> were the greatest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font>

864
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:34,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">a way of encouraging people to read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

865
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:36,348
this assuming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all be written</font>

866
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,899
up is it there are a lot of things we

867
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:40,819
wanted to do when thinking about Joe

868
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:43,130
that we didn't do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was so</font>

869
01:00:40,819 --> 01:00:46,190
much resistance to any sort of hair

870
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:47,990
change of any sort and the fear was that

871
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:50,089
it would cause all the ripple effects in

872
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:52,910
the market I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> Donna pointed out there</font>

873
01:00:50,089 --> 01:00:55,069
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> no silicon chips supporting it the</font>

874
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:56,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">custom chips that were designed to do so</font>

875
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:59,779
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe we're known for shipping and</font>

876
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the resistance to doing that isn't</font>

877
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">really what it was before and so if</font>

878
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:05,480
there really is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason yeah my</font>

879
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,750
point is is it this might be worth

880
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:10,880
looking into the situation has changed

881
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:13,940
right and I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the final</font>

882
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:17,150
question remark are you intending this

883
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:19,849
for software implementation because at

884
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:24,170
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> time the speeds can do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

885
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:26,990
intending it for some of the trail

886
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:34,210
labels<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine green labels to be put in</font>

887
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:38,000
hardware if you know at this point and

888
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:40,369
excuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> me Kenyan will feet will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

889
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,260
hardware implementation that does

890
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:44,180
hardware forwarding or will it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

891
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:46,849
software implementation that does

892
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:50,210
boarding by the Trillia fine grading

893
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:55,190
label these are hardware and already

894
01:01:50,210 --> 01:02:01,339
many monitors so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me repeat that</font>

895
01:01:55,190 --> 01:02:03,170
hardware is your intent and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

896
01:02:01,339 --> 01:02:07,250
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that's also very good</font>

897
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:12,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">information thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you for putting up</font>

898
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:14,990
with the remote in speaker you'd be good

899
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:17,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give us feedback to the chairs how</font>

900
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:20,839
that worked thank you yeah thank you

901
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:22,880
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you for giving a bit</font>

902
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:25,279
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early in the morning if I got it</font>

903
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,609
right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> at five thirty in the morning</font>

904
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:33,190
or is it six o'clock it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> dope dude we</font>

905
01:02:28,609 --> 01:02:40,339
on me<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right it's what we're wearing</font>

906
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:41,900
I'm 53 am yeah wow you look very fresh

907
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:46,369
and alert so if they I did

908
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:52,809
wonderfully<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 253 am in 230 wow that's</font>

909
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:52,809
dedication thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so much</font>

910
01:02:53,859 --> 01:03:02,109
Donald I believe you have another thing

911
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:04,549
that goes on the same topic yeah

912
01:03:02,109 --> 01:03:06,799
originally I was going to propose a some

913
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:09,019
a different way of doing this fine green

914
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:12,019
label thing but I turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> my look at</font>

915
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:14,209
it it didn't work so<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then knock that</font>

916
01:03:12,019 --> 01:03:16,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's plenty of a few slides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on does it</font>

917
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:24,650
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> background and backwards</font>

918
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:27,619
compatibility stuff next slide I have

919
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:29,200
approval<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you know the purpose of</font>

920
01:03:27,619 --> 01:03:33,469
fine-grained labeling is to provide a

921
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:37,308
24-bit label I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 and ID when you</font>

922
01:03:33,469 --> 01:03:39,440
need more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,000 vlans because</font>

923
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:46,390
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that your classes of</font>

924
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:46,390
traffic to their food separate and the

925
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:58,060
it's me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the all your</font>

926
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:59,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">chopper to the via the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basic the VLAN on</font>

927
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:02,080
the native traffic if you configured it

928
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:04,150
this way gets mapped into an FGL at the

929
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,069
ingress our bridge and then the egress

930
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:09,370
it gets mapped back I guess the mappings

931
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:13,270
can be different and it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> prides</font>

932
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:15,130
away where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can have the purdy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us set</font>

933
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the traffic which is different from</font>

934
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:21,490
that externally and can be restored I

935
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:24,190
mean don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I push them spoken yeah</font>

936
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:26,020
bushnell<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah priority of yellow</font>

937
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:27,880
okay so this is what it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

938
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">very similar to the previous diagram and</font>

939
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:33,220
you might wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> how this strange double</font>

940
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:36,580
ethertype thing came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it sort of</font>

941
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:38,859
comes from the ethernet from the tag

942
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:40,870
stacking stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if you go back far</font>

943
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:44,050
enough a certain large commercial vendor

944
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:46,509
started putting to customer VLAN tags in

945
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:49,510
a row to<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicate essentially a 24-bit</font>

946
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:51,730
label and which that was never<font color="#E5E5E5"> approved</font>

947
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:54,610
as the standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any standards body</font>

948
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:56,200
and in fact what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Triple E did is day</font>

949
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:58,960
later said you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a service</font>

950
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:01,210
VLAN followed by a customer VLAN if you

951
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,740
want to effectively get that because

952
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:05,350
they thought putting two copies of the

953
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:07,990
same tag in the row was<font color="#E5E5E5"> evil or</font>

954
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:09,370
pertaining to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick it certainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was it</font>

955
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:11,799
was never standardized that it never

956
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:15,609
approved so not certainly wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> kosher</font>

957
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:19,960
so anyway uh but so we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wanted to</font>

958
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:21,400
do something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't</font>

959
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,870
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there was a liaison or</font>

960
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,020
anything but basically we were basically

961
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:29,680
told anything we wanted to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

962
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:31,900
customer or service VLAN tags my<font color="#E5E5E5"> tripoli</font>

963
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,730
had to exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow I Tripoli rules we</font>

964
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:36,010
couldn't do anything different so we

965
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:37,390
said well we'll get our own either type

966
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:39,400
and then we can say what the rules are

967
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:43,120
so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a roni to type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrea</font>

968
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:45,460
simply did what is commonly called tag

969
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:50,770
stacking but with our own<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV but that's</font>

970
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:55,450
how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ended up that way so one of the</font>

971
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:58,480
things is let's assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a draft ins</font>

972
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:59,779
the standardization of the proposal that

973
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,610
Goomer has presented

974
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:05,300
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a problem you might have a</font>

975
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:07,100
link with<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ports on it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

976
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:09,140
different our bridges that use different

977
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:11,810
FGL encodings and that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

978
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:13,160
work very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so does the one of the</font>

979
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:17,860
details<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clean up</font>

980
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:21,950
to do this is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a bit in the</font>

981
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:23,060
capabilities of the either in the port

982
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:25,879
game abilities or the switch

983
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:29,840
capabilities indicating which variation

984
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:31,130
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using and if you guys are all</font>

985
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same on the link</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is</font>

986
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:35,060
wonderful you might it might be better

987
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:37,160
be purport if there could ever be

988
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:39,230
something you could convert from one to

989
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,700
the other or you could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it /</font>

990
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:45,380
switched if you want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be simpler</font>

991
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:48,140
and if you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> do get and which is on</font>

992
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:50,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same link then you really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't send</font>

993
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:56,690
FGL traffic because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will the other</font>

994
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:58,400
end won't understand it if if the FGL is

995
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:00,950
you know you could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a court that</font>

996
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,200
understood both the existing format and

997
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,580
acquittals and the new one but if you

998
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,919
have two ones that are fundamentally

999
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:08,660
incompatible probably the safest thing

1000
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,430
to do is just not establish an adjacency

1001
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:14,049
on that link and this should be a very

1002
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:17,180
rare situation would only be case where

1003
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:18,980
the network is perhaps not that well

1004
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,569
managed and a well managed network a lot

1005
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:22,460
of these in compatibility problems

1006
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:25,460
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very rare nevertheless for</font>

1007
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:26,900
safety and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't send</font>

1008
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,310
something to the wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten enter the</font>

1009
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:31,130
wrong VLAN and violate security

1010
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:32,600
requirements you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to indicate the</font>

1011
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:36,470
format you're using and you need to

1012
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:38,650
check for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this into that ability so</font>

1013
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:48,410
that's really all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just add</font>

1014
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:53,720
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions ok we'll go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

1015
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:56,629
set asides Donald what was your intent

1016
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:59,350
was to just work this out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

1017
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:59,350
previous one

1018
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:10,160
so yeah I whoever has<font color="#E5E5E5"> chuckling before</font>

1019
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:14,750
and Mar both our names on the Venus

1020
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:17,269
draft so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Buddhist slides so the next</font>

1021
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:19,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">step would be to produce a draft so I</font>

1022
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:21,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it should obviously a first draft</font>

1023
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,970
doesn't have to cover everything but

1024
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:25,609
it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for it to at least mention</font>

1025
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:30,020
all the issues and have a sketch of a

1026
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:32,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution to any of them Thank You Donald</font>

1027
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:37,310
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go on to the next thing</font>

1028
01:08:32,839 --> 01:08:40,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">on our agenda which is the parents</font>

1029
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">election are you is route from a Kumar</font>

1030
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:46,040
good you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> here wonderful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in person let</font>

1031
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:49,160
me see if I can get these slides up

1032
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:52,519
please take the once i get your slides

1033
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:58,040
it will be just easily and thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1034
01:08:52,520 --> 01:09:01,640
redoing the slides for us he gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a</font>

1035

moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to the right screen does</font>

1036
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:08,270
this look good<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right one</font>

1037
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:11,030
yeah ok here we go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just tell</font>

1038
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:13,730
me when you want to change the sides<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1039
01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:15,889
so I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case for this</font>

1040
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:18,229
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft which solves a known</font>

1041
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:22,670
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> in trouble my name is aunt</font>

1042
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:24,410
Miranda both of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> communications so</font>

1043
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:26,120
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem that the draft a</font>

1044
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">scientist out it's basically that the</font>

1045
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,620
parent default pattern selection rules

1046
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:32,570
standardized in the treadle

1047
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:34,160
reconstruction process can lead to

1048
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:37,029
situations where parents for a

1049
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:40,870
particular node in the tree shift

1050
01:09:37,029 --> 01:09:42,830
unnecessarily and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

1051
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:46,399
creating problems for customers in the

1052
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:48,019
field<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the draft here basically tries</font>

1053
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:49,969
to provides actually two different

1054
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:52,580
solutions which can be used for this and

1055
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:58,180
I will explain what they are and which

1056
01:09:52,580 --> 01:10:00,980
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is preferred as I go along so the</font>

1057
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:02,540
crux of it comes down to this basically

1058
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:05,000
the second pilot the lower paragraph on

1059
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:07,610
the page ok so if and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll skip one</font>

1060
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,070
slide mode so it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to this so</font>

1061
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:13,339
basically if you are building<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 number J</font>

1062
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:15,730
and you have a situation where a node

1063
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:17,650
can be pulled by three different parents

1064
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:21,160
then the virtual chooses the parent for

1065
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:22,989
that particular tree is it use it orders

1066
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:28,120
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parents in ascending order of</font>

1067
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:30,280
seven octave is is ID and then in dec

1068
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:32,230
sets them up so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first one has</font>

1069
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:35,769
an index of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 the last one has an index</font>

1070
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:38,019
of and not P minus 1 or whatever it is

1071
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:40,300
and then the parent choice is then made

1072
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:41,530
as J minus one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> p where j is the</font>

1073
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:44,710
tree number and p is the number of

1074
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:47,290
parents so what does what problem does

1075
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:49,300
this cause so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a let's take</font>

1076
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:51,390
the example of this spine<font color="#CCCCCC"> lift network</font>

1077
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:53,800
that's shown on the right side here are

1078
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:55,989
basically let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this we are</font>

1079
01:10:53,800 --> 01:11:00,520
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree number two and that</font>

1080
01:10:55,989 --> 01:11:02,709
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the root node for that tree you start</font>

1081
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,780
off the SPF at eight and then it tries

1082
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:07,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead it tries to pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the nodes</font>

1083
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:08,410
that are optimally reachable from it so

1084
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:09,969
on the very first shot is going to pull

1085
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:12,030
in one two and three because those are

1086
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:14,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the nearest nodes that are attached</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

1087
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:16,389
so and four<font color="#E5E5E5"> one two and three there is</font>

1088
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:18,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">no choice of parent because it is the</font>

1089
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:22,210
tree root is a and only a can be the

1090
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:23,710
parent now as the second step<font color="#E5E5E5"> none will</font>

1091
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:25,840
start looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at other nodes which are</font>

1092
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:28,660
reachable through one two<font color="#E5E5E5"> and three and</font>

1093
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:32,290
now you will find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can now reach</font>

1094
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:34,720
B and C now when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to pull in B</font>

1095
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:36,580
and C into the tree you have a choice

1096
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:40,390
they can be pulling through one through

1097
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:42,220
two or three so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rule</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1098
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:43,630
rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was on the previous slide is</font>

1099
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:48,130
basically acting as a tiebreaker for

1100
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:49,690
this particular situation so in this

1101
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:52,180
case what you will do is you so let's

1102
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:54,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">say they in ascending order of I sighs</font>

1103
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:56,860
ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parents are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one two and</font>

1104
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:58,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">three okay so one is considered to be</font>

1105
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:00,370
our index<font color="#E5E5E5"> 02 is considered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get index</font>

1106
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:04,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">one and three is considered to be at</font>

1107
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:06,340
index 2 so because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is 32 and you</font>

1108
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:08,259
have three<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents potential parents you</font>

1109
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:11,950
will compute the index the preferred

1110
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:14,500
index as 2-1 mod 3 which is equal to 1

1111
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:16,630
mod 3 which is equal to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 so you will go</font>

1112
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,220
with so the node at index 1 will

1113
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:19,930
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> too if you see the list there</font>

1114
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:22,360
right so too will become<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parent for</font>

1115
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:27,040
gay and see so the tree looks as it does

1116
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:28,870
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left side arm so this is fine but</font>

1117
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:32,080
what happens when let

1118
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:33,370
node number one went down so again

1119
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,470
you're forced to recalculate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

1120
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:37,900
at that point at that point what happens

1121
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:39,430
is a pulls in two and three directly now

1122
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,440
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come when you're pulling</font>

1123
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:42,700
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> B and C you have a choice they can be</font>

1124
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,400
pulling through<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or they can be</font>

1125
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:47,139
pulling through three so again order the

1126
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,629
parents in ascending order so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are 2</font>

1127
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:50,710
is at index<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 threes our index 1 you run</font>

1128
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:52,390
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the calculation which is</font>

1129
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:54,490
basically three number minus 1 mod

1130
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:57,670
number of parents which is in this case

1131
01:12:54,490 --> 01:13:00,309
2 minus 1 mod two parents now so is

1132
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:02,560
equal to 1 mod 2 which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one however</font>

1133
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:06,910
the node at index 1 is actually is node

1134
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:08,560
3 now so in the updated list so now what

1135
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:11,019
happens is the parents were BNC shift

1136
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,480
from two to three ok so this causes a

1137
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:14,890
lot of issues in real in real networks

1138
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:18,209
because basically you have running

1139
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:20,430
traffic that can get disrupted and the

1140
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:23,710
there was a real customer case where

1141
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:25,210
there's some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> financial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / that's</font>

1142
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:29,350
one or somebody was looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to</font>

1143
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:31,780
solve this so that that basically led up

1144
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:32,800
to this and there are that as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1145
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:35,200
can tell there are two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve</font>

1146
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,030
this i will talk about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bogie</font>

1147
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,670
approaches and<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i prefer one of them</font>

1148
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:41,950
so the simplest easiest way to solve

1149
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:43,840
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is using the affinity sub here it's</font>

1150
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:45,910
a sub theory of the router capability

1151
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:50,020
tlv which is already<font color="#E5E5E5"> used in many other</font>

1152
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:52,150
scenario culture and it's published by

1153
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:54,280
the so in terms of semantics is

1154
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:58,480
published by the planet identifying

1155
01:13:54,280 --> 01:14:00,969
which children it wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a parent</font>

1156
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:03,429
relationship with and the specific tree

1157
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:05,320
on which this is to be done it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1158
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:08,860
quite powerful and needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used with</font>

1159
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:10,330
certain caveat so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the approach</font>

1160
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:12,070
one works is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operated</font>

1161
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:13,570
configures<font color="#E5E5E5"> parent stickiness on a</font>

1162
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,099
particular preferred mode so in the

1163
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:17,590
previous example if you go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1164
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,300
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on unknown number two he can</font>

1165
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:21,400
he can configure this parents tequila

1166
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,930
saying that my preferred parent in all

1167
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:28,150
three situations is to for that

1168
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:30,580
particular level in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tree so once</font>

1169
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:33,099
once he configures this what happens is

1170
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:35,740
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two then runs through a</font>

1171
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:37,240
tree calculation again when it runs

1172
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:39,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the tree calculation it does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1173
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:41,800
use the default reviews and at the same

1174
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,699
time at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point it has not published</font>

1175
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:46,150
any affinity

1176
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:48,999
but ignores its own any affinity tells

1177
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:50,888
me that it might have generated but it

1178
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:54,670
because it has now a preferred parent

1179
01:14:50,889 --> 01:14:56,709
skaters it acquires the so when you're

1180
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:58,239
in the SPF construction you see that you

1181
01:14:56,709 --> 01:15:00,459
are in contention to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a parent for</font>

1182
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:03,039
those children and you it asserts that

1183
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:06,130
parent relationship basically so

1184
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:09,329
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> bill pools DNC in the</font>

1185
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:13,420
previous case through through itself and

1186
01:15:09,329 --> 01:15:15,280
and it becomes the parent of BNC now

1187
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:18,249
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has run through one calculation</font>

1188
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,869
and and it through it has waited for

1189
01:15:18,249 --> 01:15:22,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">some measure of stability let's say a</font>

1190
01:15:19,869 --> 01:15:23,679
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> check a certain time interval or</font>

1191
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:25,659
something like that then it goes ahead

1192
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,309
and publishes and affinities of jail<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1193
01:15:25,659 --> 01:15:29,679
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hey i am the preferred</font>

1194
01:15:27,309 --> 01:15:32,619
method for children B and C on three

1195
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:35,019
number two so once this goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in the</font>

1196
01:15:32,619 --> 01:15:36,610
network everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows that too wants</font>

1197
01:15:35,019 --> 01:15:38,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to assert that current relationship and</font>

1198
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:41,170
they all bind it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two as the parent</font>

1199
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so subsequently what happens so if</font>

1200
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:44,920
you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same situation in the</font>

1201
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:47,650
previous the did this approach one

1202
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:51,820
scheme implemented what happens is that

1203
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:53,920
when one goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> down you are even before</font>

1204
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:56,949
one went down presumably when two was

1205
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,449
configured with the parent stickiness it

1206
01:15:56,949 --> 01:16:00,459
went ahead and published an affinity sub

1207
01:15:58,449 --> 01:16:02,530
tlv which went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> every node in the</font>

1208
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:04,329
network so even when one went down

1209
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:06,309
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> is using the default trail</font>

1210
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:08,049
calculation anymore they already know

1211
01:16:06,309 --> 01:16:10,869
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> two wants to be the parent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1212
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:13,420
it has sent its affinity<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kelby and it</font>

1213
01:16:10,869 --> 01:16:15,639
which is valid right now so everybody

1214
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:18,039
will pick you as a preferred parent so

1215
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:19,479
the parent will not shift 23 when one

1216
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:22,150
goes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically which is what you</font>

1217
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:23,469
wanted to achieve so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second</font>

1218
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:25,089
way in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this this</font>

1219
01:16:23,469 --> 01:16:29,320
approach is a little bit harder to

1220
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:33,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement arm and so the way its</font>

1221
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:34,539
proposed is that so the draft presents

1222
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:37,389
are modified form on the Dijkstra

1223
01:16:34,539 --> 01:16:39,579
algorithm where basically you are you

1224
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:42,340
are if multiple parents can pull in a

1225
01:16:39,579 --> 01:16:45,308
particular child at the same optimal

1226
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:47,670
cost then you can insert<font color="#E5E5E5"> a policy filter</font>

1227
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:50,110
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the free construction thing what</font>

1228
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:52,479
which will drive your parents election

1229
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:55,209
basically the policy filter is abstract

1230
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:56,489
you can put whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can hold it</font>

1231
01:16:55,209 --> 01:16:58,829
however you want

1232
01:16:56,489 --> 01:17:00,299
but the what the draft cops about is

1233
01:16:58,829 --> 01:17:03,119
that you make it match your previous

1234
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:05,309
stable pre-construction<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you can</font>

1235
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">begin with let's say you started off</font>

1236
01:17:05,309 --> 01:17:09,840
with till the default rule rules and

1237
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:13,980
your tree look like like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it did on the</font>

1238
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:15,809
left side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide gear so once you</font>

1239
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,459
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> too was the parent in</font>

1240
01:17:15,809 --> 01:17:19,409
subsequent recalculations you will

1241
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:21,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">continue to be maintained</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to as the</font>

1242
01:17:19,409 --> 01:17:23,638
parent because you are poly because your

1243
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:28,909
policy is always referencing the

1244
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:31,559
previous table draft reconstruction so

1245
01:17:28,909 --> 01:17:32,999
so by doing this you basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> preserve</font>

1246
01:17:31,559 --> 01:17:37,380
whoever was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parent when the first</font>

1247
01:17:32,999 --> 01:17:38,760
drill parents election was applied so

1248
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:40,559
this will also solve the problem but

1249
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:42,809
basically here the difficulty<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

1250
01:17:40,559 --> 01:17:46,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach is that you have to you have to</font>

1251
01:17:42,809 --> 01:17:47,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind you're kind of doing the doing a</font>

1252
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:50,070
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time synchronization in a</font>

1253
01:17:47,519 --> 01:17:53,489
distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network basically so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1254
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:55,380
harder to do and with some caveats it

1255
01:17:53,489 --> 01:17:58,190
might work but it's probably best suited

1256
01:17:55,380 --> 01:18:00,599
for like small to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid-size networks but</font>

1257
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:02,730
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide indicates how that works</font>

1258
01:18:00,599 --> 01:18:04,139
so when one went down because<font color="#CCCCCC"> too was</font>

1259
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:05,610
the preferred parent you continue to

1260
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:08,659
latch<font color="#CCCCCC"> 22 in your subsequent</font>

1261
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:11,989
recalculations you policy guides that

1262
01:18:08,659 --> 01:18:14,638
but still between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two approaches</font>

1263
01:18:11,989 --> 01:18:19,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach one is substantially better</font>

1264
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:20,849
preferred arm and because it's

1265
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:22,860
guaranteed to work everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

1266
01:18:20,849 --> 01:18:24,269
need to implement approach a is already

1267
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:28,889
there in trill and no change to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1268
01:18:24,269 --> 01:18:30,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol is needed but I still put</font>

1269
01:18:28,889 --> 01:18:31,650
approach be there as a backup just in

1270
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:34,199
case you know something prevents

1272
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:38,900
there's no there's no I pier on either

1273
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:42,389
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> approaches that okay so</font>

1274
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:44,489
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm requesting that this gear</font>

1275
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:46,260
adopted as a working group document

1276
01:18:44,489 --> 01:18:49,919
because it solves a reasonably important

1277
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:50,999
problem in true arm however there are in

1278
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,769
the published version there are a few

1279
01:18:50,999 --> 01:18:55,079
mistakes and logical inconsistency that

1280
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:56,670
I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix I have a private draft</font>

1281
01:18:55,079 --> 01:19:00,570
which I will probably upload after the

1282
01:18:56,670 --> 01:19:02,820
after I the current idea on one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1283
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:04,110
questions I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> was you know should we</font>

1284
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:06,179
carry approach be all the way till<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1285
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:09,780
end or just remove it and knew that

1286
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:12,139
approach a arm

1287
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:14,699
the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the policy driven up</font>

1288
01:19:12,139 --> 01:19:16,079
mechanism listed in approach be can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1289
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:18,419
used in some other situations

1290
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:21,329
particularly if you want some there can

1291
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:23,070
be alternative default parents election

1292
01:19:21,329 --> 01:19:24,690
groups it so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably come up</font>

1293
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:27,179
with other formulas which will try to do

1294
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:29,250
a better job of distributing the links

1295
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:31,500
on between the parents the children

1296
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:33,090
between the parents basically if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1297
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">is any approaching interest in pursuing</font>

1298
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:36,619
that maybe we could probably use

1299
01:19:34,829 --> 01:19:39,599
approach we as a separate draft and

1300
01:19:36,619 --> 01:19:41,280
approach a can be enhanced to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> node</font>

1301
01:19:39,599 --> 01:19:44,460
redundancy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that sticky for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1302
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:45,989
preferred parent basically so one one

1303
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">other question I had was the draft is</font>

1304
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:50,218
currently informational sorry

1305
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:55,589

1306
01:19:50,219 --> 01:20:01,590
changed or informational so so that's

1307
01:19:55,590 --> 01:20:04,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it so just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I may be behind</font>

1308
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:09,539
in the draft and the draft changes the

1309
01:20:04,949 --> 01:20:13,320
affinity tell me that you're proposing

1310
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:16,579
is that a new version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a penalty kill</font>

1311
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:20,630
me than I missed or is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original</font>

1313
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:28,710

1314
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:33,169
this an application or since we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mechanism for changing parents election</font>

1317
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:43,709
in other words we're using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

1319
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:51,869
changing the paragraphs in RFC 7780 is

1320
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:53,519
that what i understand correctly no it's

1321
01:20:51,869 --> 01:20:55,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a blinding the same affinity</font>

1323
01:20:55,889 --> 01:21:00,690
in the new situation it's not really

1324
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:08,219
changing it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I changing</font>

1325
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:11,848
anything ok ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's it sounds like an</font>

01:21:08,219 --> 01:21:13,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">informational I'm sorry if it you know</font>

1327
01:21:11,849 --> 01:21:16,619
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing anything it's an</font>

1328
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:19,678
informational good idea on how to

1329
01:21:16,619 --> 01:21:21,539
prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers from flapping but</font>

1330
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,200
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not changing anything in the</font>

in the dress

1332
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,790
sounds like if you've got customers that

1333
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:34,460
have problems this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real important</font>

1334
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:37,830
thing to look at and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know i would</font>

1335
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:41,310
state those things to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list and</font>

1336
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:43,130
indicate the problem you know underline

1337
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:45,840
the problems you're having with

1338
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:49,320
customers so that we can consider that

1339
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:53,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the process of adoption it sounds</font>

1340
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:55,440
like the custom are you having lots of

1341
01:21:53,040 --> 01:22:00,300
customers a few customers and this is an

1342

supports full directory information

1378
01:23:56,690 --> 01:24:04,669
because how to do push was unclear and

1379

the this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sade stuff in there which</font>
