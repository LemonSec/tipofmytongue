detection strategy and also windows

75
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:32,829
strategy and the entree one and the

76
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,290
second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a TD HTTP status code</font>

our web pages and<font color="#E5E5E5"> here it's some basic</font>

84
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,250
strategy of aqua on the windows and

85
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:10,930
Android and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one is all across</font>

somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nova faces like Captain</font>

Oh calm and to check the internet

89
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,350
connectivity and if they get the tickets

<font color="#E5E5E5">the success there is free internet</font>

91
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,380
connection but the if other if they get

92
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,510
the other response on it is regarded as

93
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,930
a captive portal and the second one is a

94
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:35,020
windows and the windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a two steps</font>

95
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:38,310
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> check the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> captive portal and the one</font>

96
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:43,329
is they send a DNS lookup glee cast for

97
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:46,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the domain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the they check the</font>

98
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:50,650
weather they get a collect IP address

99
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,480
the one and the like and the second one

100
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:58,720
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the they also arm access that will</font>

101
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:02,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both basic and whether they can get</font>

102
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that correct a case or not and so on it</font>

103
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:09,339
android strategy and they have also

104
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:14,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">already waited for HTTP poop and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> https</font>

105
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:21,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">loop and the arm Doug web page is just</font>

106
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:24,219
on the sponsor 204 and not content so if

107
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,620
they get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> that list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bones there is</font>

108
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,260
for internet connectivity but if they

109
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:32,530
cannot get that the spouse on there are

110
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:37,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">very in behind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up kappa photo the next</font>

111
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:40,870
slide please and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so first one it</font>

112
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:45,730
falls negative so Mac OS and iOS the

113
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:49,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">strategy and um for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this strategy oh I</font>

114
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:51,310
can I could detect them about ninety

115
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,340
percent of captive water but less than

116
00:14:51,310 --> 00:15:04,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten percent on the strategy could not</font>

117
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:06,910
detect the snakes which breeds so next

118
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:13,780
one is false negative so windows

119
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:17,980
strategy and as i said as i explained in

120
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:21,540
the previous slides on windows strategy

121
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:26,380
has a two steps to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> capital photo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

122
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:28,870
this is the result and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the about Oh</font>

123
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,960
about ten percent of captive portal on

124
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:34,540
defeat of window detection strategy so

125
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,000
not so many but the window strategy also

126
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:41,290
cannot all of the top captive order in

127
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,510
tokyo<font color="#CCCCCC"> in japan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next track please so</font>

128
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,939
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is most</font>

129
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,370
interesting information for you and this

130
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:52,690
is false negatives for android in the

131
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:55,840
strategy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one it's the glass</font>

and arm moreover on some of them also um

berry pie and though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said some some</font>

200
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,940
user agent but not extra not<font color="#E5E5E5"> contacted</font>

00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:57,549
on actual

202

android but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I you so you reverse</font>

203
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:03,158
engineer implementation then you ran it

204
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,309
well I see I so you try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

205
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:09,159
what our code does and then you ran it

206
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:15,418
yes yes but I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah and I</font>

208
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:22,600
use my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nexus and the test date also my</font>

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:28,090
actual device and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they cannot</font>

210
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:29,980
detect oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so i think the assertion</font>

211
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,928
here is that this particular network

212
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,450
service provider is spoofing the two are

213
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:37,350
for not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 and so they're producing</font>

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:43,980
the same response that your servicer

country i asked the that name for such

220
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:02,830
vibrant i asked the technical manager of

221

get answer yet but um this is my

223
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,870
prediction but like originally the

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:14,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">captain photodetection is deployed for</font>

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,049
some some trouble with logging pulses or

API and the users complain about a

231
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:36,220
detection is one of the lesson or

232
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:40,320
something worship wider want to get some

258
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:15,500
proposal is a writing captive water

259
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,429
Survey ID will be variable output for us

260

00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:24,530
Japan but the connected to further

262
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:27,799
survey like in other country that's aah

observed fighters not only oil spenders

278

<font color="#CCCCCC">that the Android code is changing all</font>

290
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:54,649
the time and it right now it does more

291
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,050
than two more than two checks and we

292
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,150
change the hostname various times so one

293
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,680
thing one thing with the would be great

294
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,720
is it you know if you need an actual

295
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,030
Android device mm-hmm you know i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

296
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,430
give you one and so you can actually run

297
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:10,690
the code on a real device because it it

298
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:14,350
um those two probes are very different

299
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:19,010
also part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this one is to</font>

300
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:20,500
is to ensure that that the user even if

301
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,910
the captive portal is not cooperating

302
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:27,050
that the user still keeps working

303
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,700
internet access and so doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL is kind</font>

304
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:32,030
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seventy-six percent is kind of</font>

305
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,010
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal of that one uh-huh so um</font>

306
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,780
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

307
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">with these people and if you know who</font>

308
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,810
they are um I'm happy to chat with them

309
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,810
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you know the Japanese</font>

310
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:47,000
ones who think they can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them</font>

311
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:49,490
thank you so yeah so do you want an

312
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,140
android device like can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is actual</font>

313
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:56,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware because I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

314
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:58,910
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more useful mm-hmm it or or you can</font>

315
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,340
actually reimplement the real code that

316
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,530
we have because I you can read that code

317
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,820
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do two things it</font>

318
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,710
does the ending now and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

319
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,020
staggered timer and then if it doesn't

320
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:12,610
do if the ssl probe doesn't succeed it

321
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:15,560
decides<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some other thing right so</font>

322
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:20,800
yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know or we can work</font>

323
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:24,500
together on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and um 400 our</font>

324
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,139
detection strategy um I saw some chords

325
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:32,330
like oh can I go to

326
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:34,880
16-piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes a 16 16 page yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one</font>

327
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:38,689
and uh are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there some google earth on</font>

328
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,710
let um give me that links like I think

329
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:45,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">network monitor to jabber</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like something</font>

330
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:47,330
but i'm not i'm not sure that i guess

331
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:50,330
that's a red car it's not the newest

332
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:52,669
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's not so sorry no that</font>

333
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,679
is the right link I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good but</font>

334
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,110
what you described in your earlier slide

335
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,420
is not what the code does for a few

336
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:06,229
months now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually it's um</font>

337
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:09,860
like too confusing to UM catch up all of

338
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:15,920
things so I make yeah I make cut cut off

339
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:17,389
some of bings life Tommy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kali Apple so</font>

340
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,090
first of all thank you so much for doing

341
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,200
this this is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be great work</font>

342
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:25,610
to have a survey i think you should

343
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,710
engage in you doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of these right</font>

344
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">i mean using real devices is great but i</font>

345
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,700
think we could also just be make sure

346
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,260
that the vendors are open with what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

347
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,210
current probes are so that we can i

348
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,620
think is a cool idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have just a</font>

349
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,110
device i can go around just try<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

350
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,949
them at the same time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

351
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:44,780
network advanced really cool approach i

352
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:47,870
do want to mention one thing if people

353
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:51,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to test this there is an API that</font>

354
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:53,840
we have run<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS devices called hotspot</font>

355
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,189
helper which allows people who have

356
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,370
their own captive portal authentication

357
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,740
to head of interpose themselves during

358
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association phase and be part of the</font>

359
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,610
probing so you could simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a</font>

360
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,560
research version of that that does a

361
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,090
series of probes to kind of analyze this

362
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,530
captive portals as we're first

363
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,179
connecting to a Wi-Fi and just see what

364
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,379
that's like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just if you want</font>

365
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,960
fighters on that we could point to that

366
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,630
and I like you ask you about like is

367
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,810
there any different point between the

368
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:24,440
iOS strategy or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strategies like</font>

369
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">macbook render I'm not not phenomenally</font>

370
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,330
the same strategy Oh from from what

371
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:35,000
network probes are done<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

372
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:36,649
Alex<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roscoe comcast um from my</font>

373
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,950
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think ripe Atlas probes</font>

374
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,940
are adding Wi-Fi to to the probe and it

375
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,370
may be interesting to open up the

376
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,490
sessions with them to see if you can do

377
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:49,580
measurements from their probes checking

378
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,290
some of these these metrics but yeah

379
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,960
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll poke is that be you get like</font>

380
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:59,629
a global vision of that possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

381
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:02,630
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Rick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Taylor a bus um I really</font>

382
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all round and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff my</font>

383
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,820
question is a follow-on is what affects

384
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,520
me with what I'm trying to do at the

385
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,409
moment is you discover the captive

386
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,470
portal you log into the captive portal

387
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:17,300
I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see the survey record what</font>

388
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,860
the captive portal is monitoring and

389
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,139
what Howard is building this association

390
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,780
is it just IP address is it Mac because

391
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,780
I've come across spectacles of both and

392
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,820
so if we're building a universal test

393
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,340
suite or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trying to be universal test</font>

394
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using all the Android or the Apple</font>

395
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,500
approaches that's great but can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also</font>

396
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,510
try and record what the captive portal

397
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:44,600
is is remembering about the session

398
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:48,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">familien purposes I hear and volunteer</font>

399
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:55,010
to contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the code quite possibly</font>

400
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:58,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">great we are here um don't have any way</font>

401
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:00,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get this automatically but well we</font>

402
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:03,920
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the recipes are</font>

403
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:07,879
actively defeating the captive portal

404
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,500
detection and and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have lots of</font>

405
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,350
speculation do you have any knowledge of

406
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:15,650
why they do this these things any

407
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:19,990
concrete statements for them why did why

408
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,990
they're doing it it's

409
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,340
I have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of speculation at this</font>

410
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,129
point I've got a lot of but several

411
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,379
ideas myself and I think what had well

412
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,450
no I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these these ideas</font>

413
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:37,399
confirmed but but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many reasons</font>

414
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:39,230
I think from what I've learned David's

415
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:41,689
kanazawa to jumping in<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly answer</font>

416
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:44,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">your question from what we've understood</font>

417
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:47,840
by talking to them a lot of them don't

418
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,149
like the UI that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors are and by</font>

419
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,399
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean the client devices show when</font>

420
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:54,799
we detect captive mortals so they

421
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,949
explicitly go out of their way to defeat

422
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">our probes to show their own UI by man</font>

423
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:04,909
in the middle lane while the HTTP

424
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:08,268
traffic mm-hmm hi um I'm only start

425
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:10,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google uh I just wanted to say this is</font>

426
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:13,340
very interesting I work on chrome and

427
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:15,230
Chrome also has its own um captive

428
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,480
portal detection that it is on platforms

429
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:21,260
did you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at all uh it is a</font>

430
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:25,880
clone new project yeah yeah i saw a good

431
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:28,250

this testing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chrome detection</font>

00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:34,429
logic also like um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:46,700
UM the<font color="#CCCCCC"> androids strategy and the chrome</font>

437
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:51,889
strategy is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same um I believe</font>

438
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:54,830
it's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deplane</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Larry yeah I</font>

439
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:57,049
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> emma is similar I think I think</font>

440
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,870
chrome does a probe to one of the URLs

441
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:01,700
that Android test when the the code is

442
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,860
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mm pretty sure they</font>

443
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,990
diverge I'd be um I can give you a

444
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:10,129
pointer to the chrome code offline and

445
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:14,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll be helpful so yeah so yeah I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Rico this is very interesting work you</font>

449
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,309
mentioned ideas about and extending your

<font color="#E5E5E5">savvy into other locations I'll get any</font>

451
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:32,149
thoughts about how to go about that are

452
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,440
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for volunteers or as a web</font>

453

page but people get copper to the

454
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,460
software the hobby

455
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,260
decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> for themselves or is that still</font>

456
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,390
something that stillness it of the

457
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:45,160
North can give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> some ideas about what</font>

458
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:53,799
you want to do next<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I see my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name is</font>

459
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:57,910
Jim redo the start Jim oh and actually

460
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:59,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay can I yeah what are your plans that</font>

461
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:02,230
you said you wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to extend the survey</font>

462
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,309
for surfer deserving I don't have any

463
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,919
thoughts about how you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> go about</font>

464
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:09,340
that or you have for volunteers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

465
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,790
uh might pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> em observe first of its on</font>

466
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:15,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most biggest point is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

467
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:19,780
be about other countries and the other

468
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:25,179
one is I want to include more cervical

469
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:30,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">taste like um like to see it give me</font>

470
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:34,390
like more surveillance for clone war so

471
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:36,490
if you have some survey um you like to

472
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:40,620
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on please let me know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

473
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:43,750
include more items okay thanks thank you

474
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:47,110
ok and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I'm channeling Christian</font>

475
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:49,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">Saunders</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at sure we are able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

476
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,340
browser cookies to pre-register devices

477
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:54,100
before they connect to our Wi-Fi network

478
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,500
we need the device browser not the cna

479
00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:04,270
browser in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recover the browser</font>

480
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:06,130
token Oh what is it sells I'm gonna get

481
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">out unless that's quick I just want to</font>

482
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:11,080
ask heard that to be repeated more

483
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,668
slowly oh it's in the Java room so so

484
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,909
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens here is that</font>

485
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:18,330
they use the real cookies from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from</font>

486
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:20,800
the browser to detect previous sessions

487
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,869
so it may be that you all voted like

488
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,840
fast let you on yet babe ass we're

489
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:31,770
packing they snoop on<font color="#CCCCCC"> new traffic from</font>

490
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:36,220
last time then yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of clever</font>

491
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:38,649
they're so so so cold thanks Perico no I

492
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:41,129
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we've largely done I mean</font>

493
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:44,469
yeah you<font color="#CCCCCC"> sat down we have one question I</font>

494
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:47,739
recorded does the survey cover mobile

495
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:48,428
devices I mean connection with mobile

496
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:51,489
network

497
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:55,300
a normal normal wear network or the only

498
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:59,348
public Wi-Fi network or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japan yes do you</font>

499
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:02,530
plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> to extend the survey to captive of</font>

500
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:07,839
that situation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the case of mobile</font>

501
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:11,079
connection like um I know so I don't

502
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">know so much about a deep water in</font>

503
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:17,020
mobile station so several of them which

504
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,078
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar with the use case you</font>

505
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:29,710
listen to bowser but it is not the same

506
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:32,319
as like that captive portal maybe you

507
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:36,010
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so that mix okay well I think</font>

508
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:41,319
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough on that subject and Kyle</font>

509
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:44,140
here has presentation on its draft which

510
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:47,410
we're all grateful pouring writing this

511
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:51,640
is aren't right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hi everyone I'm</font>

512
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:53,950
Kyle arose from San<font color="#E5E5E5"> vine and I'm here to</font>

513
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:59,859
talk about an architecture for captive

514
00:35:53,950 --> 00:36:01,270
portal interactions<font color="#CCCCCC"> X like um so I mean</font>

515
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:02,920
we're all here to learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> captive</font>

516
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,329
portal so we pretty much probably know

517
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,730
what you know how they work what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

518
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:10,540
problems are but a bit of a summary here

519
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:12,839
um so you know they the interfere with

520
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:17,410
normal traffic flow first establishing

521
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:21,270
your login or whatever they have a habit

522
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:25,029
of modifying HTTP wreaking havoc on

523
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:27,930
encrypted sessions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it</font>

524
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:32,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">just sort of lead to bad behavior um and</font>

525
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:34,540
I mean there's a draft describing this

526
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:36,520
problem so want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

527
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">just read that take you much better job</font>

528
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:45,640
of summarizing it and I probably ever

529
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:46,660
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> um next slide please so uh as we</font>

530
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,629
all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a working group about</font>

531
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:52,480
this and from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter basically</font>

532
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:55,480
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do a few things in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

533
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,720
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group and one was to you know</font>

534
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,059
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that devices have a can figure</font>

535
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,839
out what you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> I to go to to interact</font>

536
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:05,559
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the capital Port</font>

537
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,808
and you know the tech the captive portal

538
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:12,339
in a consistent manner<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm learned about</font>

539
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:14,829
it deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and you know even better</font>

540
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:17,859
if necessary to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it without any human</font>

541
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:18,999
interaction which enables abundant bunch

542
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:22,719
of use cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would otherwise be</font>

543
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:24,098
impossible and we had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

544
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:28,690
discussions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on the mailing</font>

545
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:30,609
list in meetings and so what me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Dave</font>

546
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,700
tried to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the architecture was</font>

547
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:35,200
condensed all that down into you know

548
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,509
one doctor that describe sort of how

549
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:42,218
<font color="#CCCCCC">that should all work together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

550
00:37:37,509 --> 00:37:43,719
likely so you know again the main goals

551
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:46,420
of the architecture is to provide a

552
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:49,119
standard way to employing capital

553
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:51,819
portals or you know set of ways maybe

554
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,029
maybe there's a few pieces that could

555
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:57,489
bury or you know work one without the

556
00:37:55,029 --> 00:38:00,599
others but key point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

557
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:04,839
few components that have a well-defined

558
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:06,789
set of behavior and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> architecture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

559
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:08,380
calling those outs and trying to say

560
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:14,249
what's net what you need to do and what

561
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:17,259
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> opt tionally um next slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

562
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:21,879
so there's the architecture uh it's

563
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:23,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">there me maybe the text diagram that I</font>

564
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,930
had in the the draft was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually better</font>

565
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,410
than this but I tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

566
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,269
little more readable here sort of draw

567
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:33,489
the four main components there that are

568
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:34,959
all interacting and in the further to

569
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:37,479
fall on slides I'll discuss a bit more

570
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,839
what they do but essentially the arrows

571
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:44,799
show the flow of information in the

572
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:46,450
system next slide please so the user

equipment sits<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your handheld device</font>

574
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:51,430
your laptop some light<font color="#E5E5E5"> bulbs somewhere</font>

575
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:53,919
it's a thing that needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get access to</font>

576
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:57,519
the network I interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a dhcp</font>

577
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,239
client the client is right it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

578
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:04,569
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> of DHCP or are a maybe something</font>

579
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:07,989
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's how it gets the URI it's</font>

580
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:13,839
a client to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the captive portal API it</font>

581
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:16,000
might have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human and it understands</font>

582
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,920
this you know the new set

583
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,920
ICMP messages that we've been thinking

584
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:25,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">about introducing and one thing I want</font>

585
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make clear is that what this</font>

586
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,400
architecture we don't want to specify

587
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:33,029
the UI that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the user</font>

588
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,710
equipment because that that interaction

589
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:38,470
different devices might want to do it

590
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:44,050
differently for various reasons next

591
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:49,270
slide please the dhcp server<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be the</font>

592
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:51,730
router it implements<font color="#CCCCCC"> r @ c 7 7 10 which</font>

593
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:56,259
basically the intention there is to give

594
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:57,820
the user appointments the<font color="#CCCCCC"> uri with which</font>

595
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,220
to interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the captive portal i</font>

596
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:04,600
think it initially was was intended to

597
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:06,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a generic API I don't want to speak</font>

598
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,930
for the author but that was my

599
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,720
impression but because it was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

600
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:13,839
generic URI that means we can actually

601
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:18,100
employed in API at it and have it be a

602
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:20,620
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more extensible um I think in the</font>

603
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:23,920
draft that I put up I'm even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

604
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,660
too strict about calling a dhcp server I

605
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,090
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just there's a</font>

606
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">component in the network that can give</font>

607
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:31,090
you access to the your I<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow</font>

608
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:38,589
automatically and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't mean rule</font>

609
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:41,410
um next slide please so the categorical

610
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:43,600
API server there's going to be a talk

611
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:46,149
after this talking about it so I won't

612
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:49,210
say too much about it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it's</font>

613
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:53,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing that the client interacts with</font>

614
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:56,260
the gain access to the wider<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so</font>

615
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:59,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">traditionally it would be the web server</font>

616
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,790
providing the browser where you click<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

617
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,100
yes I accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Terms of Service or</font>

618
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,529
interview login credentials but it could

619
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,759
also be some sort of generic rest api

620
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:12,400
that allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things</font>

621
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:15,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">automatically now next slide so the cat</font>

622
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,880
poor law enforcement this is a fancy way

623
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,410
of saying the thing that's walking you

624
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,870
so you know poppy the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wipe a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hotspot it</font>

625
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,990
could be a router could be you know

626
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:28,990
something in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile network but it</font>

627
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,799
is responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for enforcing the policy</font>

628
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:34,839
pick a quarrel

629
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:36,820
see and informing the user when they are

630
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,250
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access or they're about</font>

631
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:42,280
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> lose access or a few other things and</font>

632
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:45,010
I'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in a second one other</font>

633
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,370
key point is that me allow access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

634
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,330
walled garden which you might need to

635
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">get more information about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

636
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:53,620
or maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> do some free stuff you can do</font>

637
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:56,799
so it's worth calling that<font color="#CCCCCC"> out next</font>

638
00:41:53,620 --> 00:42:00,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide please so the icing be unreachable</font>

639
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,680
message this is an extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

640
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,880
icing<font color="#E5E5E5"> reachable message which indicates</font>

641
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,940
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the captive portal</font>

642
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,790
we've there was a draft about it expired

643
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:13,630
I think it's a being revived by David

644
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:15,490
bird and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> intention there is to</font>

645
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:18,190
inform the user though there's a problem

646
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:21,549
with that them having to pull the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

647
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:22,990
API server<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more further the</font>

648
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:26,440
new version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is calling out</font>

649
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:31,620
a an entirely new ICMP message type

650
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,620
which can give more sort of graceful

651
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,500
interactions after your character

652
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,150
portals been established so maybe don't

653
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,600
learn you to quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of service issues</font>

654
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:42,640
or a pending expiry or things like that

655
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:45,549
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> string the hackathon was</font>

656
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,100
kind of cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play around with so this</font>

657
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:49,300
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> some security concerns that were</font>

658
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned on the mailing list and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

659
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,750
think Weesa laid the hammer<font color="#CCCCCC"> lizotte so</font>

660
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,879
one option was to use a token for

661
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:58,870
authentication but we need to figure how

662
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,460
to get that I next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide please</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

663
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so this is kind of the workflow</font>

664
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:07,000
for someone who's using a web browser to

665
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:08,799
login<font color="#CCCCCC"> I probably need to change the</font>

666
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,090
wording in the document I don't want to

667
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,650
call it this out as being the only

668
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,150
workflow it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an example</font>

669
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:17,770
workflow<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do</font>

670
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:21,700
things but the idea is the you know the

671
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:26,590
user turns on his phone connects to the

672
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:29,109
network interaction the dhcp server

673
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:30,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Easter super gives an IP and it says hey</font>

674
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you're behind a captive portal</font>

675
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:36,130
here's the URI<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interact with it the</font>

676
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,400
user then goes to this uri and attempts

677
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:42,760
to log in log log in succeeds and sort

678
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,480
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in parallel the API server tells</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

679
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,750
captive portal

680
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,130
forcement to let that user through and

681
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:52,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the user starts interacting with</font>

682
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:56,140
the external network sometime later user

683
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:58,810
his session expires and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> API server</font>

684
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:01,810
tells the captive portal enforcement

685
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:04,180
device to block that user and then an

686
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:07,180
ICMP message is<font color="#CCCCCC"> generated and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sent to</font>

687
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:10,899
the user which forces them to or you

688
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:12,310
know pops up something on there you know

689
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">like their network monitor thing saying</font>

690
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:17,500
hey you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a captive portal what you</font>

691
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:20,530
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again that's the point of</font>

692
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,720
the ICP message there so you're some

693
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,580
very equal to some options here you know

694
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe the user just tries to connect to</font>

695
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:28,930
the internet sort of assumes there's no

696
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,880
capital portal<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the ICMP message</font>

697
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,290
would tell it that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and if</font>

698
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">there if they happen to access something</font>

699
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:36,190
behind the walled garden you don't even

700
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:38,940
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> login that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said this</font>

701
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:41,310
isn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only way of doing it um</font>

702
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,170
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some options there</font>

703
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,240
excellent this is pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much exactly</font>

704
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,530
the same uh with some sort of Internet

705
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,919
of Things device the only difference is

706
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:52,390
there's on a stick figure there the user

707
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,490
equipment basically automatically does

708
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:58,690
the login whereas before somebody would

709
00:44:54,490 --> 00:45:02,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">have hit a button next slide please all</font>

710
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:04,300
right so uh security concerns as you

711
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:06,640
know is the token approach to fishing

712
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:10,240
for icmp validation<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we going out</font>

713
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,920
roll getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> token the concern here</font>

714
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,399

just closing connections maybe it'll

drain their battery or worse or

00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:40,359
something if it pops up causes a bunch

00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:43,020

baby I service sorry I was one concern I

727
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:50,259
had is something like is someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving</font>

728
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:52,030
around with an open access point and

729
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">just having people connected to it and</font>

730
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,420
then authenticate themselves and trust

731
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,680
that connection you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> start sending</font>

their own during<font color="#E5E5E5"> their plaintext</font>

00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,710
internet traffic

734
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:01,890
through it or something um maybe there's

735
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:04,480
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to happen there too</font>

736
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:05,920
particularly for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the automatic login to</font>

737
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,260
make sure that they only<font color="#CCCCCC"> login where</font>

738
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,570
they're supposed to and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

739
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard talk that there's a hotspot 2.0 is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to solve that problem so maybe not</font>

741
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:19,630
a big deal but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

742
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:23,049
anyway so what concerns there's also

743
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:25,930
some positive sides to it so getting rid

744
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,950
of the redirect the DNS poisoning all

745
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,870
that there's a longer man in the middle

746
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,399
when we're explicitly<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying how to</font>

747
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,589
interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with things were explicitly</font>

748
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,200
saying there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to do the user</font>

749
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:36,610
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just just cleans things up and</font>

750
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,960
makes it explicit it makes it sort of

751
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:42,220
above ground and everyone can<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font>

752
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:43,360
nicely together you know what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

753
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:47,709
saw there's a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways of</font>

754
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:52,150
doing this and people seem to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

755
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:54,640
try and defeat it<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure if this will</font>

756
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:56,590
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> them not do that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully if</font>

757
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,170
there's a neat sort of all the decline

758
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:00,700
devices start implanting these simple

759
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:05,050
easy ways to authenticate there will be

760
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:07,060
some push for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> habit of portal</font>

761
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:10,930
vendors to actually adhere to the

762
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:12,930
standard and another security benefit is

763
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:16,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cat the portal is restricted to what</font>

764
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:18,580
the dhcp server a router<font color="#E5E5E5"> appetizer or</font>

765
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:21,970
whatever said so you can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go off</font>

766
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:24,310
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> else probably going to be you</font>

767
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:25,540
know attached to a well-known<font color="#E5E5E5"> device to</font>

768
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:30,910
get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> login and give me your</font>

769
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:33,520
credentials um next time just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a reminder</font>

770
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:37,210
we make a move along a little bit okay

771
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:40,180
uh so I bunch one<font color="#CCCCCC"> into questions um I</font>

772
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,650
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the some stuff I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

773
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:46,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer on the working group to it was</font>

774
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:49,840
document forward um I guess I'll mostly

775
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:53,080
skip these uh and can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we always talk</font>

776
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:57,190
about them in mailing those itself so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

777
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:59,319
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so next step so what we</font>

778
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:01,480
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with it if we want to keep</font>

779
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on it is it a waste of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time i</font>

780
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,940
hope not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd like to see see it move</font>

781
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:08,770
forward I don't know if they're working

782
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,430
group should adopt it now or it's too

783
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:13,910
early um

784
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:15,200
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think well from my</font>

785
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:16,759
perspective i'd like i'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a</font>

786
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,240
little more discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this and a</font>

787
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,670
little more feedback and probably some

788
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,040
of the architectural questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

789
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:27,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">be explored in a little more detail</font>

790
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,119
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we want to actually ask</font>

791
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:30,410
the room whether this is something we

792
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,990
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on but it's certainly</font>

793
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,790
promising<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right that's on that's</font>

794
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:36,529
largely a personal opinion because I've

795
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:38,558
not singled on the discussion yet so I'd

796
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:41,930
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that I i agree with you</font>

797
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:44,750
honestly so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty much</font>

798
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:46,098
the end of the presentation sales hey

799
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,480
questions won't stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and answer a</font>

800
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:51,770
few questions let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep this</font>

801
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:56,930
short um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know who was first</font>

802
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:59,119
anyway I source don't one what is it um

803
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,290
so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a girl to get rid</font>

804
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,089
of the redirect we're gonna have to do

805
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:05,240
that until<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know until the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

806
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:08,150
until the end of time anyway so you know

807
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:10,848
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't seem to be a goal I</font>

808
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:13,369
wish we had something better to do than

809
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:16,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICMP method it seems like really</font>

810
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:17,930
messy it gets right limited<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's you</font>

811
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,779
know to some degree subject to forging

812
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:24,348
it sort of be better if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had something</font>

813
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:27,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">else one thing that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we discussed</font>

814
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:31,190
this in forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> what at least you know to</font>

815
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:34,099
ITX ago maybe if the captive portal is

816
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:35,990
time-based just tell the tell the device

817
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:37,880
how long it's got left on the clock and

818
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:40,368
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on the ICMP</font>

819
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,950
message if its 24-hour thing just say

820
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:45,589
hey in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2400 login is good for 24 hours</font>

821
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:49,368
and you know if you want to check

822
00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:51,950
periodically here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL and then you</font>

823
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:53,569
can don't need the ICMP messages at all

824
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:55,250
really because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can as soon as the</font>

825
00:49:53,569 --> 00:49:57,430
device says lie on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing is not</font>

826
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:00,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">working it can just check the URL now</font>

827
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:03,259
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think most of the components</font>

828
00:50:00,109 --> 00:50:05,900
actually provide benefit on their own so

829
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:08,660
just the API server could help just the

830
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,369
dhcp a extensions can help and you could

831
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:15,200
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some adjust the ICMP messages</font>

832
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:16,520
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to iterate a bit more</font>

833
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,790
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture to figure out what's</font>

834
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:21,500
actually necessary and talk about what

835
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:24,170
the benefits of each of the components

836
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,690
are amigos will have helped give some

837
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:29,119
you know follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> on drafts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

838
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:33,799
recommendations and methods of building

839
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:36,740
real systems Margaret<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cullen painless</font>

840
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:38,900
security I think I think you were right

841
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:42,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it should have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more in</font>

842
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:44,780
there about both of the HP and the RA

843
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:47,599
option both of which are in 7710 that's

844
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:50,869
just editorial really I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with what</font>

845
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:54,160
Lorenzo said about the ICMP messages I'd

846
00:50:50,869 --> 00:50:57,290
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add I mean one is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I see</font>

847
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,270
some fear that these ICMP messages could

848
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:01,119
be used to shut down nodes in cases

849
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:05,960
where there isn't even a captive portal

850
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:09,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the other is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh if you're</font>

851
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to implement a new spec i think we</font>

852
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:12,920
probably want them to implement a new

853
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:16,309
spec<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually goes in and navigates</font>

854
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,230
the portal well you say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ICMP</font>

855
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:20,839
messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> add something on their own but</font>

856
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:23,000
there was a previous draft for it that

857
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:25,940
apparently didn't have enough traction

858
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,579
to think it would add on its own right

859
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:31,339
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not I think it raises a</font>

860
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:34,130
potential attack and I don't think it

861
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:35,660
helps that much well there we had some

862
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:38,180
pretty discussions during the hackathon

863
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:42,020
about what the ICMP messages could give

864
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:45,230
you um and I mean maybe you could do

865
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:47,089
without it but um you know David's

866
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:48,920
working on on a new version of a draft

867
00:51:47,089 --> 00:51:51,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I died I think it's worth discussing</font>

868
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,150
the draft a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one who's</font>

869
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:55,700
workin on cuz it does extend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> IC</font>

870
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:59,809
because of quite a bit and maybe you

871
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:01,308
know I oh man maybe the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who had</font>

872
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:03,859
ideas that the heck<font color="#E5E5E5"> have thought about</font>

873
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:05,230
how it could help could either jump up

874
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:08,450
or write them to the list or something

875
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:10,220
so the rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us could see that and</font>

876
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:11,750
have an opinion we could have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

877
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,149
discussion I'll summarize a few of them

878
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:17,059
later I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> um in my hackathon</font>

879
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:18,650
presentation and I think that those who

880
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:20,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">did have a tease definitely please post</font>

881
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:23,200
them to list because that will generate

882
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:25,369
discussion foster<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of thing I</font>

883
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,308
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> without further implementation</font>

884
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:29,900
though they won't do anything and

885
00:52:28,309 --> 00:52:32,270
somebody has to implement those ICMP

886
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,740
messages I use my hackathon thing it's

887
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,910
you know I understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

888
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,140
don't understand is if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

889
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:37,670
go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you going to put new code and</font>

890
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,118
don't we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new code in</font>

891
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,980
that

892
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:41,960
actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than that that's I</font>

893
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,289
that's my concern I guess you're you

894
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:49,700
know which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the most part to do friend</font>

895
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:51,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay middle kappa pista so in a previous</font>

896
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,029
presentation there was a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> details</font>

897
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,160
about the different behaviors that are

898
00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:57,619
currently implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the devices as</font>

899
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,509
far as I understood this<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

900
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not backward compatible with existing</font>

901
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:07,309
devices so this may be fine okay but if

902
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:10,339
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strong reasons why</font>

903
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:11,690
the proposals from the working group

904
00:53:10,339 --> 00:53:14,240
should not be compatible with<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing</font>

905
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:18,619
devices it must be augmented very

906
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:21,019
strongly I think the this the cap our

907
00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:24,170
API talks with backwards compatibility

908
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:25,430
so if you go to that server and so you

909
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,349
would read you know I suppose you were

910
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:28,220
you you're behind a captive portal and

911
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:30,049
they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really support anything</font>

912
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,819
other than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> redirect then it would</font>

913
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:33,559
redirect you to that API and it would

914
00:53:31,819 --> 00:53:40,880
just serve up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old browser style</font>

915
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:42,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">webpage yarning did the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problems when</font>

916
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">you when you first create a new</font>

917
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:49,038
connection you get an ICMP unreachable

918
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:53,180
and and devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail may just bail like</font>

919
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:55,970
what okay what<font color="#E5E5E5"> should i do not nothing</font>

920
00:53:53,180 --> 00:54:03,308
probably why is that any worse than like

921
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:03,308
what happens htps right now good point

922
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:10,749
it would not even wear a quiz HTTP we're

923
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:16,279
going to cut the lines here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think so</font>

924
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:18,618
yeah you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> off here and well where's</font>

925
00:54:16,279 --> 00:54:25,039
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> baseline is what we described in the</font>

926
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:26,569
previous slides and this is I think what

927
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:28,160
you're proposing here is considerably

928
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:32,900
less clunky than what we're doing today

929
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:35,598
so it's a kind of a good thing the thing

930
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:37,940
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have today kind of works</font>

931
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:41,960
mostly and where it doesn't work is

932
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:45,009
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who put on put up the</font>

933
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:48,279
portal are actively defeating it and

934
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:51,230
because we sort of at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> partially</font>

935
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:52,010
understand why they're doing it I don't

936
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,350
see how that's

937
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:56,570
of their issues I mean why wouldn't they

938
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:58,100
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defeat this thing as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much as</font>

939
00:54:56,570 --> 00:55:01,600
they are defeating the things that

940
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:04,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">already exists that's one concern I had</font>

941
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,860
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a compelling</font>

942
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:09,080
argument that it solves those problems

943
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,750
and find out what those problems are to

944
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:14,150
make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference yeah all right let's</font>

945
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:18,050
David burden just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment about the</font>

946
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:20,480
ICMP so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is that at an ass right</font>

947
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">today only has a few options</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when it has</font>

948
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,710
traffic that it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> will let through</font>

949
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,840
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> either just black hole it if its</font>

950
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:28,970
GPU can give it a reset or it can give

951
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:32,600
it a destination unreachable the idea

952
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:34,399
the cow port ICMP extension is just to

953
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,410
give the the user equipment a little bit

954
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:40,670
more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so instead of just</font>

955
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:43,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving it a distinction unreachable and</font>

956
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,320
then the assuming is not accessible this

957
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,520
actually indicates is behind me captive

958
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,800
portal so it gets a little bit extra

959
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,860
information but why you were your packet

960
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:53,960
was dropped and i don't see why where

961
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:56,750
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be any additional security</font>

962
00:55:53,960 --> 00:56:01,280
considerations above this station

963
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:04,310
original ICP you'd be surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

964
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,580
Chris Sale from Hutchison um speaking

965
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:10,160
from mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> operators perspective the</font>

966
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,560
only issue I have is on the dhcp are a

967
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,040
side I can I don't think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> put a way of</font>

968
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:20,560
issuing a URI as well as the IP address

969
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:23,090
cuz it mobile networks in PDP context

970
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,950
they provide you with the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

971
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:31,370
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> Westerfield that I'm aware of</font>

972
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:35,210
there is a I'm not sure if the next talk

973
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:39,049
can help with that does Tommy do you

974
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:40,670
know if the question was in mobile how

975
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:42,920
do you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> addy you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are I to the</font>

976
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:44,570
handheld device if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a dhcp</font>

977
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,410
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suggest you talk to someone</font>

978
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:49,490
who's more familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

979
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:52,850
configuration architecture of those

980
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:54,680
networks I'm pretty committee yeah if

981
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:58,819
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no food if there is no field</font>

982
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:00,799
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing be 40 assuming</font>

983
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:02,690
they're doing v6 I assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

984
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,570
seasonal inviting focus is usually put

00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:07,000
private IP address ranges

986
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:08,470
right but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I mean my point is I</font>

987
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's great solution because I mean</font>

988
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:13,049
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> use I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have for this is prepaid</font>

989
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,210
customers have run out of credit and

990
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:19,570
they either get a nice message on a page

991
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:20,770
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pattern is we pay or if they</font>

992
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:25,480
get nothing they'll be calling the call

993
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:28,150
center with much prefer the format so

994
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:31,660
maybe maybe those people can be can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

995
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:34,060
the URL printed somewhere for them maybe

996
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:35,980
i just i'm just making aware that yep

997
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:41,910
let me need a slider ideally would have

998
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:44,950
a wider solution it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> david olson</font>

999
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:47,109
co-author on the Strand we the questions

1000
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:48,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ICMP we did give some thought to</font>

1001
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,760
it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that some of the concerns</font>

1002
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:54,420
are you know couldnt off path attacker

1003
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:58,690
send icmp packets to try to disrupt

1004
00:57:54,420 --> 00:58:02,050
random people the way I was thinking

1005
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:05,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that was compared to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1006
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:08,680
currently you could try to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

1007
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:12,270
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this case we thank you know</font>

1008
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:15,490
unlike the 307 let's go to redirect the

1009
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:18,100
the URL is not coming in that message so

1010
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:20,799
on the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand you know the worst you</font>

1011
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:23,049
can do is make the user go to the portal

1012
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:27,430
URL you can't make them go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an</font>

1013
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:28,690
arbitrary<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL and to commit it you know</font>

1014
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:33,399
that well then you could say maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1015
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:35,950
could you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doss the URL with by</font>

1016
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,570
reflection but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um then went that's what</font>

1017
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:40,960
we were thinking about Kyle mentioned

1018
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,580
the token or something if you could put

1019
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,920
something something in there that was

1020
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:47,860
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to guess you could make it you know</font>

1021
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,300
at least as hard as killing a session

1022
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:52,510
with a tease if you reset or something

1023
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:57,100
so you know that that's a thought womb

1024
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:59,380
and discussion on narrowing or sorry

1025
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,620
fixing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it weighs like that is how we</font>

1026
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:05,430
were thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so we think it's</font>

1027
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:05,430
better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

1028
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:12,990
if you'd really quick yeah I want to

1029
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,660
make one<font color="#E5E5E5"> less coming about that and that</font>

1030
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:18,899
was perhaps we could also require on

1031
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:20,310
processing this ICMP message that we

1032
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,410
actually validate that some part of the

1033
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:24,270
message that is responding to is there

1034
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:25,740
right so you had to be a non path

1035
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:29,250
attacker because the capture portal

1036
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:31,290
device must effectively be on on path

1037
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:33,119
right I believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ICMP</font>

1038
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:35,660
unreachable message contained quotes the

1039
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,340
original packet I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't so every much</font>

1040
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:42,899
sorry not a lot of entropy in there I'm

1041
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:46,800
afraid so tasting it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very very very</font>

1042
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:49,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">small you got something before I think</font>

1043
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:51,830
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut this one the necks and</font>

1044
00:59:49,470 --> 01:00:04,770
Tommy's going to talk briefly about

1045
00:59:51,830 --> 01:00:06,840
provisioning the domains hello everyone

1046
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:09,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm tell me Paulie from Apple I'm a</font>

1047
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:14,490
co-author with a bunch of other friendly

1048
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:17,790
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> Francisco on a draft for doing</font>

1049
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:19,770
provisioning domains and what I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1050
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">highlight here is not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole draft</font>

1051
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:25,020
but specifically the part of it that

1052
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:26,730
applies to captive portals next ok so

1053
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,080
what our provisioning domains not

1054
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:32,580
everyone knows what they are unless

1055
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:36,259
you've gone to myth<font color="#E5E5E5"> x1 so it's defined</font>

1056
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:39,210
in RFC 755<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a myth document</font>

1057
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:42,000
essentially a PVD is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> self consistent</font>

1058
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:46,080
set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration information that a</font>

1059
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:49,890
host can use so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your addresses</font>

1060
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,779
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS how can I actually effectively</font>

1061
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:57,900
use one particular network connectivity

1062
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:59,430
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are two conceptual</font>

1063
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,840
ways of getting these things one is

1064
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:04,529
through implicit discovery and that's

1065
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:07,650
essentially what everyone does now you

1066
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:10,200
get provision things by dhcp it's a few

1067
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:12,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ras some things you know just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1068
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:15,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm connected to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Wi-Fi i know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> l VPNs have their own</font>

1070
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,590
whole set of configuration that comes

1071
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:20,870
down all of these configure what a

1072
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:23,970
device can consider if you

1073
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:27,630
also includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS attributes so these</font>

1074
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:30,799
are great but the holes that we have our

1075
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:33,300
when you potentially have multiple PVD

1076
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">uplinks from what looks to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you like a</font>

1077
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,660
single interface so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a Wi-Fi</font>

1078
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:39,330
router that actually gives me access to

1079
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:41,549
multiple networks that's very hyper

1080
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">cooling like the home net cases so in</font>

1081
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:45,690
those cases I am blind to those other

1082
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">PPD's that may be there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but then there's</font>

1083
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:50,370
also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case in which there are</font>

1084
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:53,610
properties about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pvm associated to</font>

1085
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:55,890
like its captive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also blind to</font>

1086
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:58,560
those attributes and effectively I want

1087
01:01:55,890 --> 01:02:01,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">those to be part of my PVD and sometimes</font>

1088
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:03,620
essentially like you know an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple</font>

1089
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:06,600
device Android device we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1090
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:08,640
infer that oh yeah i did this probe its

1091
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,110
captive and we just guess and we put

1092
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:13,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the pbd information but it's</font>

1093
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:15,810
not explicit next slide so a lot of what

1094
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:19,170
this draft is about is saying can we

1095
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally have a way to explicitly define</font>

1096
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:26,010
new PVD s and what the PVD attributes

1097
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:28,710
are so this is required to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use multiple</font>

1098
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:31,620
PVD s on a single interface the draft

1099
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:34,920
goes into how you can have essentially a

1100
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:37,319
PVD for each ipv6 prefix DVDs are given

1101
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">out by different Ras and rs have a PPD</font>

1102
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:42,480
ID which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nephew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t and inside of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1103
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:45,390
but we can also use that to convey

1104
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,340
extended attributes so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

1105
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:50,970
captivity or limited access walled

1106
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:52,590
garden attributes<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost requirements what</font>

1107
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:55,140
could have a quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> should you expect</font>

1108
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:56,490
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time out so this list could</font>

1109
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,990
grow and grow and grow and it's not

1110
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:59,310
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much is appropriate to</font>

1111
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:03,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">have in here but we wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

1112
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:05,580
conversation started next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1113
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:08,190
we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about this for a</font>

1114
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:10,410
while we're also very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interestin captive</font>

1115
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:12,390
portal we see the conversations going

1116
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:13,470
very much in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same place of oh we</font>

1117
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:14,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to know where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this type of</font>

1118
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:16,230
network and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to contact</font>

1119
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to get more information and</font>

1120
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:20,850
interact with it it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

1121
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:23,609
parallel so my main goal presenting this

1122
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:26,549
is saying can we make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't go</font>

1123
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:29,490
down two different paths is there a way

1124
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:31,410
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a kind of coherent</font>

1125
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:33,029
story that gets the captive portal

1126
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:34,040
benefits and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually convince</font>

1127
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,950
captain

1128
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:39,170
portal vendors to implement this and

1129
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:41,870
also get<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco routers and home that</font>

1130
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:46,700
Roberts to implement the same thing next

1131
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:48,259
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so in this draft just takes a</font>

1132
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:53,509
stab at proposing here is one way we

1133
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:55,730
think we could do it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1134
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:58,460
PVD is identified by a fully qualified

1135
01:03:55,730 --> 01:04:00,740
domain name in the draft it comes down

1136
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:03,380
through an RA it could come from

1137
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:05,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else it can come from your VPN</font>

1138
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:09,230
your carrier could provision in the same

1139
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:14,800
way that it provisions the addresses we

1140
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:18,980
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care how it gets pushed down slide</font>

1141
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:21,500
go and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would want to be able to</font>

1142
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:23,780
if you have other metadata go out and

1143
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:25,760
query that I'm in the draft it says you

1144
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:28,060
know go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an HBS connection to some</font>

1145
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,830
JSON file that's based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your PVD ID</font>

1146
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:33,770
this is very nascent it needs to be

1147
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:36,319
expanded upon but I think it'd be good

1148
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does this API look similar to</font>

1149
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,770
what we're about to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear about from the</font>

1150
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:42,140
captive portal API can those end up

1151
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:45,170
being a similar mechanism or does this

1152
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:46,490
blob then point you to the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> api is</font>

1153
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:49,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">it on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same server as a different</font>

1154
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:52,819
thing you can interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with next slide</font>

1155
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:54,830
so here are just a subset of the

1156
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:57,980
properties that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were listed in the draft</font>

1157
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:59,630
it lists a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of options based on</font>

1158
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,880
presentation earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure we need to</font>

1159
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:03,380
call a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out I imagine that</font>

1160
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,210
will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to split up the drop</font>

1161
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,770
into like here's the ID and here's how

1162
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:11,090
you discover where to talk to and then

1163
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:13,130
you can extend what you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to but</font>

1164
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:14,630
basic parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> unit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has have name says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1165
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:16,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">are your prefixes do you have internet</font>

1166
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:19,550
either the captive portal if it is

1167
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:21,500
what's the API can use to interact with

1168
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">it this could allow us to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finish we have</font>

1169
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,960
different versions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how we interact</font>

1170
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:29,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">with captor portals etc etc timeouts</font>

1171
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,950
when she<font color="#E5E5E5"> unix check in with me that's a</font>

1172
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:36,620
way of potentially avoiding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICMP</font>

1173
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:39,560
ground yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to summarize these</font>

1174
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:42,259
problem areas look very similar the PVD

1175
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:47,069
area is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just think the generalized</font>

1176
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:50,009
form of the captive portal problem so

1177
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:53,449
please give your feedback on that let's

1178
01:05:50,009 --> 01:05:56,209
see if we can have cohesive solutions

1179
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:59,339
just kind of thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1180
01:05:56,209 --> 01:06:01,649
structures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that incentivize people to do</font>

1181
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:05,038
something or not if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways in</font>

1182
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:06,809
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you say enterprises and</font>

1183
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,390
other groups want to start deploying PVD

1184
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:11,369
s because that allows the end devices to

1185
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:15,989
get new cool interactions and new

1186
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:17,279
features is there other goodies that we

1187
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:19,920
can toss in there that will incentivize

1188
01:06:17,279 --> 01:06:21,329
them to adopt these models and then oh

1189
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,279
look we also happen to know their

1190
01:06:21,329 --> 01:06:25,559
captive at the same time of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1191
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:28,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't get all the malicious people who</font>

1192
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:30,539
want to just check us through but at

1193
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:34,259
least the you know cutting edge devices

1194
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:38,759
would work better with this new<font color="#CCCCCC"> book so</font>

1195
01:06:34,259 --> 01:06:40,049
you feedback would be appreciated I'm

1196
01:06:38,759 --> 01:06:41,880
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to suggest that this one requires</font>

1197
01:06:40,049 --> 01:06:44,489
a little bit of thinking thanks for

1198
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:47,249
doing the presentation but with the

1199
01:06:44,489 --> 01:06:48,619
draft read the draft think about how

1200
01:06:47,249 --> 01:06:51,979
this how this is going to fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> in with</font>

1201
01:06:48,619 --> 01:06:54,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the various people who have</font>

1202
01:06:51,979 --> 01:06:55,788
architectures and protocols in mind

1203
01:06:54,029 --> 01:07:00,660
think about how that's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit in</font>

1204
01:06:55,789 --> 01:07:06,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some this is seems very close</font>

1205
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:08,759
you're right yes David brewed the API or

1206
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:10,739
the URL that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he pointed to is you</font>

1207
01:07:08,759 --> 01:07:18,390
picture that on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nass or on the web</font>

1208
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:22,699
server yes that yes it this is either

1209
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:25,799
one yes either it's open to discussion

1210
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:29,069
why I offer that on an ass you need a

1211
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:32,449
certificate per device right right

1212
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:35,940
that's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh costly yeah I I think</font>

1213
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:37,709
it could be much further up potentially

1214
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:40,380
in some cases in which we let's say I'm

1215
01:07:37,709 --> 01:07:43,019
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovering information about my</font>

1216
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,420
PVD which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like I'm on gogo</font>

1217
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:47,488
inflight or<font color="#CCCCCC"> its comcast and it just</font>

1218
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:50,069
takes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some like master server</font>

1219
01:07:47,489 --> 01:07:51,569
that's kind of behind everything yeah

1220
01:07:50,069 --> 01:07:53,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erica I think you just I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

1221
01:07:51,569 --> 01:07:58,349
device would just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let that</font>

1222
01:07:53,989 --> 01:08:01,170
through right you know HTTPS to with the

1223
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:03,210
nests and I of<font color="#E5E5E5"> O Lord this a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> night</font>

1224
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:06,540
of that of that name would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

1225
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:10,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">be allowed through yeah um if this were</font>

1226
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:11,940
part and parcel<font color="#CCCCCC"> iou whitelist the IP or</font>

1227
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:16,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">what if whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think is missing oh</font>

1228
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:19,920
yeah I think I you know I'm a fan of

1229
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:24,330
dvds I do think that there's more

1230
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:25,679
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here than certain things</font>

1231
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:27,330
wrong in certain places and there's

1232
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,770
sometimes some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff seems to be</font>

1233
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:30,509
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have two places</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1234
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:32,160
things I think when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to like</font>

1235
01:08:30,509 --> 01:08:34,198
expressing charging information that

1236
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,759
kind of stuff I would rather presume the

1237
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:37,318
feed device that's actually blocking me

1238
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,899
is the thing that would know what my

1239
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:42,420
charging is not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the PVD and</font>

1240
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:45,089
so we could leave that to the rest api

1241
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:49,770
to talk to the device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what do i</font>

1242
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:51,689
do if i have rfcs 7710 URL and a PVD

1243
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:54,600
captive portal URL and they're not the

1244
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:58,049
same right yep that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1245
01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:00,179
reconciled right a lot of these

1246
01:08:58,049 --> 01:09:02,910
attributes you know maybe they don't

1247
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:05,640
belong directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the PVD but i imagine</font>

1248
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:07,620
when we store them we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> store them</font>

1249
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,779
somehow in associate like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this thing</font>

1250
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:18,149
is associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's and we scoped to</font>

1251
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:23,310
within this PVD<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially so what</font>

1252
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:25,410
run security I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> um ah actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1253
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:27,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great and I think for two</font>

1254
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:30,599
reasons first of all it might work and

1255
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:33,870
and second<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like I honestly don't</font>

1256
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:37,440
know if it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> work but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font>

1257
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:39,000
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work the PVD general</font>

1258
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,169
infrastructure will be so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the</font>

1259
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,880
richer for having tackled this

1260
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:44,069
challenging problem right in the sense

1261
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,690
that here<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you if you try to solve</font>

1262
01:09:44,069 --> 01:09:48,449
the captive portal problem with this you

1263
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:50,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">will have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build update ability you</font>

1264
01:09:48,448 --> 01:09:52,500
know maybe scopes or whatever all this

1265
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:54,299
stuff right you really needs to be in

1266
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,070
there for example like you know how do

1267
01:09:54,299 --> 01:09:57,570
you how do you check you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what do</font>

1268
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:59,040
you do when the captive portal goes from

1269
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:00,960
closed to open because you logged in

1270
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:04,080
right how do you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> do give it a</font>

1271
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:06,420
different PVD ID do you like change the

1272
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,760
URL like what do you do right and so

a is it is a matter point for the whole

1278
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:23,500
you know we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone over this I think</font>

it is not ever should not ever be a goal

for this group to work on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to</font>

1282
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:34,360
optimize for the case where an operator

1283
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:36,099
is trying to defeat the portal right

1284
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:37,630
because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just no point in that</font>

1285
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:40,090
right if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they want to do</font>

1286
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:42,340
it's a business reason and you know we

1287
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:44,560
can we can get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> an arms race but</font>

1288
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:46,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not something that's and some of</font>

1289
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,560
us might and some of us might not but

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not something that we need to</font>

malicious cases or let's say conflicts

01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:02,830
of interest let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know do this</font>

for participating parties that means our

API doesn't have to be as white as

paranoid as you might do as you might

need if you're trying to address a

1302

complex right and just one thing back to

1303
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:18,070
that point is you're saying also that

1304
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:19,450
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good problem for us</font>

have interactions that are similar to a

for you but if you understand what why

1337
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:38,219
they're doing what they're doing then if

1338
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:44,130
like they need access to the regular

can provide that or we can decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1344
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:01,080
a place well with a captive portal that

1345
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:06,050
I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter a username and password</font>

1346
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:08,309
and I get the phone dialogue and I just

1347
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:10,469
dismiss it because I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

the regular project because the regular

01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:15,440
browser remembers all my username and

1350
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:17,760
password and it's much<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier that way</font>

1351
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,489
we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to understand why they</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that doing a survey of this like what we</font>

people avoid going through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cap</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">referral is very useful as a design</font>

1359
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:41,550
consideration but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the solution</font>

1360
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:42,960
to that long term if there is one is not

1361
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:45,480
going to be a protocol one it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1362
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:48,000
be one for the vendors to change the UI

1363
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:50,040
to change how they interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1364
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,710
things to either give people what they

1365
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,390
want or convince and they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1366
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:56,520
but that's I think solving the problem

1367
01:13:54,390 --> 01:14:02,719
in the protocol aspect is not for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:02,719
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay where's muck</font>

01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:18,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright um you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minutes I'm sorry</font>

1370
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,769
but you'll have to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick I</font>

1371
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:23,910
noticed how many slides you have quick

1372
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:25,980
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we put together a proposal</font>

1373
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:29,280
for a captive for a captive portal

1374
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:31,980
protocols so that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices that speak</font>

1375
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:37,830
it can get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the to the captain</font>

Porter portal next first thing that's a

1377
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:41,880
the first bit of feedback was that

1378
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:43,860
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to see examples of what</font>

1379
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:47,070
the protocol would it look like so

1380
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:49,980
here's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> walkthrough starts with URL</font>

with the value of whatever they give you

using the assumption that the cat port

1508
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:45,920
API server would just use the source

1509
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:48,290
address as the session figuring that

1510

since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the network equipment it</font>

1511
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:56,210
would it it would know another option

1512
01:21:54,080 --> 01:22:01,160
would be that the cat port API a URL

1513
01:21:56,210 --> 01:22:02,780
could be the dhcp are a URL can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

different for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cesar equipments and</font>

1515
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:07,130
that could effectively be a session the

01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:13,000
draft would definitely benefit from

1517

examples here and that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of it</font>

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions I'm going to stop with</font>

1520
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:23,270
observe that you are designing a

01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:27,860
protocol that's very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the acne</font>

1527
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:43,760
at that do I will from an HTTP

1528
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,170
perspective it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much cleaner design</font>

1529
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:48,470
than what you have here obviously what

the is rough crafting the very

01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:00,410

01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:05,630
look at older versions and see why they

removed those things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find</font>

1560
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:16,880

1564
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:24,860
wonder maybe we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

1565
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:26,570
having some mechanism for comedy thing

what this protocol is doing because

01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:13,630
there's essentially no way to prove

decides to store the terms in terms of

1605
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:07,330
document was the networks and then a

subset<font color="#CCCCCC"> if underneath</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> networks there's a</font>

1607
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:11,890
there's set a set of networks and one of

01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:13,390
them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called default and I didn't</font>

1611
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:20,190
multiple networks and not just the one

1612
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:22,660
purpose there is if the captive portals

1613
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:25,509
has multiple networks that it guards

1614
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:28,690
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protected networks if you</font>

1615
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:30,460
have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the if you have a captive</font>

portal in your office corporate

1617
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:35,620
environments that has the walls off

1618
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:38,170
guest access that gets you access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1619
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:40,480
internet only versus corporate access if

1620
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:42,580
you have the the right username and

1621
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:45,459
password to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's one of</font>

1622
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:46,630
the thoughts that I'd had there so the

1623
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:48,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is that think this should be</font>

1624
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:49,900
presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the client though the</font>

1625
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:53,080
client should be allowed to like say I'm

1626
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:54,730
on this VLAN I'm on whatever Network I'm

1627
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:57,969
on whatever SSID I'm attached to and I

1628
01:26:54,730 --> 01:27:00,759
want to select to be routed to guest or

1629
01:26:57,969 --> 01:27:02,590
two core<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to lab or something yeah or</font>

1630
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,770
what I mean the other one is when a

1631
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:07,469
hotel will give you free access if you

1632
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:09,610
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide your name and room number</font>

1633
01:27:07,469 --> 01:27:11,860
about they'll give you high speed access

1634
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:14,320
if you provide payment information and

1635
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:18,400
yes I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the you I</font>

1636
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:20,769
would be either like an IOT device that

1637
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:23,080
just wants limited access might just

1638
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:24,550
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever is cheapest but i would</font>

1639
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,900
think on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone or whatever you'd</font>

1640
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:27,199
want to

1641
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:31,139
pick whether you're taking the slow

1642
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:32,730
non-pay or the higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost so fast</font>

1643
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:34,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how we can make</font>

1644
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:35,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision for you so yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

1645
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:38,370
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be in the UI it's all the</font>

1646
01:27:35,909 --> 01:27:42,989
same l2 l3 infrastructure just like

1647
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:46,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">different parameters on top I see thanks</font>

1648
01:27:42,989 --> 01:27:48,928
Tommy Polly Apple to that point i also

1649
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:51,239
find the hierarchy of networks

1650
01:27:48,929 --> 01:27:53,159
potentially a little confusing it also

1651
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:57,690
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe overlap with dvds i</font>

1652
01:27:53,159 --> 01:28:01,940
don't know but i can c HC like from<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1653
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:04,290
think like a VPN I say Who I am i

1654
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:06,480
authenticate to you and based on the

1655
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:08,159
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> I choose and we negotiate</font>

1656
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:10,559
between us you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may put me in a different</font>

1657
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:12,150
group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me different access so if</font>

1658
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:15,330
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have like authentication options</font>

1659
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:17,309
of like well really here's the things

1660
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:19,280
i'm willing to give you and then based

1661
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:21,750
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get dumped into a different</font>

1662
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:24,480
access pocket on the captive portal so

1663
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:26,580
if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the admin credentials</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i go to</font>

1664
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,379
that but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average user who has just</font>

1665
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:29,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">the room number doesn't need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know who</font>

1666
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:33,440
there's this admin thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can try to</font>

1667
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:33,440
poke it and see what it does

1668
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:44,400
chef Easter so just to comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> on desert</font>

1669
01:28:41,459 --> 01:28:46,349
as well so that's under multiple

1670
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,780
networks that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

1671
01:28:46,349 --> 01:28:51,449
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PBS and that's</font>

1672
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:53,969
something that is more general than just

1673
01:28:51,449 --> 01:28:55,650
captive<font color="#CCCCCC"> photos the fact that even on a</font>

1674
01:28:53,969 --> 01:28:57,749
single link<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may have multiple ways</font>

1675
01:28:55,650 --> 01:29:01,138
of accessing to the network so it could

1676
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:05,880
be maybe not the best idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the</font>

1677
01:29:01,139 --> 01:29:08,880
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem twice so I think the right</font>

1678
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:11,880
way to do it is in the network layer so

1679
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:14,070
using arrays and not as part of the

1680
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:16,530
captive powerful API so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1681
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:18,478
have multiple ways to multiple captive

1682
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:22,728
bottles virtually empty bottles you can

1683
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:27,989
provide multiple DVDs using<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6</font>

1684
01:29:22,729 --> 01:29:30,360
proposal and and then do the cap having

1685
01:29:27,989 --> 01:29:31,919
multiple captive<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottles I think that</font>

1686
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:35,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be a simpler option than</font>

1687
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:44,219
having two layers with twice multiple

1688
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:46,829
networks thank you and so we're almost

1689
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:48,749
done as well on the time Carl did you

1690
01:29:46,829 --> 01:29:51,179
have any very short summary that you

1691
01:29:48,749 --> 01:29:54,659
want to share the slides are up here

1692
01:29:51,179 --> 01:29:56,699
Kyle was going to present time

1693
01:29:54,659 --> 01:29:58,379
permitting but we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> having such a</font>

1694
01:29:56,699 --> 01:30:00,299
good discussion on the other things I

1695
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:02,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it was probably time better spent</font>

1696
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:06,650
on on those just spend a couple of

1697
01:30:02,699 --> 01:30:06,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and sort of explain what you did</font>

1698
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:12,989
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hackathon on on saturday</font>

1699
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:14,099
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sunday yeah so when I this bunch of</font>

1700
01:30:12,989 --> 01:30:16,049
people in this room actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> were at the</font>

1701
01:30:14,099 --> 01:30:17,639
hackathon working on this so essentially

1702
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:21,449
we had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptops wired together</font>

1703
01:30:17,639 --> 01:30:25,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">um and we put together an API server uh</font>

1704
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:26,940
and puts my C&P stuff a<font color="#CCCCCC"> client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my cmp</font>

1705
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:30,360
stuff in the captive portal and made so

1706
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:32,940
that when you connect you pretty much

1707
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:35,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the instant you try to do</font>

1708
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:36,869
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you automatically log in and</font>

1709
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:39,570
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have network access so we</font>

1710
01:30:36,869 --> 01:30:43,249
implanted the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICMP on the client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

1711
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:45,478
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cata portal we implemented</font>

1712
01:30:43,249 --> 01:30:47,579
something kind of like the cow to portal

1713
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:50,400
API to describe the draft not quite on

1714
01:30:47,579 --> 01:30:51,570
the server itself sorry on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the con the</font>

1715
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:55,110
cap

1716
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:59,549
enforcement device itself um we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1717
01:30:55,110 --> 01:31:03,200
tcpdump and Wireshark work to dissect to

1718
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:07,350
the captive portal<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICP enhancements and</font>

1719
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:09,840
I think we also implemented up in plenty

1720
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:11,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the dhcp server side stuff but never</font>

1721
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,620
got have really tested it because the

1722
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:15,269
client side stuff wasn't done but no it

1723
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:18,090
worked and it was it was actually not

1724
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:19,440
that hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do raw sockets made it</font>

1725
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:22,080
pretty easy to do in Linux it's not

1726
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:24,360
perfect but it's it's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1727
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:27,410
proof of concept we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably keep</font>

1728
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:29,820
moving forward to test out and prototype

1729
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:31,680
new versions to various drafts and I

1730
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:35,900
think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be neat to sort of have</font>

1731
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:40,740
that on going outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the hackathons</font>

1732
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:42,900
pretty much it thanks con and thanks

1733
