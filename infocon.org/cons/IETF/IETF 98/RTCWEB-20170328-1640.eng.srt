70
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:14,560
our dependencies is uh that list is

71
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,320
about half the length that we were lost

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,660
the time okay and so most of the

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,370
documents so that we actually you know

74
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,479
normatively depend on across several

75
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:28,210
groups have moved to the state of you

76
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,979
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> up requested or are further along</font>

77
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:35,030
which is really good

78
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,980
let's see most of these are actually

79
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,369
moving along quite well I think the

80
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,200
actual stuff in this working group I

81
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,440
fecund the IP handling stuff will be

82
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:48,050
discussing later<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour but tomorrow</font>

83
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,730
friday i guess and the other stuffs

84
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,900
looking close to done so next slide

85
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,360
that's the status of other things that

86
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">we depend on that are not yet rfcs but</font>

87
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,460
you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a crapload of those</font>

88
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,200
are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the RFC editor queue in the sense</font>

89
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,390
that they are approved and just

90
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,289
basically blocked waiting for references

91
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:12,320
so once the rest of the stuff approves

92
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:16,490
you know the the the cluster from area

93
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,710

97
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:32,419

145
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:36,458
people who care kicked over to predict

146
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,700
art and music he merges into bundle and

147
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:41,919
there and wordsmith there<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh-huh so if</font>

148
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're hoping to see me and Magnus argue</font>

149
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,550
about our DP DX muxing you're in the

150
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:52,120
wrong place that will be somewhat other

151
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:53,469
time um so next slide ah so there was

152
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,350
some there were some questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

153
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,430
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> only things that said you should</font>

154
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,580
only do x-ray

155
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,469
only do why and whether like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

156
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether whether it was better to say</font>

157
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,050
them when they were meaningful and then

158
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,529
stop saying them or to say them

159
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:14,079
constantly for no obvious reason on so

160
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:15,640
on the on the due to some discuss some

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,260
discussion on list in some discussion by

162
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,230
the editors we concluded the right

163
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,959
answer was that for consistency and also

164
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,029
for simplicity that you basically only

165
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,829
said bundle only a<font color="#CCCCCC"> MUX only a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> em</font>

166
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:33,370
sections and there's and so however<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

167
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:36,520
do say on<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight on in this and the</font>

168
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:40,390
answer says bundle or box as the case

169
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,370
may be he doesn't say only ever on so on

170
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:46,330
this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> included as best thing to do</font>

171
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:48,580
and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done John I</font>

172
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:52,570
assume that's for the correct definition

173
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:56,380
of new which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> include recycled I yes</font>

174
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,850
okay yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically if there is a that</font>

175
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,020
the right way to think about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if</font>

176
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,310
there is actually some question about

177
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,720
whether this thing could be treated

178
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:08,670
differently we will tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

179
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:13,029
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we will not next slide um</font>

180
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:14,349
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the bundle theme I'm not sure if</font>

181
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,180
these are actually sorted by theme or

182
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,330
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way but this is</font>

183
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,660
how they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are on so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

184
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:26,020
question appeared about whether how I

185
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:29,230
should handle on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our attributes the only</font>

186
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:32,470
made sense for media sections like<font color="#E5E5E5"> RTC</font>

187
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,060
mocks but that appeared in situations

188
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,550
where you're a bundling the thing a

189
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,510
media section<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto a data section so one</font>

190
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,949
way that's going to happen is if you

191
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,270
start out by negotiating a data section

192
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,610
as you have the data session<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font>

193
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,850
negotiating you add say video<font color="#CCCCCC"> m line but</font>

194
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:49,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">you wish to bundle it onto the on you</font>

195
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,760
wish to bundle it<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the datum section</font>

196
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:54,760
um and I guess by us already box is

197
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,860
irrelevant but others<font color="#CCCCCC"> letarte on and so</font>

198
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,839
we say otherwise that these meet

199
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,089
specific these these transferred end of

200
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,380
attributes should only go on the thing

201
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:04,029
that is being bundled into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nowhere</font>

202
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,890
else but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just kind of goofy that</font>

203
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:08,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">there on the data section we concluded</font>

204
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,160
that goofy was better than non goofy and

205
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,170
so we should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

206
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,180
there's a bit as a discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

207
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,829
music list about this topic we I think

208
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,870
Paul kids of it being the rough but

209
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:20,388
finally being beaten down and agreeing

210
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,160
that we could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this um uh we will need</font>

211
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">to presume text updates in a variety of</font>

212
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,399
documents which will notice the last

213
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:27,889
call's we go forward noticing that says

214
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,019
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that contradict this arm but that</font>

215
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:39,290
was the way we did in<font color="#CCCCCC"> jsf with the plan</font>

216
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:42,550
that we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all right then right so</font>

217
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,959
in this case the editors folded on the

218
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:51,439
much discussion about how it happened in

219
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:54,560
cases where on I we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically say on</font>

220
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:57,439
the offer had offered ABC and the answer

221
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,239
had picked be on the j suspect

222
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:01,129
previously said at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were</font>

223
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,519
like could only do<font color="#CCCCCC"> B and you couldn't</font>

224
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:07,220
offer see and and and a riad right and

225
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,170
uh this<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't had to be simplicity um</font>

226
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,339
but apparently make people sad day had

227
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,589
situations where they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add them</font>

228
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,149
back it's permitted by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 days before so</font>

229
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:16,189
we weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we weren't</font>

230
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,680
doing anything goofy here by allowing it

231
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:19,939
on so we changed that back on but the

232
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,040
rule is you have to add them at the end

233
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:25,029
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm at the end is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pro</font>

234
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,769
stability of the negotiated mechanism uh

235
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:29,870
Jonathan<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it says you can who is the</font>

236
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:34,189
you and is there a if it's the browser

237
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:38,420
is there a prob for it I there is no

238
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:42,740
prob for it um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't believe um huh</font>

239
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:44,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">are you try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter yes so if it um I</font>

240
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,540
believe if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were the person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who is</font>

241
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,560
responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> removing it then set</font>

242
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,930
color preferences might have some effect

243
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,839
on however<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other person was that it</font>

244
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,899
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on so this should have a frog</font>

245
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">for it um on you as the person making</font>

246
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:05,600
the offer at this point no matter who

247
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:09,800
was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original offer answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no</font>

248
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,559
something's not okay so I so I guess

249
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,240
again my question is so what this is

250
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,500
saying is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you know even if</font>

251
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,480
the other guy rejected it you can put it

252
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,860
back but I you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that since the</font>

253
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,269
since that offer has to come from the

254
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,559
browser I as a JavaScript I've no way of

255
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:21,810
actually causing that to happen so I'm

256
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,579
not

257
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,140
sure to the other guy rejected but you

258
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,670
might have rejected it right yeah if I

259
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,380
rejected I can put it back the other guy

260
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,760
rejected it then either browser will

261
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,850
will not put it back depending on its

262
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,910
opinions<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can control now great if he</font>

263
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,460
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back you can take it out hahaha</font>

264
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,380
[Music]

265
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,150
and you can stop it what to you so let's

266
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,040
put it this way if the browser does

267
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,990
offer it if the browser the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

268
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,880
browser that offers it you can stop that

269
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:54,210
from happening but you can't do is make

270
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:55,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">it to it I guess what I would say is if</font>

271
00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:01,220
you wish there were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> frog for that you</font>

272
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:04,230
know where to go and is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

273
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:12,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">ain't w3c I didn't mean like like but</font>

274
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:14,310
down below uh-huh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is my last</font>

275

276
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:21,660
this ad thing is tiring um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right I</font>

277
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,700
think this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Colin just added exciting to do it um</font>

279
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,670
right on so right we're now allowing you

280
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,440
to on to do credit references and have

281
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,380
them to have them apply in the middle of

282
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,480
a thing as previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> my colloquy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bernard</font>

283
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,040
previously indicated um we didn't just

284
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,020
allow that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about it for a</font>

285
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,209
while glue to probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> work now we allow</font>

286
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:53,939
it um that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to say about</font>

287
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:55,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that right um camera raise this may be</font>

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,800
his whore old mate was / nard one of

289
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,500
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> junior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pickers um that uh that</font>

290
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,050
basically what happens when an API call

291
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,910
fails um and you know what what

292
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,349
guarantees do deliver and let me tell

293
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as someone who actually wrote these</font>

294
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:13,740
things the guarantees we really wanted

295
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:15,930
to liver were none um<font color="#CCCCCC"> boys the CC an</font>

296
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,690
undefined behavior but we eventually

297
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:21,060
after some drinking and coffee included

298
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,800
that really that wasn't very cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

299
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,689
it now says something the implementers

300
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,400
are going to hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure the people</font>

301
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,529
who do hurry this code it was a lot will

302
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,730
come come we later which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

303
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,170
these calls fail you have to go back to

304
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous tape so it has to be basing</font>

305
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,699
is if the thing never happened um yes

308
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,919
concluded that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you knows what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his things</font>

00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:50,519
right priority of constituencies

[Music]

364
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:38,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">doubt I'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sober enough to do that</font>

365
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:43,220
but I'll see what I can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> on hand ok ok</font>

366
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">let us return to our agenda which sue us</font>

367
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,280
you're gonna have to stall a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

368
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:58,850
I've seen your draft um is this example

369
00:18:49,280 --> 00:19:05,300
yeah yes hey man sure you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

370
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:14,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">read all the examples like huh all right</font>

371
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:14,740
I don't well that was interesting

372
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,668
discovered but preview closes the wrong

373
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,890
window if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you press the button that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

374
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:45,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">closed window</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll see if we can do open</font>

375
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:48,549
recent ok this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Easter Mike</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok shortly</font>

376
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:52,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok this is for the stp example staffed</font>

377
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:55,029
and I have this next slide show yeah we

378
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,830
know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is about trying to come</font>

379
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:59,230
up with some examples that uses Jessup

380
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">and try to be as close to Jessup as</font>

381
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,000
possible in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stp construction</font>

382
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:06,279
and it provides someone who is trying to

383
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,630
read how the stp is used some references

384
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,270
to artificer that they can figure out

385
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:13,809
how a particular part in sdp is used

386
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:16,809
next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened between 0 to</font>

387
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:18,940
10 for ocean so 03 was just an update to

388
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:20,830
the ocean<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it was expiring so 04</font>

389
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,590
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing where a lot of things went</font>

390
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">in so we like Cullen had presented an</font>

391
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,699
idea of 96 cup of open issues on how

392
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,470
some of the identical<font color="#CCCCCC"> on category and</font>

393
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,679
transport category<font color="#CCCCCC"> attribute should</font>

394
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,750
appear in stp and a gist of 19 and of

395
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,789
clarifies every of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so</font>

396
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,789
that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we closed all those open</font>

397
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:41,770
issues and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jessup 19 also</font>

398
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:46,210
explains about how we interrupt with

399
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:48,309
legacy offers like which has RTP AVP but

400
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,529
with a fingerprint how to kind of take

401
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:53,408
that as a DT less srtp so that's clear

402
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:56,140
as well and a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> edition that had that</font>

403
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:58,419
was added was to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS ID for the</font>

404
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,370
offers and ancestors added and then one

405
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:03,580
example has been added to also show how

406
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,168
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use identity attribute in stp apart</font>

407
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,270
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that new edition that happened was</font>

408
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:09,909
we created in<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sdp attributes</font>

409
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,350
checklist appendix that way what it

410
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:14,080
basically does is it go it went through

411
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,899
J sub section J sub section 5 and

412
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,120
compiled list of requirements that we

413
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:21,879
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stp attributes in the example</font>

414
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:26,620
should match so this was basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

415
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:28,690
so that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can align to Jessup 19 so so</font>

416
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,840
right now the summaries that we are very

417
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">close to watches of 19 says</font>

418
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,550
that's it so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question for GF is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

419
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,459
are we ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> working a plastic all</font>

420
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:41,940
so we got a very extensive review from

421
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,730
Hulk is about a the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font>

422
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,050
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a comment yeah just</font>

423
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,820
nine times in question for clarification

424
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:53,700
you said very close does that mean you

425
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:57,929
