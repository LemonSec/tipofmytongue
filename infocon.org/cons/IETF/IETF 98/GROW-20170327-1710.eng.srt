00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:16,619
for one of the two aha so John will do

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:20,189
one notes John okay great<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jabba scribe</font>

3
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:22,170
excellent sorry it flashed so quickly I

4
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,400
couldn't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so now we just need</font>

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,960
note taker you can take notes in a text

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,650
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> and email them to me you can use</font>

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:39,660
the crazy collaborative thing on the web

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:41,339
if you like emails fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> Heasley</font>

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">excellent thank you very much so we have</font>

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,550
notes thicker and generous<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christ we</font>

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,379
start we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have our obligatory note well</font>

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:55,140
you haven't read it you haven't probably

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:01:06,210
been to a meeting yet so the agenda is

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:10,410
not projecting right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's self</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> self</font>

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:14,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">described mean so we have a presentation</font>

16
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">on open BMP and a few new proposed work</font>

17
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:23,670
items on BMP again and finally job will

18
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:26,990
present session polling we have document

19
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,030
status so we inadvertently submitted the

20
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:33,750
large communities usage for publication

21
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,670
a little early but I think it's ready so

22
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,880
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for last call to</font>

23
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,800
happen and that'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get submitted pretty</font>

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,789
much all our outstanding documents are

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:49,470
now done so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP reject has been</font>

26
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">submitted add paths is in the editor q I</font>

27
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,130
guess we do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a g-shot we think is</font>

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:59,239
likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get resurrected quite shortly</font>

29
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:05,160
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> without further ado we'll start with</font>

30
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:12,420
open BMP presentation that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right Randy</font>

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:15,829
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Randy and circle it wet all right as</font>

32
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,829
long as it's in tune so

33
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:24,890
nope sorry you have to be in the pink

34
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:30,390
square please<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to pink square colony</font>

35
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:33,829
hello you can if he's awake the problem

36
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,829
is this puts us in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the screen</font>

37
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:44,819
Randy no I got a clip<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay anyway I'm</font>

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:49,739
Randy we've met before this is circle

39
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:52,768
Francisco and over<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is Tim there um</font>

40
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:56,010
kind of users also<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are not</font>

41
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:59,700
implementers they've implemented open

42
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,329
bgp open BMP and we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you</font>

43
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,359
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it this is the nutshell</font>

44
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:12,510
think about Ralph use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk except</font>

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:17,010
for BMP not bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok collector but they've</font>

46
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:24,540
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sexy GUI glued on top of it which</font>

47
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:28,730
lets you do some nice analytics and here

48
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,730
are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples will take us through</font>

49
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:38,250
so so based on the data we collect

50
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,989
through a BMP I think you probably need

51
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">to speak a little closer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic so</font>

52
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:45,299
everybody in the back can hear and

53
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:49,590
online<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it can hear me alright so</font>

54
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:52,829
through the data we collect using<font color="#E5E5E5"> BMP we</font>

55
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:57,569
can do several visualisations to make it

56
00:03:52,829 --> 00:04:00,000
easier for operators to see what kind of

57
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:03,780
a session we've established what are the

58

enabled capabilities all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

59
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:11,579
we can deduce from the pier up messages

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:14,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is exchanged through BNP there are</font>

61
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,560
other things we can look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font>

which<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers they are coming from we can</font>

65
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,710
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the history of a prefix how it's</font>

66
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,169
been changing what are the changes are

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mention</font>

68
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:37,498
these are just a simple set of things we

69
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,629
did with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data available they were</font>

00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:43,229
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> low hanging fruit that we could</font>

71
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:46,680
immediately visualized<font color="#E5E5E5"> and show but we</font>

72
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:50,219
have access to data that's coming from

74
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:56,460

75
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:59,249
unlimited number of use cases you can do

76
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:03,150
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google but also using the</font>

can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the peering link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font>

80
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:16,650
prefixes received and then we do a pre

81
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,068
and post comparison how many prefixes

82
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:22,409
are filtered out you can incorporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe</font>

IQ geolocation data if you want to I

84
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:29,069
realize not everybody cares about it and

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:33,449
of course Brandi<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the mandatory</font>

86
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:36,149
world map which is always fun so these

00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:39,569
are basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the peers we have been</font>

00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:41,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting the PMP data about from you can</font>

89
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:44,550
see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are seven routers in the</font>

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:54,120
through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are able to monitor 733</font>

92
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:57,479

93
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:02,219
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> available on various when their</font>

the earlier implementers that since 13 3

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,080
after we finished just getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMP</font>

99
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,229
data putting in a database and doing

some analytics and displaying one of the

101
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,659
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we part would be really cool is</font>

102
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:34,169
that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the open BMP software</font>

103
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:37,110
but you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own vgp feeds we</font>

104
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,330
thought well route views and ripe have

105
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,159
been collecting publicly available be

106
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">gypped data and making it available to</font>

107
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:47,849
everyone it's an mrt formatted<font color="#E5E5E5"> data but</font>

108
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:50,759
what if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just took the MRT formatted</font>

109
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:53,188
bgp data from route views and convert it

110
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,259
to BMP and feed it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> our system which</font>

111
00:06:53,189 --> 00:07:00,839
basically understands the BMP messages

112
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:04,649
and parses them so we can see you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

113
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,689
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best path as seen by route views and</font>

114
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:10,949
since then we have implemented getting

115
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:13,499
the data from ripe as well and then you

116
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:16,349
can do several different types of

117
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:18,389
analysis using the data coming publicly

118
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:20,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">available including looking at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

119
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,349
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own prefixes and see what they look</font>

120
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,389
like in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the internet from</font>

121
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:31,799
different peering points that crowd

122
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:34,559
views or right has please this one to me

123
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:39,149
is interesting because the dark side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

124
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:43,649
this story is why feed route views into

125
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:46,889
a fake BMP and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

126
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:54,029
giving this project enough BMP feeds

127
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:56,249
right why do I want BMP is not to see

128
00:07:54,029 --> 00:08:00,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">ralph use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have lots of tools for that</font>

129
00:07:56,249 --> 00:08:04,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see what's input on the input</font>

side<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is a symptom of a</font>

131
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:11,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem there's another part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

132
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:14,610
problem which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feeding</font>

133
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:20,669
BNP visits and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

134
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:27,839
implicate implementations are shall we

135
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:34,438
say not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best so why we're here is to</font>

136
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:40,169
try to get feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> about BMP about open</font>

137
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:44,149
BMP but also about what we want from BMP

138
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:50,389
from the implementers at the vendors

139
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:50,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay Tim encircle and I our users</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

140
00:08:50,899 --> 00:09:01,769
so I just want to do a side shot

141
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:05,459
which is while we're early in the BMP

142
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:08,880
process and the open BMP project which

143
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:12,029
is a collector like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ralph using risk and</font>

144
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,310
probably Ralph using risk will also

145
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:17,370
start to BBMP collectors down the pipe

146
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:20,459
who knows that we have the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

147
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:25,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ralph views and risk that we don't know</font>

148
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:28,018
what kind of feed we are getting like is

149
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,019
that feed in refuse what you're showing

150
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:35,760
your customer or what you're showing

151
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:38,550
your peer or a fully internal dump so

152
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,800
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> this draft that said what</font>

153
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:44,399
communion how to tag it with communities

154
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:48,060
to tell the collectors what you're

155
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,029
giving and I think we might want this

156
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,310
before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start scaling collection we</font>

157
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,519
made the mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Ralph use and risk</font>

158
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:59,010
not saying hey we only want full teams

159
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,940
or we only want for your feeds or we

160
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:11,880
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark guess you hope it's another</font>

161
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:15,000
good use of coolers ok so are the specs

162
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:19,320
and implementations what we want go for

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,329
you are you joke sliders NZT are you

164
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,600
sure this is a good use of communities I

165
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:26,339
don't know because we've got plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

166
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,260
bad uses of communities whatever there I

167
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,240
found there may be two approaches to

168
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,069
this I could mark what I sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but</font>

169
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,050
then you don't see what I'm not saying I

170
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:44,250
cannot use communities to signal what

171
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:47,729
I'm not sending to you down hombre no no

172
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:50,430
I'd be perfectly happy if the there's a

173
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,740
web page on the collector that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font>

174
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,890
connect first connect to what you say

175
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,019
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of feed i'm giving you</font>

176
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:00,480
don't care let's not go down that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font>

177
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,610
suggest it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

178
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,130
not really discussing this draft right

179
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:10,110
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need to before we scale</font>

180
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,450
BBMP collectors we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to repeat</font>

181
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:17,430
the mistake what hack wii

182
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:19,380
that's up for grabs right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay are the</font>

183
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,589
specs and implementations what we want

184
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,890
and I think not and you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

185
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:29,850
the next two<font color="#E5E5E5"> um what we really wants</font>

186
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:39,720
more data and and so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

187
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:43,340
kind of a Venn diagram of it and um he's

188
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,340
on going to get a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> with drew see</font>

189
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:53,969
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong slide these are the</font>

190
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,920
slides you sent us no I can't do i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

191
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,710
i got those these should be the nuance

192
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,319
it isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay with a mistake</font>

193
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,360
there's a cat slide it's missing Lucy

194
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:10,800
said my presentation had to have a

195
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:16,730
capsule and it's missing something fail

196
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:20,729
so anyway there's a project overview

197
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:27,540
there's you can run your own thing from

198
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">ralphs use data and um maybe get</font>

199
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,270
together for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ball tonight or a beer</font>

200
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:39,890
beer bath or whatever we call it I

201
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:42,600
forget after<font color="#E5E5E5"> this before you have to do</font>

202
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:55,380
that the one with the cat video Thank

203
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">cutting it oh Jesus in major failure i'm</font>

204
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,120

205
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,690

206
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,760
because i'm really not that social and

207
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:12,420
these things that but i know so many

208
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:14,780
people here<font color="#CCCCCC"> too in warm so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minds</font>

209
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,780
that work

210
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:58,250
yep which we mr.

211
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,399
you

212
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,750
yes

213
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right okay it's me again so Tim and</font>

214
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:45,709
I and Paolo have been working on

215
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:48,380
collecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp data using BMP under the</font>

216
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:51,369
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source project open BMP as randy</font>

217
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:54,740
and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> just presented a while ago and</font>

218
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:57,620
during this word we have come to realize

219
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:00,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there are some cases where we'd</font>

220
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,950
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see BMP send us more data than</font>

221
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:08,990
what is presently available so currently

222
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the BMP RFC we have access to the</font>

223
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:16,220
adjacent<font color="#CCCCCC"> rib in from the router we have</font>

224
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:20,630
access to pre and post policy basically

225
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:22,760
anything that the pier sends us we sense

226
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,040
to the router where the BMP is running

227
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,610
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see those updates which is</font>

228
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,699
wonderful<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we can also see after</font>

229
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:35,750
the import policies filters etc have

230
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:40,160
been applied<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is what's available</font>

231
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:43,310
today in / RFC what we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

232
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> extend the access to the</font>

233
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:49,430
other ribs conceptual ribs of the router

234
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,250
what we're recommending we have two

235
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:56,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">different drafts in the first one we're</font>

236
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:59,209
suggesting that BNP can also send us the

237
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:02,420
local rib routes and how that's

238
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:06,410
different from the adjacency rib in post

239
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:08,719
is that you may have same prefix past

240
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:11,779
the import policy coming from multiple

241
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,120
peers but you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know which</font>

242
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:17,390
one is selected by the router to be

243
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,730
installed in the local rep similarly you

244
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:22,610
might have some other routes that make

245
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,160
it into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> local rib perhaps even</font>

246
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,200
without the BGP peering session which we

247
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,959
will talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about the use</font>

248
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:35,300
cases where this requirement this neat

249
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:39,260
came from adjacency rib out is after you

250
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,699
know you q your packets to be advertised

251
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,100
to your peers

252
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,990
what you are sending especially on the

253
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,360
edge of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

254
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,270
let the Polo and Tim talk a little bit

255
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:55,820
about the use cases where these

256
00:16:50,270 --> 00:17:01,280
requirements sort of stemmed from<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

257
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:03,950
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Paulo so we have divided it in</font>

258
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,829
local rib and other about but a little

259
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,410
bit it's you know it stands also for

260
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:14,089
both of them some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

261
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:16,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say so among the use cases we</font>

262
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:18,740
have for the local rate the monitor the

263
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,619
roots selected and used by the by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

264
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,859
router right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the case of</font>

265
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:28,010
ecmp and of course with the odds rib in

266
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:30,379
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot factor in older that</font>

267
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,810
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp and things like</font>

268
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:36,200
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so essentially you don't have</font>

269
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:40,940
reliable ecmp or you don't have ecmp

270
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,910
information over there of course a the

271
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:47,330
other challenger to ecmp<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's of course</font>

272
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:51,500
also bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> up pots right and i am the one</font>

273
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:54,230
that in naga in bellevue 2014 was

274
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:59,390
advocating was doing a presentation p.m.

275
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:04,100
CT plus netflix and was<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a path for</font>

276
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:06,530
you know precisely ecmp but what i was

277
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,800
saying in that presentation is that you

278
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:13,940
know 2014 still the year of let's say

279
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:17,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">add path and maybe 2015 will be the one</font>

280
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:21,080
of bmp4 doing precisely that and if

281
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:23,330
anybody you know i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very curious</font>

282
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,629
if any<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody in this audience has ever</font>

283
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:30,260
used add paths for you know ecmp

284
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:33,880
monitoring and i would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak to</font>

285
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:36,350
you because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i found several</font>

286
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,390
very much challenges in doing that so i

287
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:41,330
would totally be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward for</font>

288
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,190
gimpy to cover this case the second

289
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is the next stop preservation this</font>

290
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:48,860
is an easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> one ever say and this would</font>

291
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:52,100
also apply to edge without right so it's

292
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,439
like you know the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic changes as</font>

293
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,570
you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need from books</font>

294
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,110
one table to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and so it's it</font>

295
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,939
would be very interesting for any sort

296
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:08,149
of debugging purposes and things like

297
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:11,330
that screen to get you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

298
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:14,658
stop at any given point and then you

299
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:17,000
know my DNA it's in net flow IP fix

300
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:19,429
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote this PM assista</font>

301
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,799
collector open source free<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever and</font>

302
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:25,429
then I have the problem that with the

303
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:28,549
BMP I cannot correlate you know what I

304
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:31,970
get from BNP with a drip in with the net

305
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:35,299
flow and IP fix right and it is a little

306
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:37,429
bit you know bad the situation that if

307
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,769
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a multi-vendor network like the</font>

308
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:45,559
one of entity communications for which

309
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:47,419
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you want to see what</font>

310
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,370
people is advertising you and you are

311
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:51,830
throwing out you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correlate</font>

312
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,330
against net flow and the IP fix and then

313
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,029
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see also what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

314
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,759
advertising to the piers right and then

315
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:02,350
you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick up to three of the four</font>

316
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:07,340
the four being you know screen scraping

317
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:09,500
netcom bgp and BMP and why instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

318
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing all of these not having just you</font>

319
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,700
know making you know to use the words of

320
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:19,039
one president may be NP great not the

321
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">game but just make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it great for the</font>

322
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,769
first time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's that's</font>

323
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,539
that's it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course policy in</font>

324
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:28,909
verification rightly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

325
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:32,029
policies with bgp so it would be nice at

326
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:34,490
every stage you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> to verify that the</font>

327
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:35,990
policies have the accuracy<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have the</font>

330
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,428
Audrey bout<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say i was already</font>

331
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,950
mentioning it and it's very intuitive

332
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:48,409
and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know checking</font>

333
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,259
what you are advertising to pierce

334
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:53,539
imaging any I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even as the end</font>

335
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:57,049
solution in which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any pgp</font>

336
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:59,450
traffic engineering you want to close

337
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,610
the feedback loop and see what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

338
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,309
actually advertising to people so that

339
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,330
you can modify your advertisement in a

340
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:10,129
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

341
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:13,639
so we and it I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight a</font>

342
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,870
little bit also I'm gonna step talk

343
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:20,410
about a microphone to make sure

344
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:23,989
everybody so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as monitoring the</font>

345
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,550
local rib in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft we do talk about</font>

346
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,700
how you can also do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different way</font>

347
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,919
in the current way to do it the way to

348
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,600
get this information which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a major</font>

349
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem for us is the local originated</font>

350
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,399
data which the<font color="#CCCCCC"> current draft does talk</font>

351
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:39,020
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> locally originated data BTW pls is</font>

352
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,340
our biggest driving factor for this

353
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:45,230
local rib advertisement or enablement

354
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,790
because BTW pls has<font color="#E5E5E5"> EPE which is locally</font>

355
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,460
originated but then BTW pls also

356
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:51,290
distributes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want to have to</font>

357
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,820
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP peering in order to collect that</font>

358
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:58,430
data so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect the data</font>

359
00:21:52,820 --> 00:22:00,470
locally from the actual device there are

360
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,990
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> use cases where there is no beach</font>

361
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">appearing either for instance we have</font>

362
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:10,340
BRF s and you have peering with envy<font color="#CCCCCC"> RSV</font>

363
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,870
are not actually doing adjacency<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrew</font>

364
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">bonding or if you just have BRF sand you</font>

365
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,300
just have static routes or whatever else

366
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,830
it's still hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> I originated so let's</font>

367
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,639
still want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data to represent</font>

368
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,639
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> running tables for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

369
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:26,000
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is cut off so that's</font>

370
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:32,000
kind of a bummer but the locally<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

371
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:35,090
can move<font color="#CCCCCC"> it over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so these are</font>

372
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,790
the changes that we've made to the

373
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,780
drafter to update it so one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

374
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,580
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain</font>

375
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:44,030
backwards compatibility and we want to

376
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:47,360
reuse the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flags and the pure hitter so</font>

377
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:49,670
to do that we are introducing a new type

378
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,939
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's type 3 for the peering there is</font>

379
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:56,300
it some other peer types so we figure

380
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,400
this would fit fine flags are also going

381
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,950
to be specific to the pier type right

382
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,830
now there it's not really specified if

383
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,990
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually specific / pierre type</font>

384
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,840
since all the flags are currently used

385
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:12,230
by all types but this is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific</font>

386
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,419
we have outlined<font color="#CCCCCC"> very specific flags for</font>

387
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,580
this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer type one of them is</font>

388
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,870
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> f flag to indicate that the local</font>

389
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,370
rib<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're actually seeing is</font>

390
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually going to be filtered or</font>

391
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,459
could be potentially filtered so we want

392
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we getting a true state or</font>

393
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,990
if we're not getting a true state if

394
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,460
we're not we don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> why but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font>

395
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know that we're just we can't trust</font>

396
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">it we're leveraging the existing stats</font>

397
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,159
so what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the current</font>

398
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,840
draft is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually says local rib and</font>

399
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:44,300
it doesn't specify adjacency rib in pre

400
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,860
versus post it just says local ribs so

401
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,680
since the stats are already there we're

402
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,678
just going to leverage those stats and

403
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:56,120
these are purrpurr so all stats are

404
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,340
conveyed up with her pure header we want

405
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,949
to update or basically replace the

406
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,780
current section 82<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says locally</font>

407
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,540
originated since that's a little

408
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:08,270
confusing and we're pretty much doing

409
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:10,428
roughly the same taken that and in

410
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:14,690
building upon it and redefining it a

411
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:16,700
little bit more in the local riffraff we

412
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,040
also want to add another tlv for the

413
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,960
info messages when we get the peer out

414
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,070
message we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the vrf name or</font>

415
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,990
the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> name that the pier represents</font>

416
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this can actually be used</font>

417
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">for other peer types as well even though</font>

418
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,170
we're calling it out in a local rib but

419
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:35,690
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a need for us to</font>

420
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,470
know which pier this belongs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we get</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the rd but we don't really know what</font>

table or<font color="#CCCCCC"> vrf it actually belongs to you</font>

423
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,670
without having to pull in config data

424
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:49,100
which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do um the</font>

425
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,990
second drop changes is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rib adjacency</font>

426
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,570
out this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really change much</font>

427
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:56,480
except for<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding a new flag which</font>

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,230
versus out for backwards compatibility

430
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:04,760
we're just using a new bits and they're

431
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,530
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits is going to be you know</font>

432
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously positive for adjacency rib out</font>

433
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,720
but we believe since<font color="#CCCCCC"> Paolo myself and</font>

434
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,480
will pretty much know everybody who's

435
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:18,050
been implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> BNP shouldn't have a</font>

436
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,780
problem with that new flag fine we're

437
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,280
adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> new statistic types so that we</font>

438
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,280
can actually collect the information for

439
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,260
the adjacency rib and rip<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so these</font>

440
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,690
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same standard types that you see</font>

441
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:32,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">now for adjacency rib in we just want to</font>

442
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,240
add that for the out

443
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:40,780
so those are basically the changes that

444
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:43,150
were introduced in there are any

445
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,340
questions we can discuss them now or if

446
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,110
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are interested in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> topic we're</font>

447
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,520
going to have a bar after the session at

448
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:54,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar we'd love to hear some feedback</font>

449
00:25:50,520 --> 00:26:02,100
either about the drafts or open the MP

450
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:02,100
project she's surely bush from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> J oh</font>

451
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:13,290
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual around it's a</font>

452
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:15,668
representation it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what's</font>

453
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:18,280
represented the<font color="#CCCCCC"> implementation maybe</font>

454
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:20,950
they what's wrong yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I've</font>

455
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:23,440
smoked that stuff too but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

456
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:30,580
and measure routers you'll find that

457
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:34,809
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you get part of so on so be</font>

458
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:37,110
sure you specify what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really want</font>

459
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:37,110
here

460
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">robert kashyap so looking at your use</font>

461
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:48,409
cases I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a killing that you not only</font>

462
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,990
want local rib but also a lockout<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit</font>

463
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:53,210
because those are not the same in local

464
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,490
r if you have multiple producers which

465
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,700
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the same in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tip tip does the</font>

466
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,529
local refusion in number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> platforms</font>

467
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,870
plus the routing rib doesn't guarantee

468
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:04,610
that it's in data plane and good VG p

469
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:08,719
actually advertises only what is in the

470
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,979
data plane so i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if local rate</font>

471
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,360
versus local tip have you actually

472
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:16,340
thought about one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other um we we</font>

473
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,658
thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but we didn't right now</font>

474
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,870
we're focusing on control<font color="#E5E5E5"> planes out of</font>

475
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:22,370
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we figured it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be more to be</font>

476
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,928
added if we were to actually start

477
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,340
looking at the data plane side or the 14

478
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:27,770
points because then it starts to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

479
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:30,980
the hashing as well as is exactly how

480
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:32,600
certain things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being forwarded we're</font>

481
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,690
using other mechanisms for monitoring

482
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,689
that but yeah

483
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:50,850
John's gutter hi so I read both drafts

484
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,530
and I think they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed fine i</font>

485
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,810
have a bunch of comments for you but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

486
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to translate them from sharpie into</font>

487
00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:02,190
email so i'll give them to you in a day

488
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,980
or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i had one thing that i did</font>

489
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,930
want to bring up though which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one</font>

490
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,800
of the two drafts you say something

491
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:12,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">about but state compression and you say</font>

492
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:17,760
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do state compression and</font>

493
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:21,419
please don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that because it's it's</font>

494
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,890
basically I would be happy to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

495
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">convince you either here at the mic or</font>

496
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:28,170
you know later that<font color="#E5E5E5"> an implementation</font>

497
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,590
that isn't allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a state</font>

498
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,270
compression towards EMP is basically an

499
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,939
implementation that is required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail</font>

500
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:40,680
if the BMP collector decides to run

501
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,900
slowly so I mean I I assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your</font>

502
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,300
motivation for putting that sentence in

503
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,360
there was to say like please<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

504
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,909
state compression gratuitous like Tom

505
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,860
which that would be fine to say because

506
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,800
I'm not aware of any implementations

507
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,870
that do occur to us Liam yeah so we

508
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,720
can't speak for you know other

509
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,540
collectors we do aim though to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

510
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,420
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our collector is not the bottleneck</font>

511
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:09,360
from the router so from that perspective

512
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,530
that's for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not a problem but</font>

513
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,139
the users that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

514
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:16,760
are the people who consume and use open

515
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">BMP or people we've been talking to you</font>

516
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,950
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> with BG pls or any of the igp</font>

517
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,419
information they want every event they

518
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,450
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now it is state compressed</font>

519
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,460
even with<font color="#E5E5E5"> BG pls being distributed they</font>

520
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,560
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if the local rib has been</font>

521
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,960
changed and if it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been changed they</font>

522
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,280
want to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor it so that's why</font>

523
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">we kind of called out if statement</font>

524
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,430
compression was being used i think i put

525
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,500
in there was like one second and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

526
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:43,290
that's what we produced BTW pls to as

527
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,480
well as one second granularity but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

528
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,240
then a lot can<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen and we don't know</font>

529
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,650
what happened right so that that one

530
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,320
second thing was what had me scratching

531
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,700
my head which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm i'm not aware of</font>

532
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,550
the details of everybody's

533
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,610
implementation

534
00:29:54,550 --> 00:30:00,909
but ours doesn't do anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

535
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:02,889
at all um so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we maybe have to</font>

536
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:05,350
have a longer conversation yeah we can

537
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:12,010
define it better so that it's clearly

538
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:14,320
articulated yeah right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so i</font>

539
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,300
guess to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a comment John for the</font>

540
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,360
motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> putting that in the draft</font>

541
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:21,909
is that as the collector as the user we

542
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,770
want to get as much data as possible as

543
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,450
fast as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can especially people are</font>

544
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:27,850
going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stn type of</font>

545
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,830
implementations sure and I want you to

546
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,149
have that and I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> want every man</font>

547
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:41,409
woman and child in this room to have a

548
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:44,200
pony but you know very good I'm not

549
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to ask for Kenny oh hi you go</font>

550
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:51,220
yahoo so we've gone down this rabbit

551
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:52,860
hole with a couple vendors speak when I

552
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,600
think what you're looking for is also

553
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,879
local it because if you're looking for

554
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,510
all possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp routes you could get</font>

555
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,820
beachy pdu he steps a little closer so

556
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you are looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get easy and pure</font>

557
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">out which was specifically our use case</font>

558
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:11,230
you may get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP view of the local</font>

559
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:13,540
routes kinda<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorta because you're going</font>

560
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get the non recursive resolution one</font>

561
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,399
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually know the router is</font>

562
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:20,110
going to do a push the resolution or not

563
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">justify an implementation also you don't</font>

564
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:25,870
know whether the PGP view the local rib

565
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:28,690
says something but then other views say

566
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:30,100
do something else you get ecmp you still

567
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,830
won't get the full picture would look

568
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:35,169
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> so with that particular use case</font>

569
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:37,210
how we've solved that or how we look

570
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,290
into that is we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the BGP next</font>

571
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,500
hops and as long as we have them

572
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:43,659
unmodified we can do BTW pls and we

573
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,390
compare that together so we can iterate

574
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:49,750
through that to see the ecmp down to the

575
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:52,090
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hops we still don't have the fifth</font>

576
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:55,660
we're not saying it is either that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

577
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,949
we do get it with PG pls would you marry

578
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,560
that did you look at that did you look

579
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,180
at looking at both yes we have and then

580
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,520
you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be compatible with</font>

581
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,019
every release off given vendor software

582
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:09,000
for exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they're going to remarry</font>

583
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:12,019
which they may or may not or may do it

584
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,850
at a certain time granularity or may not

585
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:17,700
just saying that this is you can't rely

586
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:20,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">on local rib plus being kill us to give</font>

587
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,399
you the answer you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably will not</font>

588
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:27,179
have a choice but end up tapping the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FIB</font>

589
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:31,678
so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to create a EMP fib</font>

590
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:33,480
which lit up with one better to do maybe

591
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,429
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should just go for the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

592
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:42,950
right then and there but there's another

593
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:42,950
draft there for local then yeah probably

594
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:52,830
ok so this working group did the

595
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,450
original BMP work so my assumption is

596
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:57,899
that this work does belong in our

597
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:59,850
working group and i believe the authors

598
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:03,360
would like this work adopted as a

599
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:05,340
working group item so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just have</font>

600
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,250
a show of hands and who thinks this work

601
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:12,350
should become a working group item here

602
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:16,289
in favor please raise your hand yeah

603
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:18,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pierre posed yeah ok that's sort of what</font>

604
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:21,690
we expected of course as always we'll

605
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:27,149
take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the mailing list and go from</font>

606
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:32,159
there um<font color="#CCCCCC"> dessert Randy emotional energy</font>

607
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:35,820
doesn't involve more prolonged war yes

608
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,580
so I will consult with the 80s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

609
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,678
eye dr chairs but we did do open we did

610
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:44,000
do the original BMP spec in this working

611
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:49,110
group and there wasn't any objection so

612
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,389
I leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I leave it open to discussing</font>

613
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:57,000
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the eye dr chairs and if</font>

614
00:33:51,389 --> 00:34:05,340
there's a problem then uh yeah well

615
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:12,619
we'll discuss it so yeah yep so it we

616
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:12,619
can do the work so yeah oh yeah

617
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,599
next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a job</font>

618
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:34,500
my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joe Snyder's I work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ntt</font>

619
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:36,719
communications and today i would like to

620
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,270
present to you some work we're doing to

621
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:46,020
standardize the concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp session</font>

622
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:50,089
calling you do the trick so the slide

623
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,089
skip not on this one

624
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,710
we worked long and hard on these slides

625
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:34,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it would be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shame if there's ten</font>

626
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:36,800
percent missing on the left side nice we

627
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:44,540
describe engineering in three words it's

628
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:48,859
close enough this document outlines an

629
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:51,800
approach to try and mitigate negative

630
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:54,710
impacts due to maintenance this can be

631
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,950
maintenance either on the ISP side or

632
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:02,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ixp side and we'll go through two</font>

633
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:05,660
examples in the slides the conceptual

634
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:09,050
ideas that the bgp sessions are torn

635
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,990
down before you do the actual work on a

636
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:15,140
lower layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and by ensuring that</font>

637
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:17,359
bgp sessions are torn down you give a

638
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,660
hint to the routers and say go start

639
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:23,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">path on saying go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go reconvert next</font>

640
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:26,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please you have it okay you know</font>

641
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it works why we are undertaking</font>

642
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:35,359
this effort now in 2014<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hargrave</font>

643
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:38,089
presented this idea at a ripe working

644
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:41,270
group meeting and since then<font color="#E5E5E5"> various</font>

645
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:43,609
IXPs have used this mythology with great

646
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:45,170
success so having some years of

647
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:48,020
experience in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field we figure it's</font>

648
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:51,800
good to standardize it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document</font>

649
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:53,780
so it becomes referenceable and then we

650
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,619
can promote the idea further by just

651
00:36:53,780 --> 00:37:00,080
pointing people at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document in the</font>

652
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:02,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">documents we outline two approaches</font>

653
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:07,520
there is voluntary<font color="#E5E5E5"> tear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down and</font>

654
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:10,040
involuntary<font color="#E5E5E5"> tear down voluntary is a</font>

655
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,030
trivial straightforward effort that we

656
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,440
use today everywhere but we've not

657
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,900
popularized it and

658
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,080
off in my opinion an involuntary might

659
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:25,630
be new<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some of you and is a rampant</font>

660
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:28,520
layering violation both of these methods

661
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,950
ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> btp sessions are torn down</font>

662
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and thus the rican virgins events kick</font>

663
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:37,430
in so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a typical ixp</font>

664
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:40,430
typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP is usually composed of</font>

665
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:42,589
multiple switches and you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

666
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:45,859
switches and over the fabric you speak

667
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:48,350
bgp with each other now it is not these

668
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,600
examples also apply to the case where

669
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:53,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is an intermediate provider</font>

670
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,640
between the two bgp speakers such as in

671
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,980
the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of for instance remote hearing</font>

672
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,830
or that you purchased a local loop of

673
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:03,140
sorts so we use I XP as an example but

674
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:09,110
it's really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> any layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

675
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:12,200
environments with voluntary session tear

676
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:17,260
down the idea is that you just type in

677
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:20,600
neighbor ip-address shut down enter and

678
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:23,600
this to some of you this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new to</font>

679
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:26,420
others it may be if you look at an IXP

680
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,089
if the port goes down connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

681
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,820
router your router router has the

682
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:34,070
interface link down event and it can

683
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:37,370
immediately start reconverting and if

684
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:41,450
you use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like bgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pic you might</font>

685
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:43,549
even convert quite fast however the guys

686
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:46,580
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fabric do not</font>

687
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:50,210
see the link going down so from their

688
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:52,850
perspective it might take<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9280 seconds</font>

689
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:55,360
before they notify notice that the

690
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:58,819
session<font color="#CCCCCC"> is done and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only then they start</font>

691
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,700
reconverting so by promoting the concept

692
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:04,160
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> shutdown bgp sessions before you do</font>

693
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:07,939
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your router will prevent a</font>

694
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,399
certain black hole scenarios and and

695
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:17,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is super obvious but it's not</font>

696
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:20,660
documented anywhere and now a<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

697
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:25,060
exciting example the let's move to

698
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:27,740
involuntary tera naam if on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I XP at</font>

699
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,169
one of the core switches somebody wants

700
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do maintenance</font>

701
00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:35,029
neither side will see their interfaces

702
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,759
go down because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a switch in the</font>

703
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:41,959
middle and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this food symbolizes the</font>

704
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:44,419
maintenance so under normal

705
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:48,618
circumstances if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> take no precautions</font>

706
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:51,589
and you do maintenance on that switch in

707
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:53,749
the middle then both sides will need to

708
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:57,159
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for their BGP whole timers to</font>

709
00:39:53,749 --> 00:40:00,738
expire which can take anywhere between

710
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:04,159
1980 seconds and then they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

711
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:06,890
start reconverting which may or may not

712
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:11,150
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast there are still people that use</font>

713
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:13,158
the like amex 80s at internet exchanges

714
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,559
and if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really unlucky it might</font>

715
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:19,130
take up to 10 15 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> before they are</font>

716
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:23,029
properly reconvert so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

717
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:28,339
disruptive maintenance procedure if you

718
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:32,209
if you work in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle now with</font>

719
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:36,199
involuntary session tear down what the

720
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:39,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">ixp operator does is they deploy a layer</font>

721
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:41,839
free layer for ACL in the middle on the

722
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:47,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">equipment that is about to be affected</font>

723
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:49,699
and this ACL has a source IP address the

724
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:52,009
peering land prefix as destination IP

725
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:57,640
addresses also the peering land prefix

726
00:40:52,009 --> 00:41:02,179
and it matches on port 179 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp port</font>

727
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:05,689
what this does is it disrupts the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

728
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:07,789
speakers control plane meanwhile traffic

729
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:09,499
the end user traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still being</font>

730
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:13,029
transited through the effect that

731
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:17,328
switches and this is quite cool because

732
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:20,239
ISP router<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an ISP router</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> b/c their</font>

733
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:22,459
sessions go down after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while and then</font>

734
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:26,869
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> start reconverting and then the</font>

735
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:29,538
XP operator sees traffic go down on the

736
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:32,089
switch and then at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I XP</font>

737
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:34,459
operator and the site wall sufficient

738
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:36,140
traffic has been rerouted to alternative

739
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:38,419
paths because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not seeing it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

740
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,689
switches anymore I can proceed with the

741
00:41:38,419 --> 00:41:42,830
actual maintenance and and this is the

742
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:46,730
layering violation we

743
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:49,880
as we have no way to signal from a lower

744
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:52,790
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> network to a higher layer that</font>

745
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,270
something is about to go down and this

746
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:59,450
actually works their numbers internet

747
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,970
exchange providers that do this when

748
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,890
they do maintenance and their customers

749
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:09,319
are happy because there is no black

750
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:12,259
holing and after you apply the calling

751
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:15,560
it is very important that you wait long

752
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,210
enough there is no fixed period of time

753
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you should wait it really depends</font>

754
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the equipment the affected parties</font>

755
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,460
use so just the guidance will be to

756
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:31,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">monitor traffic and if you if you no</font>

757
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,900
longer see it go down any further then

758
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,500
it's the good moment to start the

759
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:38,120
maintenance so the caretaker of the

760
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:43,670
fabric will will need to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

I I saw your microphone is not working

at six

microphone you want to use my microphone

00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:15,399
come here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so my question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I from my</font>

experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I found it more</font>

practical instead of a Turing session

00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:24,220
down apply filtering and stop say Indian

can exception in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> outs because in</font>

00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:31,120
this case after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the maintenance is over</font>

784
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:33,340
I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily see if the session is up</font>

785
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:38,350
and not flagging for example could you

786
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:54,220
elaborate what would be better no no no

787
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:58,720
keep the microphone hi and before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

start a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gen yes you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can indeed there are</font>

789
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,919
various ways to drain traffic the draft

790
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:09,610
hints at graceful shutdown as an example

791
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,130
to work in the voluntary context but

792
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,840
what we describe what we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to capture</font>

793
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:15,700
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document is that there's two</font>

794
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,730
sides there's the operators of the

795
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:21,220
routers and operators of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lower layer</font>

796
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and depending on who is</font>

797
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,810
initiating what type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance</font>

798
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:29,970
there are various courses of actions to

799
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:32,650
ensure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is no black holing so</font>

800
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:36,370
yeah you're right this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also a valid</font>

801
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:37,720
method so my point is probably you

802
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:41,500
should discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> draft there are</font>

803
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">other ways such a applying filters and</font>

804
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,730
you can discuss then some situation it

805
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,529
might be better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also a to the other</font>

806
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:50,140
side would expect lower level provider

807
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:53,410
to notify peers as I do in something

808
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:55,180
with as a link so i can drain

809
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,040
I traffic in advance which I know just

810
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,810
so writers so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also should</font>

811
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,700
be most current operational practice

812
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:03,540
right tell your customers that you doing

813
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:06,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">something no no no no no is part of the</font>

814
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:11,650
next version that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should notify her</font>

00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:14,110
customers if you do maintenance I Colin

Petrie ripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> ncc and minor comment from</font>

817
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:21,010
looking at draft it mostly refers to the

818
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:23,100
whole timers with regard to how long

819
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:25,720
before the session will come down and

820
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:28,240
but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I should have a</font>

821
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:32,200
mention about graceful restart as well

822
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:34,359
and the timers involved in that because

823
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,129
traffic will keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> port</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forwarding even</font>

824
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:42,010
if the session has gone down for a bit

825
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:43,360
longer yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can mention you know</font>

826
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,130
there's there's multiple factors

827
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved as well because maybe somebody</font>

828
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:51,150
has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop session or is pointing</font>

829
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:53,830
static or or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's why I think</font>

830
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:55,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">emphasize should be placed that the</font>

831
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:57,759
caretaker needs to make a judgment<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font>

832
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:01,509
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say now is the time and it's</font>

833
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,390
whatever influence it gr or slow routers

834
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:06,730
that's it's somewhat irrelevant sure I

835
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,080
mean it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of covered by the part of</font>

836
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:10,930
if you look at when the traffic has

837
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:13,060
solved and as the caretaker then then

838
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:17,230
everything should be fine but it was

839
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:21,009
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a comment thank you so one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kamari</font>

841
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:24,310
the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to tell people</font>

842
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:26,950
that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably drain bgp</font>

843
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:30,190
before unplugging stuff um it's sad but

844
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:32,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">i realize you have to you know yeah the</font>

00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,140
applying I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles on the fabric</font>

846
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:36,640
horrifies me but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than not</font>

847
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,279
doing it right these are not awesome

848
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're just better than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the alternative</font>

849

more specifically on the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

850
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:46,720
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the terminology odd like fabric</font>

852
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,470
defined in the document so we have to

853
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,090
serve guests at what it is and bgp

854
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,730
operators are sort of a weirdly done

855
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,350
term so explaining terms of it better

856
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:58,870
and who the actors are<font color="#E5E5E5"> would make it way</font>

857
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:02,200
easier to read I understand where you're

00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:04,930
coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> but since there are two</font>

887
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:49,329
oh sure you you you you block out

888
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:53,470
certain traffic where the blockage is

889
00:49:49,329 --> 00:49:58,930
not available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the BFD but the session</font>

890
00:49:53,470 --> 00:50:01,569
will go down a complex mmm the gos to

891
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:06,549
prevent the negative impacts of

892
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:08,829
maintenance and yes so to sort of

893
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:12,700
clarify the example where BFD doesn't

894
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:14,529
work who are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> jolie egli on the</font>

895
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,029
example where BFD doesn't work for you

896
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:18,309
is when you're on a multilateral

897
00:50:16,029 --> 00:50:19,750
exchange and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the maintenance is actually</font>

898
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:20,220
occurring not on the switch that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

899
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,869
on

900
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:26,490
the switch that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're here who's it</font>

901
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:31,380
attached to also to the same route

902
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:33,180
server is on and um so that doesn't

903
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:36,690
happen to rigor because he doesn't pair

904
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:39,000
in that fashion um but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that once he does</font>

905
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:40,650
happen problem problem solved yeah there

906
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,920
are perfectly good reasons to not do it

907
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:45,869
that way um and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us in fact</font>

908
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,580
prefer to not do it that way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

909
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:50,070
separate from the case where that

910
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,410
actually happens I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

911
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:57,030
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft like points to me</font>

912
00:50:52,410 --> 00:51:01,230
or points me at is the fact that um this

913
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:03,270
is actually somewhat hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do in in</font>

914
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,560
some router platforms and it's not that

915
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:08,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into the nitty-gritty</font>

916
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,560
details of interface design but in fact

917
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:12,599
this is to configuration changes on some

918
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,790
router platforms whereas in others it's

919
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:17,280
a state change which is I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

920
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:20,880
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> off this bgp session at but without</font>

921
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:23,849
changing the config right and that's

922
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually kind of a different behavior</font>

923
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:27,750
much like graceful restart which is

924
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,670
actually sort of the psychopathic

925
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:32,010
approach to this which is I'll be right

926
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:34,560
back so hold on to these routes until I

927
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:37,619
you invalidate the Nexus right<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

928
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:40,799
yes see you later like so that's that's

929
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:44,369
like the opposite approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> right um but</font>

930
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,900
you could imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could imagine and</font>

931
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:48,800
we have an automation system that does

932
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:52,410
this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to imagine it um</font>

933
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,839
that the process of reloading the router

934
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:57,240
actually drops the ebgp sessions first

935
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:59,880
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> your ibgp ones and then it</font>

936
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:03,270
hangs up and reloads which is pretty

937
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,980
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do but like we have a robot</font>

938
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:06,960
that does that for us so that the human

939
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:09,839
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to make three configuration</font>

940
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,780
changes and then unroll them in Reverse

941
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:15,000
when the router comes back up because

942
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:19,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want it to come up broken and</font>

943
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,880
start forwarding again either epsom

944
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:28,940
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the idea about TCP port</font>

945
00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:31,459
blocking but as you know distributed I

949
00:52:36,979 --> 00:52:41,390
maybe it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comment</font>

950
00:52:38,749 --> 00:52:44,868
your draft so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually cover more of the</font>

951
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:46,940
real distributed I axis and provide some

952
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:50,599
examples of how big the ACL may be

953
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:53,089
required in that case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no longer</font>

954
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,589
understand what you're saying when

955
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:57,259
you're running distributed by X and you

956
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:59,359
want to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACL on your switch it's no</font>

00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,450
what the draft does it does provide a

966
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:29,869
few configuration examples that are

967
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:33,919
applicable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few types of hardware</font>

968
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:36,739
and software on an internet exchange you

969
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,599
could apply the and if it's a course

970
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:41,059
which and your your hardware will need

971
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:43,640
to support to apply to ACL inside the

972
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:45,890
vpls instance or inside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> v excellent</font>

00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:50,118
maintenance on an edge switch which

975
00:53:47,869 --> 00:53:55,339
means you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply it directly on the</font>

00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,130
the draft should work for distributed
