00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:45,099
give a shepherd<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that he's just</font>

114
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,710
new version about draft and he will

115
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,680
prepare his Shepherds report in parallel

116
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:03,250

already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the office course anyone got</font>

148
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:55,780
drafts fours ok so i guess they're

149
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:59,469
fairly static and then we have a whole

150
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:03,069
set of kind of middle of life drafts

151
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,780
we're sort of looking to see you know

152
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:09,100
which ones are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to proceed if any</font>

153
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:12,400
of fallen by the wayside so is anyone in

154
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:17,590
here who has any knowledge of the state

155
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:19,449
of let's pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> one at random Jeff</font>

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,180
publish by august or beliefs<font color="#CCCCCC"> we code</font>

165
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:50,950
points so let's let's let's get it done

166
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay drupal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i prob this is regarding the</font>

167
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:58,030
pc p2mp we will wait for RFC 606 this

168
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,130
blue get over and apart from that we

169
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:03,130
have an implementation and we feel it's

170
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:07,770
let's table so we can progress that as

171
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:10,990
well after that thank you thanks prefer

172
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,579
request be we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are discussing with the</font>

173
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">association group object because they</font>

174
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,830
are bunch of documents dependent on that

175
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:21,970
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to prioritize that</font>

176
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:25,630
document as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is your own</font>

177
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,870
regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stephanie CJ pillars so we're</font>

178
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to revive it and then update I</font>

179
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,420
think share left wrong idea so see how

180
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:37,300
can provide but will so someone's going

181
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,400
to take the reins from shannon on we

182
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,410
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep on name but the depends on</font>

183
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,579
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want but she said she's having</font>

184
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">de penser some run</font>

185
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,410
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done with the working</font>

186
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,720
with status we move to the press

187
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,719
presentations depending please

188
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:21,350
let's wait for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so I think the</font>

189
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:24,660
first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about diversity yeah yeah</font>

190
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,280
ok so this presentation is to give you

191
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,319
an update on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

192
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:33,750
know if we are yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association diversity</font>

193
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,150
so just to remember so the overall goal

194
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:39,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this extension is to provide the</font>

195
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:42,000
ability for PCC to tell the pc is at a

196
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,719
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> LSPs belonging to a</font>

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,450
particular disjoint group we're a little

198
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:53,220
LS particular group could be so this is

199
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:57,000
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> global ID so we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reusing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

200
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,220
base<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association who draft and the ID is</font>

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,120
to use a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association type</font>

202
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,920
Tara this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a diversity that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

203
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,850
worship so compared to the previous

204
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,680
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in the first version we used</font>

205
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:14,550
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association types so one for</font>

206
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:18,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">each disjoin s-type what about sodium</font>

207
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:20,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">disjoint i saw SLG join s based on the</font>

208
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments that we received on the list so</font>

209
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">we moved to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a different type of encoding</font>

210
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,960
so now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Association type</font>

211
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:31,970
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> past diversity and we are</font>

212
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:37,200
including via diversity flavor in some

213
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:40,020
additional GM so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tlv that we</font>

214
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,540
are using so it was already detailed in

215
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:46,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the previous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> version but we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed</font>

216
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:50,099
slightly the flags so it's called vida

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jonas information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlv</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we are using</font>

218
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,630
an encoding which is a line to what has

219
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:59,970
been done<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ya as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wecker object so we</font>

220
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:04,290
have our flags so for SLG not an<font color="#CCCCCC"> integer</font>

221
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:07,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">ness and we are keep using the shortest</font>

222
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,540
path bitterness<font color="#CCCCCC"> trick nesbitt that were</font>

223
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">already detailed in the faster in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

224
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:18,120
first version based also on the

225
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:22,109
discussion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a comment</font>

226
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">from from Adrian about our weekend</font>

227
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,980
couple this with the object

228
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:30,880
function so we give now the ability to

229
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,880
add an objective function tlv within the

230
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">association group so what we are</font>

231
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,570
proposing that we can discuss this

232
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:43,600
option we propose to use via<font color="#CCCCCC"> of' least</font>

233
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:46,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">yearly which is already existing but we</font>

234
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,990
are we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to limited to just a single</font>

235
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:53,349
entry maybe we can find a more suitable

236
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:58,000
option but reusing via of' object was

237
00:13:53,350 --> 00:14:00,160
not really good so this was the options

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,339
that we are taking for now and we are

239
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">adding the earth functions we are</font>

240
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:09,010
reusing the one that have been proposed

241
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:13,060
in via draft from who about our

242
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:17,170
functions for for diversity there was

243
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:19,689
also some data requested also by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adrian</font>

244
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,149
I think about what is exact meaning of

245
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,640
his shortest<font color="#E5E5E5"> path bit so we added the</font>

246
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:27,640
dedicated paragraph hobbies so the

247
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,670
global ideas to tell for one or more

248
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,890
particular LSP<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the group I want</font>

249
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,959
absolutely to use what we call the

250
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,720
shortest paths with the shortest path is

251
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,170
in fact the path that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is taking into</font>

252
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,980
account all the constraints of LSP

253
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:46,870
except<font color="#E5E5E5"> we join us so this means that</font>

254
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,660
this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP with the pivot set</font>

255
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,329
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> will take into account all the</font>

256
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,360
constraint except the disjoint ness and

257
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:57,910
all the other LSPs will be disjoint on

258
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,190
this one so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the global meaning</font>

259
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,430
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a clearly you need to</font>

260
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:06,640
provide some one path which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

261
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">optimal of some customer otherwise if</font>

262
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:14,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control the disjoint edge you</font>

263
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,099
may have to complete a non optimal path

264
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,040
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> also some requests to deal</font>

265
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,610
with the case where the pc is not able

266
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find a path or also you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provide a</font>

267
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:30,430
path but it can relax the design s

268
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:33,069
constraint who are it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it's</font>

269
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:36,969
possible for example when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are setting</font>

270
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:37,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">the SB 20 so the designers constraint is</font>

271
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,270
not straight

272
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:46,220
so the pc is able to relax it so what we

273
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:48,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">are proposing is a 15 the next slide so</font>

274
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,560
in case the pc is not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find the</font>

275
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:54,860
disjoint paths so we are reusing no path

276
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,569
vector tlv and we are defining two new

277
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:01,130
bits will be clv so one to indicate that

278
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,640
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to find a disjoint</font>

279
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:07,070
paths and one which is it cannot compute

280
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,170
the path because it doesn't it does not

281
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,710
have the requested algorithm so for

282
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:15,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">example we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requesting an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SL g join s</font>

283
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:20,390
and it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely not able to do it</font>

284
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:25,760
from an advert legal point of view and

285
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:28,870
regarding via constraint relaxing so

286
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:32,600
when the disjoin s cannot be found and

287
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:35,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pc is providing a path which is not</font>

288
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,270
the joint so we need to inform the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCC</font>

289
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,850
that this path is not complete fulfill

290
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,900
fully fulfilling sorry the constraints

291
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:48,200
so we are proposing a new relaxed

292
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:50,780
constraint theory which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more generic</font>

293
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,450
so it's not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> tied with julius kahn</font>

294
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,209
strange may be used in overall use case

295
00:16:53,450 --> 00:17:00,500
where the particular constraint is

296
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:02,180
authorized to beer to be relaxed<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

297
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,640
we need some discussion on the

298
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,639
encouraging obvious so what we are

299
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposing today but clearly require some</font>

300
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:14,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion is a just to put the object</font>

301
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:16,339
that has been a so via objector

302
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,980
responding to the constraint that has

303
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,109
been relaxed so this is a proposal

304
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:28,099
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we need some discussion</font>

305
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:31,399
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> visa on cuddling proposal so about</font>

306
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:33,379
the next step so we think that we

307
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,520
addressed as a comments that we receive

308
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,440
with the Scalia need for some

309
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,170
description and<font color="#E5E5E5"> enhancement about so as</font>

310
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,890
a new proposal so feel free to to give a

311
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:48,610
your feedback and will be a welcome from

312
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document</font>

313
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:57,140
thank you Stefan any feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> command</font>

314
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:58,850
question no everything was clear so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

315
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,510
that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I proposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to move to your</font>

316
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:07,090
other presentation yeah so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one</font>

317
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:10,520
about state synchronization between<font color="#CCCCCC"> RPC</font>

318
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:13,669
so the god of document is first to

319
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:17,090
define the procedures for stateful PCE

320
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:19,790
communication between two pc nodes so

321
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,699
because a state full communication has

322
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:25,700
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined from a pc to pc point of</font>

323
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:29,000
view but we don't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exact process</font>

324
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:33,770
your follow a pc to pc communication so

325
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,970
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the ball and why doing this one</font>

326
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:40,250
of the driver is to bring more

327
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:45,140
resiliency in the design so in case i

328
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:47,750
have some pc to pc<font color="#CCCCCC"> session failure i may</font>

329
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,880
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send some state using this</font>

330
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:53,110
interview see communication so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

331
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,910
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> primary goal and we over</font>

332
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:59,449
topic in this document is to deal with a

333
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:02,210
path computation optimality and also

334
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,370
some computation loop scenario where you

335
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:08,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">are falling into some split brain and</font>

336
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:10,729
you have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc computing one LSP 1pc</font>

337
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,950
computing and over LSP and the two pc

338
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,800
and the to LSPs are linked to each other

339
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,660
so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a path of one LSPs</font>

340
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">depending of yoga you may fall into</font>

341
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:25,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">computation loop and we are proposing</font>

342
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:28,780
some math of slave behavior between the

343
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:33,830
pc and inkay in this kind of situation

344
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:36,200
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big work that has been done from</font>

hundra about Olivia real time

348
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,720
synchronization so we have something now

349
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:50,060
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a liner we have a single</font>

350
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,880
proposal for all the interp see a

351
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:56,480
stateful communication it's also include

352
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,790
part of year Aly article on<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC which</font>

353
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,260
will be based also on this on this

354
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,680
extension

355
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:07,160
we do we done some slight changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in VR</font>

356
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,890
deposit also globally in terms of

357
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,350
capability we still have a bit to signal

358
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:17,240
that this is a particular interface

359
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:21,590
instead for communication when the

360
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:24,530
session is set up both<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcs will behave</font>

361
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a PC on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PC at the same time so we</font>

362
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,540
will have bi-directional synchronization

363
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,150
so each PC will synchronize the

364
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,580
realistic it's a nest a synchronous

365
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:37,550
process oh yeah there is no particular

366
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:41,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">order here and the idea is that to</font>

367
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:44,510
identify the original PCC address we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

368
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,570
relying now on via speaker identity tlv

369
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:51,470
which has been already defined so we

370
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:54,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">already used tlv tua to carry the</font>

371
00:20:51,470 --> 00:21:03,770
original position well sooner or pasetta

372
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:06,830
messages so now how does it work so

373
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:09,920
globally<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a LSD state</font>

374
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:12,590
synchronization so when a PCC receives a

375
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:15,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> states with a piece of report</font>

376
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,899
message whatever the state of the

377
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:21,200
delegation it will forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to all the</font>

378
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,210
pc using the states in session<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

379
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,650
important hole is that we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

380
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:30,770
authorize a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc to follow up this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piece</font>

00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:34,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">apricot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to another pc so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

382
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:38,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">primarily to prevent message groups and</font>

383
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:42,230
it's clearly simplify the design so when

384
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:45,199
the pc receives on a pc see it can send

385
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:49,900
to a pc but when a pc is receiving from

386
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,900
a pc it will not send<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to another pc</font>

387
00:21:53,149 --> 00:22:01,830
based on this a particular LSP state may

388
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,289
be received by multiple sources it may

389
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:07,289
be received directly from the PCC and it

390
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:12,059
may be received also from another pc or

391
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:14,999
even multiple pc we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least we</font>

392
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:17,820
propose to only keep track of a single

393
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:20,370
state so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just keep in memory the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

394
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,230
state that we are because from a network

395
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,959
point of view there is a single state

396
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,519
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been</font>

397
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,220
advertised by the pc so it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

398
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,499
really make sense at least on our point

399
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,320
of view to keep track<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the states</font>

400
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:38,009
what is important to track is the

401
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,769
sources of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state so we keep one</font>

402
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:46,049
state but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep track of all the</font>

403
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:49,289
sources where we learn the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> farm so</font>

404
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:52,168
this means that in k if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to remove</font>

405
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:54,658
a particular LSP state<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need to have</font>

406
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:57,509
this source list to be empty so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need</font>

407
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:03,409
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive a removal from all the</font>

408
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:03,409
sources that<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide media or this state</font>

409
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:11,970
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last point on this draft is what</font>

410
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:16,740
we call a delegation so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a master</font>

411
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:20,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">slave behavior that i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced in the</font>

412
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning of a presentation so globally</font>

413
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,279
to solve this path computation

414
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:30,990
optimality sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really need to</font>

415
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:32,940
have a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc computing a set of</font>

416
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:38,899
particular of LSPs that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

417
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:41,879
together if multiple pcs are trying to

418
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:44,998
compute path for the set of LSP let's

419
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:47,129
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see one computes path for LSP one</font>

420
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:50,490
pc to compute<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path for LSP tools</font>

421
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:52,649
that are really working together we may

422
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">fall into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computation loop or some</font>

423
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:57,899
perfect mates so in order to service we

424
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,919
want to ensure that for this particular

425
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:05,219
group of LSP we want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one pc will</font>

426
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,010
perform<font color="#CCCCCC"> the computation so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

427
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:11,610
proposed that

428
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:15,540
when a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCC is delegating an LSP to a PC</font>

429
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:19,350
OPC can decide to sub delegate the

430
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,389
computation to another pc so we are just

431
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:25,620
defining in this document with sub

432
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:27,690
delegation procedure but this election

433
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,780
of master slave is completely out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

434
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,900
scope it could be a manual configuration

435
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:36,990
telling that this particular LSP must be

436
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,120
primarily computed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> these species that</font>

437
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,370
has this IP address it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by</font>

438
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,620
maybe a protocol extension but this is

439
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:46,860
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are defining</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

440
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:50,729
ears with just master slave behavior

441
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:53,340
well when a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC receives the delegation</font>

442
00:24:50,730 --> 00:25:02,790
it can decide to serve delegate it to

443
00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:05,520
another pc and when this<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc sub delegate</font>

444
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">v LSP to another one it lose the control</font>

445
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,010
on reality so by itself it cannot

446
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:14,219
compute the path anymore it cannot

447
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:21,660
update the LSP anymore it will be the

448
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:24,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole of the mass Topsy so how does we</font>

449
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:27,180
have date work so globally we master pc

450
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:31,530
will be responsible of the computation

451
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:35,460
for ver LSP of the set of LSP it is

452
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:40,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsible for it will update all the</font>

453
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:43,920
pcs with the difference that forms the

454
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:46,350
pc that perform the sub delegation it

455
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,080
will set the delegation flag one and

456
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:52,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">four viewers it will side with the</font>

457
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,679
aviation flag to job why are we sending

458
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:57,959
an update towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC is just to</font>

459
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,360
speed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sink the state</font>

460
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,590
synchronization because if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do</font>

461
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:07,320
this we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to wait for the PCC to</font>

462
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:11,790
receive your date and then propagate it

463
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:15,960
back to VDC it can work but if we are

464
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:18,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">updating all the pcs from the start it</font>

465
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,919
will be faster that's just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> god</font>

466
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:24,890
and after it's a question of cascading a

467
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,470
PCO date so when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slave pc is</font>

468
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:31,370
receiving the pc update it will see in

469
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:34,190
the speaker identity tlv that this is an

470
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:37,668
update<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a particular of PCC and it</font>

471
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:46,910
will relay the pc update to the original

472
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:52,940
pieces so this extension is also based

473
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:55,490
for a miracle picea stateful work so if

474
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,950
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the article stateful PCE</font>

475
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,320
we'll have to advertise<font color="#CCCCCC"> interpreting</font>

476
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:03,200
capability and in addition you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will add</font>

477
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,649
the article pc kappa<font color="#CCCCCC"> dt and this is</font>

478
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:15,860
detailed in the artists estate fula hpc

479
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:19,130
right when we built this architecture we

480
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:22,129
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about first message groups that</font>

481
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:25,850
we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid best buy this kind of</font>

482
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:28,900
spittle reason mechanism between a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc</font>

483
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:33,139
but we also thought that it may be

484
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:36,010
optionally interesting to record some

485
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:42,020
information when the messages are

486
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:45,020
propagated through multiple apps so we

487
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:48,830
are proposing budgets pure an optional

488
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:54,549
behavior that each<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece is each piece</font>

489
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:57,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">of speaker may add in a new tlv some</font>

490
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:59,629
precepts picture information so for

491
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its IP address or if we want to</font>

492
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:06,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know we got some particular</font>

493
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:08,590
information on yes this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

494
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can</font>

495
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:20,470
so just a summary so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

496
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:23,480
need for us to have this<font color="#CCCCCC"> interpersonal</font>

497
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:26,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">communication to an ends via resiliency</font>

498
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:30,590
or the a path computation<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimality ax</font>

499
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:33,789
and so on I think we are now<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the good</font>

500
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:37,059
track with this stone that interview see

501
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:41,150
procedure whatever I saw the article

502
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:45,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">flat or whatever so yes it's clearly</font>

503
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:49,039
more generic now and we would like to

504
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">request the working group adoption for</font>

505
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:55,158
this document and if you have any

506
00:28:50,750 --> 00:29:00,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback good or bad feel free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

507
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:09,950
us any comments in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room I see</font>

508
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:12,320
someone in stunning taking about you

509
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:14,960
slides up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the time when you're</font>

510
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,889
talking about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we select</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the single</font>

511
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,929
stake but yet maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use this way</font>

512
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,320
yeah we say we keep a single state the

513
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:27,169
last one level the last one level is

514
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:33,260
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> there curing state so why</font>

515
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:36,350
why you are stabilized<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it could</font>

516
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:41,450
not be the different propagation we are

517
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:45,020
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts cooking yes mmm so PC</font>

518
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:48,380
she sends word masterpiece assistance

519
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:51,408
was like a message to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> slave somehow</font>

520
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,870
goes fast yes but the state or whatever

521
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:55,460
the order of a message the final stage

522
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,939
that you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have will be the state of</font>

523
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:04,070
the PCC because the pc are not changing

524
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:06,440
me ok I'll do you mean inkay up I<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

525
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a happy yes yeah yes one case of</font>

526
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:16,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">clapping yes in case of flapping but if</font>

527
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:19,309
you start fluffy this make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out yes we</font>

528
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:23,780
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this and one of the ideas</font>

529
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:24,889
that we add<font color="#CCCCCC"> east for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PCC to add a</font>

530
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:28,070
kind of time

531
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:31,190
yeah this was an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have in</font>

532
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:33,290
mind too high to solve this it's got in

533
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,210
the document yet but if you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

534
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:44,000
that it's an interest and like yeah

535
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:50,420
point we can edit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks thank you</font>

536
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">any other comments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I love improv</font>

537
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:56,510
avi since I think that is actually

538
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:59,300
interesting the solutions but here from

539
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:02,540
the my point of view I have some days

540
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:04,460
about about this one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

541
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:08,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in either of the occasion scenario</font>

542
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:14,810
once this the connection between the pc

543
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:16,990
and the GCC is broken for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcc in</font>

544
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:21,560
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> little harder is harder to</font>

545
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:25,790
determine you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pce one is the active</font>

546
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:28,129
or usually start you can kind of check

547
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,889
more funny because maybe if the study

548
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:35,300
that is not you the broken of the link

549
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:38,420
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure because only the pce</font>

550
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:41,659
maybe walk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact our the pc</font>

551
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:44,180
and pcc a lot of other links in order

552
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:47,240
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> the PDP on net half and some the</font>

553
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:51,020
data needed to synchronization but only

554
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:54,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PCE</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> walker I'm not for the effect</font>

555
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:58,010
the effect that is ok for the you know

556
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,810
you know all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future so that's why</font>

557
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:02,270
I'm not sure to understand your point

558
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:05,330
but if for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> here the pcs</font>

559
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,850
completely failing it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue if</font>

560
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,949
it was a messed up you see this one will

561
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:16,459
take over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will compute the path</font>

562
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:19,220
oh yeah that's that yes but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> my in</font>

563
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,970
fact my comments to you that the in fact

564
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:27,680
that the scenario maybe the maybe more

565
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:30,680
complex than we assumed sensory in the

566
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:34,010
different application scenario and also

567
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:37,490
the pc and a cutie see what is sure is

568
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:38,750
that you will never be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to solve all</font>

569
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,320
the kind of failure

570
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:44,480
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find some multiple of</font>

571
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,790
failure of scenario where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are losing</font>

572
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,620
this session this session and maybe this

573
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:51,889
one and in this case yes your

574
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:55,550
computation will not be fine but yeah

575
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:58,460
you can try to enhance by bringing more

576
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:01,190
PC more<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece obsession but at a certain</font>

577
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:04,280
point you will never be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to cuddle</font>

578
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:07,190
also fail your<font color="#E5E5E5"> case ok I will check</font>

579
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:16,639
acabe car we want middle east of his car

580
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:23,960
shop could we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a show friends to be</font>

581
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:27,460
from people read the document please not

582
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:31,100
so many please read the document here

583
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:34,550
because when we exclude the<font color="#CCCCCC"> authors this</font>

584
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,780
I want some<font color="#E5E5E5"> money so I think doesn't</font>

585
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much sense to build the room</font>

586
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:41,930
further today but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

587
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,290
interesting work in there it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

588
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:48,530
address missing feature from the pset

589
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:50,420
toolset so please read the document

590
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,690
share your feedback using the mailing

591
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:56,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">list and think use the van problem</font>

592
00:33:52,690 --> 00:34:01,760
representation next presenter is a

593
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:04,190
sentire guess what will<font color="#E5E5E5"> win the next</font>

594
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,650
presenter could<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remind anyone asking</font>

595
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,910
questions it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to go to the</font>

596
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,560
eighth apart and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we</font>

597
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:13,190
capture your questionable responds

598
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:16,060
correctly otherwise we may miss some

599
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,060
subtle tea thanks

600
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:30,310
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tinea yeah this one talks about</font>

601
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:33,310
the pic ability for a pc to request the

602
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,710
control of an LSP from the TCC<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go a</font>

603
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:39,460
few use cases and then the proposal on

604
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,840
the table so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kept the slide we</font>

605
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,420
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use case in the next</font>

606
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,580
slide so most more operators are moving

607
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:48,820
towards the centralized 30stm control

608
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:54,580
and also looking for new enhancement and

609
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:57,550
one such enhancement or was awesome and

610
00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">one such enhancement is for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC to</font>

611
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,500
take control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an LSP for global</font>

612
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,050
optimization we've got there's some

613
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,520
scenarios where the pc has a better view

614
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:11,470
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network in terms of futuristic</font>

615
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:13,540
demands surface demands and this draft

616
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:17,140
talks about the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a PCE to</font>

617
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:19,690
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> control of a specific LSP optimizer</font>

618
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:22,960
and then maybe written it back to the

619
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:27,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">PCC if needed so it's it's a very</font>

620
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:30,370
straightforward<font color="#E5E5E5"> rap so mostly looking at</font>

621
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,470
global optimization of LSP the pc able

622
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:35,109
to control some specific LSPs in the

623
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:38,620
network we've got a few other use cases

624
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:41,950
also defined in the trash one such one

625
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:44,259
is the pc load balancing cases where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

626
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,689
could have a specific pc<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests the</font>

627
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:50,080
subset of LSPs and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can they</font>

628
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:52,330
can load balance across multiple pcs to

629
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,480
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to optimize some LSPs in the</font>

630
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:59,680
network and also the failure cases well

631
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:01,540
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I lose of tce the neighboring pc or</font>

632
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">the standby pc could always request</font>

633
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:08,440
access to optimize the specific error

634
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:10,270
stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so going back to the</font>

635
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposal the straightforward proposal</font>

636
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:16,840
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposing is a control LSP</font>

637
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:19,540
control flag set as part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> srp</font>

638
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,720
object so it's gonna be part of the the

639
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:28,630
update message and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc sets the flat 12</font>

640
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:30,850
indicator in control of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SP and this</font>

641
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:33,270
is identified by the LSP object so it's

642
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,270
a very straightforward

643
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:41,339
laughs so asking for a new control

644
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,470
request flag and it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the PC to</font>

645
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:46,980
delegate and not delegate so you're not

646
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:49,109
change any other mechanisms in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC</font>

647
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,809
stateful<font color="#E5E5E5"> track so this is just an add on</font>

648
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:56,670
to it to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to control but then you</font>

649
00:36:51,809 --> 00:37:03,510
get specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> elephants so any questions</font>

650
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:05,640
comes I see someone coming I taking

651
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:08,609
portunity to just do this that it would

652
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,009
be good to avoid choosing the bit number

653
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:14,009
you allocate you should leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

654
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jana you request for a bit we had this</font>

655
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,089
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the list but it is still</font>

656
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:21,359
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation don't</font>

657
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:25,920
choose the bit number<font color="#E5E5E5"> now all right</font>

658
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:28,680
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for later thank you related to</font>

659
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,539
that so before we allocate the bits so

660
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,328
you started your presentation saying

661
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:36,089
more of operators are deploying this

662
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:38,609
which can you be a little bit more

663
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:41,190
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube we only have as many</font>

664
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:43,740
flags as we had and I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

665
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before we start allocating flights</font>

666
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:50,788
we actually solving real problems that

667
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:54,299
operators are seeing versus technology

668
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:57,480
heretical problems if you can if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

669
00:37:54,299 --> 00:38:00,509
maybe add some comments on you jab from

670
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,210
statement more operators to Bill to Bill

671
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,859
in the case for<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra bit yeah all right</font>

672
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:07,079
so at least from where I stand<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

673
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:08,520
seen this time and again where we try to

674
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,829
optimize something less pieces a network

675
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,529
but yeah we could always we can probably

676
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:17,180
flag by some of this on the trap and and

677
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:17,180
maybe we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your comments</font>

678
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:27,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I believe you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a couple of</font>

679
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">minor items to address to justify a new</font>

680
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:33,039
version use that invasion to try to

681
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:36,640
gather some support on the mailing list

682
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:40,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then we can see how we can progress</font>

683
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:49,420
may I just have<font color="#E5E5E5"> show friends on people</font>

684
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:52,450
read that document<font color="#E5E5E5"> drew a dozen okay</font>

685
00:38:49,420 --> 00:39:00,549
among those who read do you believe this

686
00:38:52,450 --> 00:39:03,788
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a useful feature almost the same yeah</font>

687
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:08,910
maybe couple less but almost the same

688
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:08,910
okay that's a useful feedback thank you

689
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:16,859
next presenter is drove i guess i'm

690
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,859
doing the head but yeah

691
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:44,990
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is truth this is a code point a</font>

692
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,820
location I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ITF ago we presented</font>

693
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,500
that and we got the feedback from the

694
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,710
mailing list as well as during the

695
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:54,400
meeting so we have incorporated that in

696
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:57,200
this version so let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

697
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,390
the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is that we have our</font>

698
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,399
piece of registry as we all know the

699
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:04,609
usual allocation policy that we have

700
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,220
followed is ITF consensus that all

701
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:11,140
assignments are<font color="#CCCCCC"> via RFC's which are</font>

702
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:13,399
approved by is<font color="#E5E5E5"> G of course we have</font>

703
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier locations which is very useful</font>

704
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,800
when we are implementing and we want to

705
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the bits set but as you are seeing</font>

706
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,030
recently in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc working group and</font>

707
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,730
otherwise the experimentations that are

708
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:28,390
going on with the use of pc in various

709
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:31,940
cases we also do realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that not having</font>

710
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:34,670
some bits set aside for experimentation

711
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,850
can cause problem so we are hoping with

712
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:40,160
this update if we can have some bits for

713
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:42,529
experimentation use for pset messages

714
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,250
and objects and theories so that we can

715
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">start using them the main</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aim is as as</font>

716
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:55,220
the experimental usage describes is to

717
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:57,020
facilitate environments and main aim is

718
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that these values will not collide with</font>

719
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,790
any of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> i na locations that may</font>

720
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,150
happen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> future as well as the current</font>

721
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:06,890
once and especially now if Ben we are

722
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,720
seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app also in the open source</font>

723
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,730
we want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that when we have</font>

724
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,299
features which are not standardized or

725
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:16,640
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not at the level of I na</font>

726
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,830
location the kind of bits that we use

727
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,200
belongs to the experimental so that it

728
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:24,020
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not create any confusion so that's</font>

729
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,379
a main aim with this document and when

730
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:30,710
we we saw the problem in the open source

731
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,300
that this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening so we that's why</font>

732
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:35,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are writing this job to solve this as</font>

733
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,359
quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible so</font>

734
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,940
what were the feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what's the</font>

735
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,130
update we were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get more</font>

736
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback and trying to use that what</font>

737
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:47,260
other what are the registries that we

738
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:49,390
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have for experimental the kind</font>

739
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,460
of feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we got was focused only</font>

740
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:53,170
on the essential don't try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it for</font>

741
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,770
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's what we are doing</font>

742
00:41:53,170 --> 00:42:00,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">only three things p</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sep messages he said</font>

743
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:01,630
objects and a generate p sub tlv those

744
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:04,270
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three things in which we would</font>

745
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:07,720
like a small experimental range set

746
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:09,730
aside we had an appendix which was

747
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,368
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what other issues can</font>

748
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,380
happen and what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with object</font>

749
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:18,490
type notification so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> removed all</font>

750
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:20,680
that detail from the drafts now we were

751
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:23,049
also thinking of whether there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a role</font>

752
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,299
of pc working group wiki there so again

753
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:28,089
the feedback was not to do anything like

754
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:31,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so we have removed that completely</font>

755
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:35,859
and we have aligned<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 36 RFC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 36 92</font>

756
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:38,230
which states that that this range is

757
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:40,119
only for experimentation and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

758
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:42,190
needs to consent between each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other that</font>

759
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:44,890
what is the meaning of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits and</font>

760
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:47,559
other implementations may use the same

761
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:49,180
numbers for different uses so that's why

762
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:51,339
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to maintain a</font>

763
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:55,390
wiki and that's the policy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

764
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:58,328
following with this update what's the

765
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:01,359
update looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> expected for</font>

766
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:03,880
experimental allocation for messages are

767
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:06,990
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> four objects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around 31 bits for</font>

768
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,920
messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight and forty Elway's</font>

769
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:14,709
allocation policy that we would like to

770
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:18,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">set is experimental as per</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5226 so</font>

771
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:20,260
basically we<font color="#E5E5E5"> behave what the feedback</font>

772
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:22,210
that we got from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time we have</font>

773
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,920
incorporated and i hope the working

774
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:27,039
group is happy with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and with that</font>

775
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can hopefully adopt it and move it so</font>

776
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:33,700
that we can avoid any<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential issues</font>

777
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:35,650
in this area in future as a part of

778
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,618
ongoing effort in owners we have already

779
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:41,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">started using these values for the</font>

780
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:46,529
experimental extensions so that we can

781
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:46,529
avoid issues I think that's it thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

782
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:58,240
ready any comments or truth this was one

783
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:00,680
in nine place and rude<font color="#CCCCCC"> Organon okay and</font>

784
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,490
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great work very important very</font>

785
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:08,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">needed a we'd probably as in any</font>

786
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:09,890
protocol we want to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect that</font>

787
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:13,788
behavior because you may have an

788
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:17,390
experimental things added a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cup of the</font>

789
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:20,359
light network so you want to describe

790
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:24,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">the behavior what happens if the</font>

791
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:27,740
receiving<font color="#E5E5E5"> end do not know how to</font>

792
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:32,539
interpret<font color="#CCCCCC"> X an experiment our bits no</font>

793
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:35,029
set to some yeah luckily<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the RFC</font>

794
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:37,760
5440 handles all those cases quite well

795
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:40,190
like unknown messages in case it's from

796
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,559
the experimental range or unknown<font color="#CCCCCC"> TL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vs</font>

797
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:46,880
unknown objects so since the range is

798
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,950
already from the not allocated not use

799
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,829
so if somebody who is not following this

800
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:57,319
experiment even follow RFC pie<font color="#CCCCCC"> 440</font>

801
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:58,880
behavior quickly scan for this I never

802
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,650
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive not mentioned that in the</font>

803
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,869
Dahlia I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he's big mention</font>

804
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:05,119
he's probably just for<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it like this</font>

805
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:07,940
no yeah understood<font color="#E5E5E5"> no you know just</font>

806
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,680
clarification even if she's already

807
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:12,619
covered you make just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide and sometimes</font>

808
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:16,669
2.22 that to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone knows we</font>

809
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:23,270
are reusing existing mechanisms just for

810
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:29,750
gratification so she's reasonable solid

811
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:31,520
let's know who's read the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

812
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:36,380
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> about eight people have owned up</font>

813
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:38,538
to it and and those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who would</font>

814
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to see this draft adopted in peace</font>

815
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:46,250
EE that's the same people<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um yeah I</font>

816
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:47,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that we badly need this it's</font>

817
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important so we're going to take</font>

818
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:53,859
this to the mainland list after the

819
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,859
meeting thanks truth

820
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:04,650
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> europe again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

821
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:09,190
update<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a bunch of documents mainly</font>

822
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:12,040
stateful<font color="#E5E5E5"> HPC and the related stuff do</font>

823
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:14,140
actn that how we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the PC</font>

824
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:18,090
architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the PCF extension so</font>

825
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:20,830
far with the stateful HPC and

826
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:22,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Association objects etc on behalf of all</font>

827
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:24,759
the co-authors<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am presenting this</font>

828
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:27,370
update since there are a couple of

829
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,200
documents involved here I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

830
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:32,319
show what is the relationship between

831
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,000
these documents we have an applicability

832
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,280
document which is an informational

833
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,530
document which talks about how do we

834
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:42,340
apply the various piece of extensions in

835
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:44,680
architecture inside a CDM and I will

836
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,780
talk about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> update to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but apart</font>

837
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,529
from that we have the various extensions

838
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:53,590
that come into picture we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the PCF</font>

839
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:57,040
LS part the stateful HTC part and the VN

840
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:59,560
association part in this presentation I

841
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:04,450
am focusing on the yellow dotted lines

842
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:06,250
but peace fls and even the drop which

843
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:08,770
must be which differ and just presented

844
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:11,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">thus the state sink is also related to</font>

845
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:14,560
stateful HPC so all these drafts how

846
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:17,950
they play a role in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actn that's the</font>

00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,440
stuff as well similarly<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fls is</font>

855
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,990
just a mechanism to carry link state

856
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,180
within the pisa pisa pls is one of the

857
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:46,390
ACCDN is one of the use case for it but

858
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:48,669
it's an independent work as well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VN</font>

859
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:51,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">association is something that is kind of</font>

860
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:55,360
specific to a CDN that we have so

861
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,950
starting with a stateful HPC the

862
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,600
document is pretty straightforward it's

863
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:02,230
an informational document which talks

864
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:05,410
about how the HPC and the state for pc

865
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:08,290
can be merged together to form stateful

866
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,920
HPC basically it's an we already have a

867
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,560
hierarchy

868
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">PC what if those pcs are stateful pc</font>

869
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,960
then it is a hierarchy of stateful pc

870
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:20,890
this was discussed I think in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ghana</font>

871
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cyrus and we had good feedback the kind</font>

872
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:26,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">of changes that are needed in protocol</font>

873
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">stefan is doing it in a generic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way so</font>

874
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:29,920
that can anyway we used in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document</font>

875
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,200
this document that's why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

876
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:38,080
informational it doesn't ask for any

877
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol changes in the document so what</font>

878
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm running through yes this</font>

879
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,770
is a so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the changes that we</font>

880
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:47,620
made there were comments related to

881
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:50,500
adding clarification on how the

882
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:52,480
recursive nature works and it can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

883
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:55,270
multiple levels as for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hpc</font>

884
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,780
architecture so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is all piece of</font>

885
00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:00,910
messages delegations of reports updates

886
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:04,480
can be done in a recursive way similar

887
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:06,399
to how fun presented in the state draft

888
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,710
the only differences that this is a

889
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,970
parent pc and a child<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc relationship</font>

890
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:15,730
rather than a master and a slave how do

891
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:17,770
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we clarified how the capability</font>

892
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:20,380

893
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:23,530
have a HPC capability tlv as a part of

00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:26,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">pc her</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i key extensions and we have the</font>

stateful PCE capability tlv as well as

896
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:32,650
the the bit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is added for inter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pc</font>

897
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:36,150
communication together we can use that

898
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">for advertising the stateful HPC</font>

899
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:41,890
capability how would we manage the state

900
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:45,190
synchronization as per the previous

901
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,839
presentation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw and are there</font>

902
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:49,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">any considerations with respect to</font>

903
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:52,720
scalability etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

904
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:54,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle that how that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can be taken care</font>

905
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,859
what kind of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs to</font>

906
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:59,560
be pushed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the parent pc so our</font>

907
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:03,070
recommendation is that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to report</font>

908
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:05,799
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> the LSPs that the parent pc could</font>

909
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:08,650
use for its optimizations which is

910
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:11,080
usually inter domain or the LSPs that he

911
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:13,390
is personally involved in you don't have

912
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,940
to push all the LSPs from all the child

913
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:18,460
pcs to the parent pc and apart from that

914
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pisa protocol allows you to have</font>

915
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,930
notifications and

916
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:25,779
the other way to handle scalability as a

917
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:29,169
part of stateful pc draft itself those

918
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:32,140
are applicable even in stateful HPC case

919
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:34,300
and we also took care of the security

920
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:37,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the manageability considerations as</font>

921
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,170
well so we have tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

922
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,150
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comments that we have received</font>

923
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:42,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the documents get a little bit</font>

924
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:47,080
better so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the update for stateful</font>

925
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:49,840
HPC moving on to the VN<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association I</font>

926
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:52,060
think the main concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> here was that</font>

927
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:55,240
what would be the use of having this

928
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:57,580
kind of association with in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> P sub so</font>

929
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,750
within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actn working group we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

930
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:04,390
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is a Wien and how</font>

931
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:06,970
knowing which set of LSPs together form

932
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:09,160
a virtual network is quite useful when

933
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:11,020
we are thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reorganization sore</font>

934
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,230
when we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of how to represent</font>

935
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:18,460
a virtual network for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user as a</font>

936
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:20,680
selection as a as a list of BN members

937
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:25,000
so having<font color="#CCCCCC"> this association as a part of</font>

938
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">DC protocol could be very useful what</font>

939
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,060
are the cases we would like to optimize

940
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:34,450
all LSPs belonging to a particular VN

941
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:36,400
rather than doing this /<font color="#E5E5E5"> LSP so having</font>

942
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:39,279
this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> association I can have a</font>

943
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,490
better optimization functions and better

944
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,410
policy to handle that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and any VN</font>

945
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:47,799
specific action that I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

946
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:51,330
perform having this relationship between

947
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:54,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the LSP is known in my her</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I key of</font>

948
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:58,480
controllers is useful so passing this

949
00:51:54,370 --> 00:52:02,140
information from parent to child is is

950
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:06,480
needed so we uses we use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association</font>

951
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:09,700
object itself add a new Association type

952
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:14,410
for VN and rest of the procedure remains

953
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:15,939
the same we<font color="#CCCCCC"> added a charity to why we</font>

954
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:17,890
are doing this what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

955
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:21,910
we would need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this kind</font>

956
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:24,029
Association whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for fresh path</font>

957
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:26,980
computation or during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimization</font>

958
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:29,180
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to not just optimize</font>

959
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:32,009
a single LSD but

960
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:35,339
optimize the whole VN that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection</font>

961
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:37,589
of all LSPs needs to work together to

962
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:40,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the best results</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the easy TN</font>

963
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:41,880
scenarios so that's our main use case

964
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,969
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why we feel passing this</font>

965
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:47,279
information could be is needed we also

966
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:48,989
added<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vendor information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlv support</font>

967
00:52:47,279 --> 00:52:52,709
within this association object so that

968
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:58,019
any vendor specific things we can pass

969
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:59,578
from parent to child as well so now this

970
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:03,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the document that brings everything</font>

971
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:06,079
else together it tries to say that how

972
00:53:03,299 --> 00:53:08,999
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we apply the various PC extensions of</font>

973
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,819
which are in place within the a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CDN</font>

974
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:15,479

975
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:19,109

functions which the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MDS see and or the</font>

00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:27,719
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

979
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:29,999
document we list<font color="#E5E5E5"> with in various ways in</font>

980
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:32,459
which ECF can be used but we also know

981
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:35,488
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use P sub for all</font>

982
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:38,489
the functions it's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you but this</font>

983
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:41,099
aim of this document<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list all the</font>

984
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:44,640

985
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:47,759
in for one of those functions they make

986
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,170
still continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use yang or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BG pls but</font>

987
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:51,390
first another functions they want to use

988
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:55,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">P sub so that flexibility could also be</font>

989
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:56,969
useful so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the four functions</font>

990
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:59,640
the functions were<font color="#CCCCCC"> multidomain</font>

996
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:15,749
stitched LSP mechanism is quite useful

997
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:18,289
to achieve the multi domain coordination

998
00:54:15,749 --> 00:54:21,808
as well as for the customer mapping and

999
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:24,150
translation the P sub LS part with the

1000
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:26,609
support for virtual networks and the

1001
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:29,039
various abstraction methods that we have

1002
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:30,869
talked in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> t's working group can also</font>

1003
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,349
meet the virtualization and the

1004
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:38,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">abstraction function of the actn to map</font>

1005
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:42,180
between the virtual networks and the

1006
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:44,460
LSPs the VN<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association our draft help</font>

1007
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:46,740
to achieve this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the map</font>

1008
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:49,320
basically saying that how the various

1009
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:51,330
actn functions can be achieved why are

1010
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:55,440
these extensions which are already

1011
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:57,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">available in the P sub space so what</font>

1012
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,120
what are the changes that we did as I

1013
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,650
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we clarified that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PCF is not</font>

1014
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,109
mandatory we are not saying with this

1015
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:06,360
route that p sub needs to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

1016
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:08,310
but we are giving a possibility that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1017
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:12,240
you want to use P sub these are a set of

1018
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:14,790
tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should use we also added</font>

1019
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:18,839
a reference to other drafts like

1020
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:20,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Association policy or the state sing as</font>

1021
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,640
well as the various abstraction methods

1022
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:26,310
so how that is applicable within<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CDN</font>

1023
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:29,339
context we also gotta come in to specify

1024
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:31,080
how does this relate to ECE base central

1025
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:33,480
control so we added a separate section

1026
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:37,080
that describes what is the relationship

1027
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:41,280
between the two and this also handles

1028
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:43,170
those comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so final side we</font>

1029
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,590
want to know what's the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to</font>

1030
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:48,600
progress our documents the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

1031
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:52,410
that some parts are independent they are

1032
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:54,690
not actn specific per se<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think the</font>

1033
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:57,270
stateful<font color="#CCCCCC"> HPC and the piece fls they have</font>

1034
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:59,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">their validity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or on their own but then</font>

1035
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:01,290
we have the acct<font color="#E5E5E5"> and specific drugs</font>

1036
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:05,009
which are the acct and applicability and

1037
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:07,290
the VN<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association so we need to figure</font>

1038
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:09,780
it out as a working group what is the

1039
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:12,990
order that we are progressing in or how

1040
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:15,060
are we handling this you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen</font>

1041
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:18,149
the some implementation reports we

1042
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:19,680
presented in the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF as well as</font>

1043
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,480
well as there were some discussions on

1044
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,759
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list where people are saying</font>

1045
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:27,510
that part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they have implemented</font>

1046
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,770
so far we feel that we have able to

1047
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:31,620
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the comments that we have</font>

1048
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:34,740
received now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to figure it out in</font>

1049
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:37,880
which order we could see the work moving

1050
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,879
thank you

1051
00:56:42,289 --> 00:56:49,589
any comments the truth hi my name is

1052
00:56:47,999 --> 00:56:51,509
michael<font color="#CCCCCC"> zhrov this relates to the</font>

1053
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:53,430
question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

1054
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:55,229
morning or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmi interface if you go</font>

1055
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:59,819
to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 where you</font>

1056
00:56:55,229 --> 00:57:01,229
show you know it was the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> way but</font>

1057
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:03,569
they are yet that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third one here</font>

1058
00:57:01,229 --> 00:57:06,058
and actually I thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the VN</font>

1059
00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:10,079
concept is on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmi interface in actn</font>

1060
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:13,410
now you extend p<font color="#E5E5E5"> sep for the yen concept</font>

1061
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:16,200
but you don't show it on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interface</font>

1062
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:18,779
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this point said this morning</font>

1063
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:22,710
it's confusing what exactly the role<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1064
00:57:18,779 --> 00:57:25,140
CNY is and why what a VN concept this

1065
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,849
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also think it's still unclear why</font>

1066
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:29,009
you need that extension in piece of here

1067
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:30,809
but the bleeders can be clarified by

1068
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:32,549
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's an issue in the actn</font>

1069
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:35,549
architecture as a whole and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way I</font>

1070
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:40,288
mean the MMI interface is not well

1071
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:42,210
defined in actn i leave the actn part of

1072
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:44,729
that maybe we can focus on the piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1073
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:46,319
yeah yes what it is about don't have any

1074
00:57:44,729 --> 00:57:47,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">concern for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the feasible right now but</font>

1075
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,038
as tell us that I think there's an

1076
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:52,769
unclear<font color="#CCCCCC"> T in the AC Chen part of this</font>

1077
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:54,809
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think for the VN part of the</font>

1078
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:57,359
presentation it's unclear<font color="#CCCCCC"> how this</font>

1079
00:57:54,809 --> 00:58:00,650
exactly ties into actn but this is an

1080
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:04,769
easy to issue it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a piece of issue</font>

1081
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:06,269
handled that as a part of easy deal yeah

1082
00:58:04,769 --> 00:58:09,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was always going to say that sounds</font>

1083
00:58:06,269 --> 00:58:10,738
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> general actn issue so i think i</font>

1084
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:17,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">think probably the way we would proceed</font>

1085
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:19,410
is by looking at the applicability as

1086
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:24,749
being sort of the primary document for

1087
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:26,549
now and and staple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hpca is being sort of</font>

1088
00:58:24,749 --> 00:58:31,828
an independent track and look at those

1089
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:35,160
two and the VN<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess um let's get by</font>

1090
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:41,460
clarified in the actn architecture that

1091
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:44,819
looks uglier elbows<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um so on just</font>

1092
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:48,529
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check quickly has anyone who has</font>

1093
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:48,529
read be applicability statement

1094
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:58,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have about 10 people okay and all</font>

1095
00:58:55,550 --> 00:59:02,680
those tan who would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font>

00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:02,680
applicability statement adopted by<font color="#CCCCCC"> pce</font>

1097
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:10,850
it's about almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same okay good and</font>

1098
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:16,400
how about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stateful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hpc</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II who is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> red</font>

1099

the stateful<font color="#CCCCCC"> hpc e rather more it's good</font>

1100
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:23,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay maybe 15 and who would like to see</font>

1101
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,380
that adopted by the pc working group

1102
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:31,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's like about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 okay well that's</font>

1103
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:32,990
a good start I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will confirm</font>

1104
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">both those on the mailing list thanks</font>

1112
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:17,370
don't want to remind you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the beauty</font>

them separately and we may stitch em

1131
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:26,930
possibly using some bgp mechanism there

1132
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:30,529
but as soon as you want to do some key

1133
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:34,669
there there are some missing points so

in a global em to analyse be<font color="#E5E5E5"> relying on</font>

do you think a political boss rsvp-te

1234
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:45,470
and sr a autonomous system so system

1235
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:48,109
remain autonomous in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> t2 inside</font>

1236
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:50,750

1244
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:23,089
at this job is very interesting so I

1245
01:08:20,328 --> 01:08:25,519
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are trying to make the piece</font>

1246
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:29,328
if to have the essential on

1247
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:31,489
functionality of us with here right it

1248
01:08:29,328 --> 01:08:36,528
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you are trying to use hyssop</font>

multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> domains yeah you may describe</font>

1251
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:47,509
it like this the glue between rather at

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TC level instead of at the network</font>

same naval domain has a part of the

1257
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:08,078
industry yeah so my question my comment

1258
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:13,730
is so on campus ship the price a sweetie

1263
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:33,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">have it yeah okay yeah so on another</font>

1264
01:09:28,328 --> 01:09:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">uncommon even do you think that if pccc</font>

1265
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:40,300
can adjust your own requirements if we

1266
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:43,339
have 0 as you promised

1268
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:50,689
maybe there are some woman anyway I

1269
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:56,869
perspective IDs made are some similar

1270
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:59,480
ideas there I don't think pccc solve the

1271
01:09:56,869 --> 01:10:03,469
blue of the stitching level let me try

1272
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:06,709
to address here but we may find some

common ground between<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas I</font>

1274
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:12,440
guess so maybe we could look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1275
01:10:09,949 --> 01:10:16,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">together in detail to see there is some</font>

1276
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:21,138
commonalities to be maybe progress

1277
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:23,840
together similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detail</font>

1278
01:10:21,139 --> 01:10:27,590
at that so I think if there's a

1279
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:31,780
centralized pccc and the pccc can stand

1280
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:36,500
you know kiss it to the pound Angelo's

1281
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:38,989
enter stitching to LSPs look to thank

1282
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Union yeah thank you thank you but I</font>

1283
01:10:38,989 --> 01:10:46,879
please please be brief<font color="#CCCCCC"> proof through I</font>

1284
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:49,070
like the idea I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sa label</font>

1285
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:52,340
thing is not tightly coupled to staple

1286
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:54,500
brtc in the sense staple hpc can may

1287
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,270
also need that kind of view so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1288
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,619
get the label thing and then the

1289
01:10:56,270 --> 01:11:00,139
question is how do we write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a</font>

1290
01:10:57,619 --> 01:11:02,269
general way I go back to Fatah that

1291
01:11:00,139 --> 01:11:05,139
maybe the pccc kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> way was much more</font>

1292
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:07,520
generous than this but it's kind of

1293
01:11:05,139 --> 01:11:09,560
dated other than that I have small

1294
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,619
currents which we can handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> offline but</font>

1295
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:14,719
overall this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one thing which I</font>

1296
01:11:12,619 --> 01:11:16,429
wanted to also talk about is that

1297
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:20,119
initiate message when it is coming from

1298
01:11:16,429 --> 01:11:21,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">a parent pc to child pc the relationship</font>

1299
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:24,348
is kind of known but when the initiate

1300
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:27,320
message goes on the fear level from one

1301
01:11:24,349 --> 01:11:29,330
pc<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's hearing you to another pc we</font>

1302
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,830
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more like the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">security issues and the manageability</font>

1304
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:35,960
parts of that relationship we may not

1305
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:39,230
have to evaluate<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit yeah oh we</font>

1306
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:41,389
on the bottom it's a zero version so<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know security is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left for further</font>

touch anything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain of all</font>

1310
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:52,070
securities even something to be

1313
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:58,969
take the rest of it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> west coast with</font>

1317
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:11,119
the mailing list and yeah hope that was

1318
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:18,469
useful thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1319
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:20,480
Rakesh rakesh we're a little squeezed

1320
01:12:18,469 --> 01:12:22,940
for time so if you could like<font color="#CCCCCC"> shake one</font>

1321
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:25,629
minute of each of your presentations

1322
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:25,629
that would be awesome

1323
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:49,179
good afternoon everyone my name is

1324
01:12:46,099 --> 01:12:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jacques candy and I'm presenting a</font>

1327
01:12:54,860 --> 01:13:02,598

01:13:00,769 --> 01:13:06,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the requirements and scope of this</font>

1330
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:12,409

01:13:08,869 --> 01:13:15,619
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will have a look we'll review</font>

1332
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:20,739
the PCF extensions proposing a document

1333
01:13:15,619 --> 01:13:23,960
and discuss the next steps so basically

1334
01:13:20,739 --> 01:13:25,968
<font color="#E5E5E5">associated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bidirectionally recipes have</font>

1336
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:34,159
networks in the RSVP world the recipes

1337
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:36,799
can be caught out<font color="#E5E5E5"> adorned on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> carotid so</font>

1338
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:40,699
the scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the document is the either</font>

1339
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:43,519
pc<font color="#E5E5E5"> or pcc initiated bidirectional other</font>

1340
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:45,650
space and it can also be user it's great

1341
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:50,869
that pc for example if you want to do a

1342
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:54,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">corrupted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> park competition so in case of</font>

1343
01:13:50,869 --> 01:13:59,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">double sided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the initiate initiation the</font>

1344
01:13:54,679 --> 01:14:01,699
pc initiates the LSP on both endpoint

1345
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:05,960
nodes there is a new Association type

1346
01:14:01,699 --> 01:14:08,799
defined for it and again LSP can be

1347
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:12,139
corrupted or non corrupted in this case

1348
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:15,440
and in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of single sided initiation</font>

1349
01:14:12,139 --> 01:14:17,300
the stateful PCE initiates the forward

1350
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:19,909
and reverse LSP on one end points of the

1351
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:22,909
bidirectional SP there is a new

1352
01:14:19,909 --> 01:14:25,909
Association type defined for it there is

1353
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:28,190
also a tlv for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> association that</font>

1354
01:14:25,909 --> 01:14:33,308
identifies the forward in reversal sv as

1355
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:33,308
well as can specify here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> karate flag</font>

1356
01:14:35,469 --> 01:14:39,240
so as men

1357
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:43,290
there are two a new Association types

1358
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:45,269
defined and the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the field in the</font>

1359
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Association objects are populated using</font>

1360
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:56,040
the RSVP RFC 75 751 so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a deal</font>

1361
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:58,889
we define for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association object</font>

1362
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:01,260
identifies<font color="#CCCCCC"> a forward forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LSP</font>

1363
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:04,760
reversal SP or if LSP is caught out it

1364
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:04,760
which can be used for path computation

1365
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:13,200
so it's fairly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short and straight</font>

1366
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:16,110
forward a document so we appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1367
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:17,970
review comments and suggestions so is

1368
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:20,969
this song slightly useful to have in the

1369
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:24,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">pce wall it's heavily used in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recipe</font>

1370
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:28,730
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport networks and if we</font>

1371
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:28,730
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests for working of adoption</font>

1372
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:36,690
um so thanks for caching max if I keep

1373
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:44,010
in my short I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to take</font>

1374
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:46,290
those questions one at a time so before

1375
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:48,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">we get to the working reproduction call</font>

1376
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:50,820
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need to see some some</font>

1377
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:52,470
comments and suggestions on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft</font>

1378
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,450
but we can certainly ask the first

1379
01:15:52,470 --> 01:16:03,180
question who thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is useful</font>

1380
01:15:54,450 --> 01:16:06,179
functionality to have yeah like 12

1381
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:09,030
people or so so yes I mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds</font>

1382
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:11,460
like there's decent support for working

1383
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:15,950
on this will be good to to see some

1384
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:15,950
comments and support on the list

1385
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:33,650
so good afternoon again I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> request</font>

1386
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:36,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Guardian presenting this draft am on</font>

1387
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:39,379
behalf of the authors this is for the PC

1388
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:43,370
piece of extensions for reporting the

1389
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:48,380
pls p PM parameters when<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the</font>

1390
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:51,500
stateful pc so agenda is<font color="#CCCCCC"> as following</font>

1391
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll look at the requirement and scope</font>

1392
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:58,700
of the document followed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the overview</font>

1393
01:16:55,070 --> 01:17:02,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the piece of extensions the PM matrix</font>

1394
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:05,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">are delay loss and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bennett utilization</font>

1395
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:07,130
there is also a multiplication message

1396
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:13,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">defined and then we'll discuss the next</font>

1397
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:17,360
steps so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our first to give a high level</font>

1398
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:21,590
picture or the protocol landscape on the

1399
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:25,730
left side we have RFC's and graphs that

1400
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:29,600
deals with those metrics for the links

1401
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:32,120
those are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igt and bgp extensions we</font>

1402
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:35,900
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the service aware draft in pc</font>

1403
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:38,960
to use those extensions for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> csv f</font>

1404
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:44,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">park computation on the right side we</font>

1405
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:49,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">had those extensions for te LSPs so we</font>

1406
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:53,269
have RS RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6334 and 7806 for example to</font>

1407
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:56,050
measure the those metrics what's missing

1408
01:17:53,270 --> 01:18:00,770
is that stateful<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc is not aware of</font>

1409
01:17:56,050 --> 01:18:07,220
those up performance metrics so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1410
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:09,560
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> district is addressing so</font>

1411
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:12,260
basically requirements off<font color="#E5E5E5"> our that</font>

1412
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:16,010
there is a need for the stateful PCE to

1413
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:19,250

is that how this matrix are used by the

01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:45,190
that's defined we also defining delay

your review comments and suggestions is

01:23:12,429 --> 01:23:19,540
this use useful functionality to have in

nokia so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a the capability is useful</font>

1498
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:34,060
would I do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way no especially</font>

1499
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:38,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">since I have this available today and</font>

1500
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:41,650
there are mechanisms develop design for

1501
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,810
scale that do not overload protocol like

1502
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:47,909
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do it with telemetry</font>

1503
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:51,340
you can do with any other things that

1504
01:23:47,909 --> 01:23:53,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">this type of mechanisms are not scaling</font>

1505
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:59,110
that's why we can have with a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

1506
01:23:53,350 --> 01:24:02,949
more at scale mechanisms and other pc me

1507
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:07,179
has enough of the work to do to set up

1508
01:24:02,949 --> 01:24:09,549
and react<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to LSPs that overloading it</font>

1509
01:24:07,179 --> 01:24:17,070
with collecting performance information

1510
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:17,070
and she seems risky so I

1511
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:24,050
yeah the motivation is that pc is

1512
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:27,620
already getting a lot of LSP state

1513
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:29,420
information yrp subchannel so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1514
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:31,550
just a distant information that it would

1515
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:33,380
have everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> at one place instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1516
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:38,050
having two channels or four different

1517
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:38,050
purpose but that's the motivation

1518
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:43,490
exactly saying you're overloading stuff

1519
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:45,230
and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get their</font>

1520
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:47,809
performance issues they are like it if

1521
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:50,679
you want to have this to really be a

1522
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:54,470
centralized control<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing at scale</font>

1523
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:57,680
having one channel to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand a lot of</font>

1524
01:24:54,470 --> 01:25:01,580
things it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not helping and and we</font>

1525
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:03,530
breaking this purposely so there is this

1526
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:08,660
this is useful functionality it's

1527
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:12,320
available can be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see like I</font>

1528
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:15,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">really don't see any anything new other</font>

1529
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:17,960
than adding stuff into the protocol

1530
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:24,170
doing it differently doesn't mean

1531
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:25,790
necessarily better<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay please please</font>

1532
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:27,620
try to keep your comments as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1533
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:29,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible with your general de de las one</font>

1534
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:33,730
attached speaking we do now turn to

1535
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:33,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are pictured out the relationship</font>

1536
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:43,190
the first one yet this one no is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font>

1537
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:45,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this one so in this picture you</font>

1538
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:48,589
describe the relationship in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your draft</font>

1539
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:53,950
and current upstage know so that you

1540
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:56,840
knew lon don't mention on<font color="#CCCCCC"> p CEOs job</font>

1541
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:59,230
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually and measurement</font>

1542
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:05,390
information part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the link information</font>

1543
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:08,059
so i think peace EE LS it had very close

1544
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:13,100
relationship between your job and she

1545
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:15,650
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i asked yes yeah so so bgp igp is</font>

1546
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:22,760
there we can also add<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the GPL that</font>

1547
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:27,650
step yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm saying pretty much same</font>

1548
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:30,140
concerns ng yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> breast so my question do</font>

1549
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:31,679
you plan to<font color="#E5E5E5"> only measure performance</font>

1550
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:34,220
from adam respect

1551
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:38,940
or on behalf of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rinat in the network</font>

1552
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:41,430
yeah so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PCC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hadn't sent to</font>

1553
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:43,080
end performance from the head end but

1554
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:45,090
there's no association this particular

1555
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:48,600
LSP so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I presume we will be just</font>

1576
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:03,150
is sir ah this is what we have discussed

1577
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:06,960
in previous idea meeting and we have

1578
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:08,730
received some major comments the first

1579
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:12,660
is the motivation requirements and the

1580
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:15,780
use cases we have troops prepare also we

1581
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:18,990
have just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a documenting tease to discuss</font>

1582
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:21,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> motivation and requirements and</font>

1583
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:24,540
finally we get some consensus in these

1584
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:26,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">groups as we decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the architecture</font>

1585
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:29,970
for this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people think this</font>

1586
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good direction to go so now we come</font>

1587
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:37,140
up back to tease our PPC to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to</font>

1588
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:40,080
provide the solution so the second

1589
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:43,050
question about the solution is how the

1590
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:44,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">pcc schedule will be synchronized</font>

1591
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:49,500
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc and a piece</font>

1592
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:51,840
PCCs the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we use the pc report</font>

1593
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:55,230
and the request<font color="#E5E5E5"> and updated messager to</font>

1594
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:57,540
do the synchronization and the last one

1595
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:59,730
is there are two jobs on the same

1596
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:02,250
problems so we work with other authors

1597
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:04,799
who provide a merge diversion which is

1598
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:08,070
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the web sites people can</font>

1599
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:11,489
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much fortune and there are</font>

1600
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:14,429
some updates in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new version and the</font>

1601
01:29:11,489 --> 01:29:16,739
the most important<font color="#CCCCCC"> is yeah we two jobs</font>

1602
01:29:14,429 --> 01:29:19,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">has merged into the single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solution for</font>

1603
01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:22,559
the problem we have discussed in case

1604
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:25,560
and the extra features for this version

1605
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:29,400
is we add the terrific<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allaire SP</font>

1606
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:32,400
scattering from the high most jobs and

1607
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:35,759
also we provide a quick graceful period

1608
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:38,400
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> alaska time interval for the for</font>

1609
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:41,159
the scattering which can make the people

1610
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:44,040
can have more choices for the RSP

1611
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:47,129
scattering work and we also add a new

1612
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:50,340
section for the RSP<font color="#CCCCCC"> update so what if we</font>

1613
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:53,130
have already have a scheduled a resp but

1614
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:57,270
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update the information and</font>

1615
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:59,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">some editorial changes so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1616
01:29:57,270 --> 01:30:02,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">home page of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PCA extension for</font>

1617
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:04,620
there's a resp scattering and this is

1618
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:08,400
the architecture we have decided in the

1619
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:10,710
teeth dropped and during this in this

1620
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:14,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we just provide some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peace app</font>

1621
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:19,550
extension border up to carry on the time

1622
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:26,550
information between the PCC and the PCEs

1623
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:28,920
so next step so yeah we have make some

1624
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:31,560
congruent is for the architecture and

1625
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program itself so now we come up to</font>

1626
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:38,219
the pset to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> the extension and</font>

1627
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:40,920
provided a solution so now two jobs

1628
01:30:38,219 --> 01:30:42,600
being merged into the single one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

1629
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:45,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">single solution for this problem and</font>

1630
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:51,420
then we want to ask the group whether

1631
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:54,330
it's ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the adopt we may get one</font>

1638
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:17,430
the merger of the two initiatives which

1639
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:20,670
is a very good step for one I don't
